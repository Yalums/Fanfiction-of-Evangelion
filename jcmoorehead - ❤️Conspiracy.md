### Chapter 1 New Recruit

_April 11th 2015 2015 年 4 月 11 日_

**Tokyo-3 Suburbs – 2100 hours  
东京-3 郊区 —— 晚上 21:00**

Three seconds, an incredibly small amount of time, yet within the space of just three seconds it's amazing just what can happen. Of course many people would never take such a thing into consideration in a small suburb, just what can happen in three seconds? It wasn't a question that Haruka Itou had ever asked herself as she put her young daughter to bed that night. She tucked the young girl in and kissed her on the forehead.  
三秒钟，一个极其短暂的时间，然而在仅仅三秒钟内，发生的奇迹却令人惊叹。当然，许多人不会在这样一个小郊区考虑这种事情，三秒钟内能发生什么呢？那天晚上，在给年幼的女儿盖好被子时，Haruka Itou 从未问过自己这个问题。她给小女孩盖好被子，并在她的额头上轻轻一吻。

"Night night, darling." “晚安，亲爱的。”

"Good night, mommy." “晚安，妈妈。”

Haruka stood up and went over and turned off the light, smiling as she looked at her daughter sleeping peacefully, just as she had done for many years now. She silently closed the door, and that was when the screaming started.  
遥站起身，走过去关掉了灯，微笑着看着女儿安详地入睡，就像多年来她一直做的那样。她默默地关上门，就在这时，尖叫声开始了。

_1…_

Haruka desperately tried to reopen the door only to find that somehow it had been locked from the inside, just as the screaming started a white glow seemed to fill the inside of the room.  
遥拼命试图重新打开门，却发现门不知怎么从里面锁上了，就在尖叫声开始时，房间内似乎充满了白色的光芒。

_2…_

The glow kept on intensifying as she kept on trying to enter the room, only to find the handle was too hot to touch. The screaming subsided, along with the glow.  
随着她不断尝试进入房间，光芒愈发强烈，却发现门把手烫得无法触碰。尖叫声与光芒一同消退。

_3…_

Haruka was able to move back into her daughter's room, only to find it was empty. Shaking violently, she turned on the light and called out her daughter's name. She screamed as she was greeted with the sight of a trail of blood leading up to the closed window. Three seconds, that's all it takes for someone's life to fall apart.  
遥终于能回到女儿的房间，却发现里面空无一人。她颤抖着打开灯，呼唤女儿的名字。眼前的一幕让她尖叫出声——血迹一路延伸至紧闭的窗户。只需三秒钟，一个人的生活就能支离破碎。

**Nerv Headquarters - 0915 hours  
NERV 总部 - 0915 时**

Asuka sighed heavily as she waited for the elevator to arrive to take her to the basement level of NERV headquarters. She had once been excited about the prospect of being transferred to the main NERV HQ and also being assigned to a special division, after all for a twenty seven year old agent to be sent to the main headquarters in Tokyo-3 after only being a few months out of the academy was a big achievement. Then she had heard just who she was working with, a man by the name of Shinji Ikari. When she first heard the name she had thought nothing of it, he'll just be your partner, we'll work together on cases and that'll be it, this was until she had heard the rumours.  
明日香重重地叹了口气，等待电梯的到来，带她前往 NERV 总部的地下层。她曾对被调到 NERV 总部并被分配到一个特别部门的前景感到兴奋，毕竟对于一个二十七岁的特工来说，仅从学院毕业几个月就能被派往东京-3 的总部，这是一项重大成就。然而，当她得知将与谁共事时，她的心情就变了，那人名叫碇真嗣。起初听到这个名字，她并未多想，只是以为他会是她的搭档，两人将一起处理案件，仅此而已。直到她听到了那些传闻。

Shinji was not an ordinary NERV Agent, he had been in NERV for a few years longer than she had, but was around the same age. After a bit of scouting around from fellow agents, Asuka had heard quite a few stories and nicknames for Shinji, none of them were putting him in a very good light. It wasn't that he was a bad agent, in fact he was very skilled and talented, it's just the way he acted. Shinji was one of those who believed in the paranormal and the extraterrestrial, he was also the one who had resurrected a long forgotten area of NERV.  
真嗣并非普通的 NERV 特工，他在 NERV 的时间比她长几年，但年龄相仿。通过向其他特工打听，明日香听到了不少关于真嗣的故事和绰号，这些都没有给他带来什么好名声。并非他是个糟糕的特工，实际上他非常娴熟且有才华，只是他的行为方式如此。真嗣是那种相信超自然现象和外星生命的人，他也是那个复活了 NERV 一个长期被遗忘区域的人。

It wasn't hard for her to understand why Shinji was the way he was, his mother disappeared when he was a young boy and he was subsequently abandoned by his father. Asuka could sympathize with that, she too had lost her mother at a young age but that didn't mean she went around blaming green men in the sky or uncovering god knows what in an abandoned area of NERV.  
她不难理解真嗣为何会变成这样，他的母亲在他年幼时失踪，随后又被父亲抛弃。明日香对此感同身受，她也在年幼时失去了母亲，但这并不意味着她会四处指责天上的绿人，或在 NERV 的废弃区域揭开什么神秘的东西。

Asuka had read about the cases this area stored, unexplained phenomena, reports of abduction, reports of monsters and anything else that couldn't be explained through conventional means was just dumped there and forgotten about until one Shinji Ikari decided to reopen it. This bothered Asuka a lot, she wasn't what you would call open minded towards this sort of thing she preferred to stick with what could be proven and take a more scientific approach to solving cases. Of course she enjoyed a challenge but she wasn't intending to be in this section for long. She was beginning to question just why she of all people was assigned to this when the elevator finally arrived. Sighing heavily the young red head stepped inside towards her new assignment.  
明日香曾读过这个区域存放的案件，那些无法解释的现象，绑架报告，怪物目击记录，以及其他一切无法用常规手段解释的事情，都被丢弃在这里，直到某位碇真嗣决定重新开启它们。这让明日香感到非常困扰，她不是那种对这类事情持开放态度的人，她更倾向于坚持可证明的事实，并采用更科学的手段来解决案件。当然，她喜欢挑战，但她并不打算在这个部门待太久。她开始质疑，为什么偏偏是她被分配到这里，当电梯终于到达时，她重重地叹了口气，年轻的红发女孩踏入电梯，前往她的新任务。

_Why do I have to be stuck with some idiot with his head up in space when I could be doing something useful for NERV?  
为什么我得和一个脑袋空空如也的傻瓜一起工作，而不是为 NERV 做些有用的事？_

**Basement Offices – 0920 hours  
地下室办公室 – 09:20**

Shinji happily tapped his fingers on his desk to the beat of some song playing on the radio. He glanced at his watch and took another look at the case file in front of him, another disappearance in the Tokyo 3 suburbs. The fifth this month, this time it was a young girl. Her mother a Haruka Itou had contacted the police to report it, who, when they found nothing to discover how the child has gone missing, had called in NERV. Of course the case had attracted Shinji's attention and now he and his new partner, who would be arriving soon, were to be working on it.  
真嗣愉快地用手指敲打着桌面，随着广播里播放的某首歌曲的节奏。他瞥了一眼手表，再次看向面前的那份案件档案，这是东京第三新城区本月第五起失踪案，这次失踪的是一个小女孩。她的母亲，一位名叫伊藤遥的女性，已经联系了警方报案，但警方在调查中一无所获，于是便请来了 NERV。当然，这个案件引起了真嗣的注意，现在他和即将到来的新搭档将要着手处理此事。

At first glance the case seemed like a typical child abduction case, a simple matter of the intruder breaking into the house and abducting the child. However, when looked into in more detail there was much more to it. For a start there were no signs of an intruder entering or exiting the house, secondly there was a trail of blood leading from the bed to the window, yet nothing in the area outside the window and third the entire ordeal only took a matter of three seconds.  
乍一看，这起案件似乎是一起典型的儿童绑架案，简单来说就是入侵者闯入家中绑走了孩子。然而，深入调查后发现事情远不止如此。首先，没有任何入侵者进出房屋的迹象，其次，从床边到窗户有一条血迹，但窗外区域却没有任何痕迹，第三，整个过程仅持续了三秒钟。

A few theories had already been passed around by other people, one of the most popular was that it was the mother who done it, but if that was the case then how come the other four cases were identical? Shinji himself had a theory after digging through case files relating to similar incidents fifteen years ago, and again fifteen years before that.  
已有几种理论在其他人之间流传，其中最受欢迎的是认为凶手是母亲，但如果真是这样，那其他四起案件为何如出一辙？真嗣本人在深入研究了十五年前以及再往前十五年的类似案件档案后，也有了自己的理论。

He neatly folded the files back into the case folder and awaited the arrival of his new partner who was at this moment just about to open the door to his office. As she walked in Shinji stood up ready to greet her.  
他利落地将文件重新折叠好放回案件夹中，等待新搭档的到来，此时她正准备推开他办公室的门。当她走进来时，真嗣站起身来准备迎接。

Asuka walked into the room and looked around, she was surprised at how neat and tidy it was. When she worked in her previous assignment her desk was always full of case files, mugs of coffee and god knows what else, yet Shinji's desk was neat and tidy, not only that but the entire office was tidy and well organized.  
明日香走进房间，环顾四周，她对这里的整洁感到惊讶。在她之前的任务中，她的办公桌上总是堆满了案件文件、咖啡杯以及天知道还有什么，然而真嗣的桌子却井井有条，不仅如此，整个办公室都干净整洁，井然有序。

"So you're the person they sent to check up on me?"  
"所以你就是他们派来查看我情况的人？"

She stared up at him wondering just what he was talking about.  
她抬头盯着他，不知道他在说什么。

_Check up on him? Hold on does he think I'm here investigating him or something?  
查看他？等等，他是不是以为我是来调查他什么的？_

"Eh?"

"Nothing, it doesn't matter."  
“没什么，没关系。”

_Idiot_

He looked a lot different than she had imagined from what she had been told. She had expected him to look like those whacked out conspiracy theorists she had read about in papers, the ones who got high on marijuana all day and talked about how second impact was a government conspiracy to mass abduct thousands of people. Instead she was greeted with a young man around her age, with brown hair and brown eyes and was fairly well built to go with it.  
他的样子与她从别人口中得知的想象大相径庭。她本以为他会像她在报纸上读到的那些疯狂的阴谋论者，那些整天吸食大麻，谈论二次冲击是政府大规模绑架民众阴谋的人。然而，她见到的却是一个与她年龄相仿的年轻人，棕色的头发和眼睛，身材也相当健壮。

Shinji too found himself surprised by Asuka's appearance. In his case he had expected someone in their mid forties and to look a lot older and miserable. Instead he got this red headed blue eyed young agent. Naturally this didn't stop Shinji's theory that she had been unwittingly sent here by the higher ups with the intention of closing this department down.  
真嗣也对明日香的样貌感到惊讶。在他看来，他本以为会见到一个四十多岁、看起来更老更悲惨的人。结果却是一个红发蓝眼的年轻特工。当然，这并没有阻止真嗣认为她是被高层无意中派来，意图关闭这个部门的。

"Anyway, I'm Agent Ikari, welcome. I'm sure you've heard about me."  
"总之，我是碇参事官，欢迎你。我确信你已经听说过我了。"

_He's not ignorant of his own fame at least.  
至少他对自己的名声并非一无所知。_

"I have heard something, but that doesn't really matter. I'm Agent Sohryu."  
"我确实听说过一些，但这并不重要。我是惣流特工。"

He eyed her up and down once more and then spoke again.  
他再次上下打量了她一番，然后再次开口。

"Well I'm sure you're wondering what we will be doing in this department."  
“好吧，我确信你一定想知道我们在这个部门会做些什么。”

Asuka nodded slightly, she had heard a brief explanation but wanted to see if Shinji could make it sound any less stupid.  
明日香微微点头，她已经听过一个简短的解释，但想看看真嗣能否说得没那么愚蠢。

"We investigate the cases that no one else really wants to, the ones that have no logical explanation or conclusion. We also look into cases which involve unexplained phenomena reports, like UFO Abductions, that sort of thing."  
"我们调查那些没人真正愿意接手的案件，那些没有合理解释或结论的。我们还关注涉及无法解释现象报告的案件，比如 UFO 绑架事件，诸如此类的。"

Shinji's explanation made it sound a little more sane but she still thought the guy was deluded if he thought they could somehow solve cases that others could. Still she enjoyed a challenge and would show just how good an agent she was and then be out of this department as soon as possible.  
真嗣的解释听起来稍微合理些，但她仍然认为如果他以为他们能解决其他人都解决不了的案件，那他一定是自欺欺人。不过她喜欢挑战，会展示出自己作为特工的优秀能力，然后尽快从这个部门脱身。

"I can tell by the look on your face you're not really too happy about being here, but I'm sure the higher ups will recognize your work after a few cases and then you'll be out of here. Then it'll most likely be shut down and everyone will be happy."  
"从你的表情我能看出，你并不太高兴待在这里，但我相信高层在处理了几起案件后会认可你的工作，到时你就能离开这里。之后这个部门很可能会被关闭，大家都会高兴的。"

_Except me of course but what does that matter to other people?  
除了我当然，但这与别人何干？_

Asuka frowned at Shinji's last comment.  
明日香对真嗣的最后一句话皱起了眉头。

_Wow this guy doesn't really have much confidence in himself.  
哇，这家伙对自己真没什么信心。_

"Don't be an idiot, my intention isn't to see you get shut down or anything I'm just here to work. So what's our first case then?"  
"别犯傻，我来的目的不是看你关门大吉什么的，只是来工作的。那我们的第一个案子是什么？"

For the first time that morning Asuka noticed Shinji smiling genuinely. She wasn't sure if it was because of what she had just said or because of what he was about to show her, but either way it made her feel a bit better about being there. She watched him as he opened up a folder on his desk and lay out several photo's. Each one showing a child's room, a puddle of blood on the bed and also leading up towards the window.  
那天早上，明日香第一次注意到真嗣真正地笑了。她不确定是因为她刚才说的话，还是因为他即将展示给她的东西，但无论如何，这让她对在那里感到稍微好受些。她看着他打开桌上的一个文件夹，摊开几张照片。每张照片都显示一个孩子的房间，床上有一滩血迹，还延伸到窗户附近。

"I'm guessing you already know what these photo's are?"  
"我猜你已经知道这些照片是什么了吧？"

She studied the photo's for a few moments before replying in a very matter of fact way.  
她仔细研究了几张照片，然后以一种非常实事求是的方式回答。

"Of course these are the disappearances of the children in the suburbs to the east of Tokyo-3, the media has been all over these incidents."  
“当然，这些是东京-3 东部郊区儿童失踪的案件，媒体已经对这些事件进行了大量报道。”

"Close, but look again at the photos."  
“接近了，但再仔细看看这些照片。”

She studied the photo's again not quite sure what Shinji was talking about. She looked at each one closely counting each one as she went through them.  
她再次审视那些照片，不太确定真嗣在说什么。她仔细地逐一查看，每翻过一张就默默数着。

_One… Two… Three…Four... Five… Six… Seven  
一……二……三……四……五……六……七_

As she hit the seventh photo that was when it hit her, there had only been five disappearances covered in the media.  
当她数到第七张照片时，突然意识到不对劲，媒体报道的失踪案只有五起。

"There are seven of them, so that means there have been two more victims?"  
"他们有七个人，那意味着还有另外两名受害者？"

"Close again, except these photo's are from a series of disappearances in 1985, in what we know as Tokyo-1."  
"又接近了，不过这些照片来自 1985 年的一系列失踪案，也就是我们所知的东京-1。"

"1985? So why are you showing me case files from 1985?"  
"1985 年？那你为什么给我看 1985 年的案件档案？"

"Same reason I'm about to show you these."  
"和你即将看到的这些照片一样的原因。"

Asuka glared at Shinji as he put all the photos into a pile and then took seven more images out of the folder and laid them out across the table. She counted them all in order then compared them to the pile of photos on the desk.  
明日香瞪着真嗣，只见他将所有照片堆成一叠，然后又从文件夹里取出七张新的照片，平铺在桌面上。她逐一清点后，将它们与桌上的那堆照片进行了对比。

"These ones are different."  
"这些是不同的。"

"Of course, these ones were taken in 2000 a few months before second impact in the city of Osaka."  
"当然，这些照片是在 2000 年拍摄的，就在第二次冲击前几个月的大阪市。"

He piled up the seven photos again and then took five more photos out of the folder.  
他把这七张照片重新叠在一起，然后又从文件夹里拿出了五张照片。

"These are the disappearances that have been in the media lately, the five disappearances of the children in the suburbs of Tokyo-3. In each case the parent has said that they put their child to bed then they heard screaming, a bright light and then three seconds later it was all over and this is what was found."  
"这些是最近媒体上报道的失踪事件，东京-3 郊区的五名儿童失踪案。每个案例中，家长都表示他们把孩子哄睡后，听到了尖叫声、一道强光，然后三秒钟后一切都结束了，这就是现场发现的情况。"

He put the photos back into the folder before continuing to speak.  
他把照片重新放回文件夹，然后继续说道。

"When I looked through the files for the cases fifteen and thirty years ago each one had the same pattern. Child is put to bed, and then three seconds later they're gone, leaving behind only a trail of blood. In each one the police have never found any traces of entry to the room and the children have never turned up again."  
当我查阅十五年前和三十年前的案件档案时，每个案件都有着相同的模式。孩子被安置入睡，紧接着三秒钟后他们就消失了，只留下一串血迹。每个案件中，警方从未发现任何进入房间的痕迹，而这些孩子也再未出现过。

Asuka let all the information soak in and then turned her mind to coming up with a solution to what was happening. In murder cases or abduction cases it was common to see the killer or abductor sticking to some form of pattern, it was how they worked, but for something to date back almost thirty years was a bit farfetched for her. The big question was that if it was the same person then why wait fifteen years between each series of abductions, which led to the most logical explanation.  
明日香让所有信息在脑海中沉淀，然后开始思考解决当前事件的方法。在谋杀案或绑架案中，凶手或绑架者通常会遵循某种模式，这是他们的作案方式，但追溯到近三十年前的事件对她来说有些牵强。最大的问题是，如果这是同一人所为，为何要在每次绑架系列之间等待十五年，这导致了最合乎逻辑的解释。

"Ok, so clearly it's either the same people or group or people working on some form of pattern, or it's a copycat."  
"好吧，显然要么是同一伙人或团体在搞某种模式，要么就是模仿犯。"

"Makes sense but if it's a person or group it stills leaves several things unexplained, for example the bright light or the fact that there are no signs of entry."  
"有道理，但如果是个体或团体，仍有许多未解之谜，比如那道强光，或是没有任何侵入迹象的事实。"

"Ok, so what do you suggest?"  
"好吧，那你有什么建议？"

"Reports of alien abduction are in a similar manner, a bright light envelops the victim and takes them away. There is also the possibility that it's some sort of cult, in each case it's been single mothers losing their son's or daughters which points to the fact that all these ladies are involved in some sort of cult there at a certain time. Seven of them are selected to sacrifice their children to appease some sort of god or demon."  
"关于外星人绑架的报告与此类似，一束强光笼罩受害者并将其带走。也有可能是某种邪教所为，每一起案件都是单亲妈妈失去儿子或女儿，这表明这些女士在某个特定时间都参与了某种邪教。其中七人被选中牺牲自己的孩子，以取悦某种神灵或恶魔。"

"But this is Tokyo-3 and it's not exactly known for its cult activity, and I seriously hope you're not about to tell me this is some sort of abduction case."  
"但这里是东京-3，并不以邪教活动著称，我真心希望你不是要告诉我这是一起绑架案。"

"That's what we're going to find out, we've been assigned this case and we're going to the site of the last abduction."  
"这就是我们要查明的事情，我们已经接手了这个案件，并将前往最近一次绑架发生的地点。"

"What do you hope to find?"  
"你希望找到什么？"

"I don't know yet, that's why we're going."  
"我还不知道，这就是我们为什么要去的原因。"

Asuka watched as Shinji put on his suit jacket and walked over towards the door, she was intrigued by the way he acted, he certainly seemed dedicated to the job even though he was, as she saw him to be, a bit strange. Maybe this new assignment would work out for her anyway, the case certainly didn't seem weird enough, the police in Tokyo-3 were well known for being a bit slow and overlooking things.  
明日香看着真嗣穿上西装外套，走向门口，她对他的一举一动感到好奇，他显然对工作非常投入，尽管在她看来，他有点古怪。也许这个新任务对她来说会是个好机会，这个案件似乎并不复杂，东京-3 的警察以反应迟缓和忽视细节而闻名。

**Tokyo-3 Suburbs – 1000 hours  
东京-3 郊区 —— 1000 时**

When Shinji and Asuka pulled up outside the Itou residence they found the house itself cordoned off with police tape and representatives from the media swarming around, trying to get interviews with the residents, police officers and anyone else passing by. Shinji sighed in disgust as he spotted one person trying to get a word with the clearly distressed mother.  
当真嗣和明日香驾车停在伊藤家外时，他们发现房子已被警方封锁，媒体代表蜂拥而至，试图采访居民、警察以及任何路过的人。真嗣厌恶地叹了口气，因为他注意到有人试图与明显心烦意乱的母亲交谈。

"Disgusting, is there anyone they won't try to talk to?"  
“真恶心，他们还有谁不想采访的吗？”

"Probably not, we'd better get inside the house before they start trying to talk to us."  
"大概不会，我们最好在他们开始试图和我们交谈之前进屋。"

Shinji nodded as he shut the car door. The two of them made their way over to the police officer guarding the entranceway to the house.  
真嗣点点头，关上了车门。两人朝着守在房子入口处的警察走去。

"Sorry no ent… oh you're from NERV?"  
"抱歉，禁止入……哦，你们是来自 NERV 的？"

Shinji held up his NERV ID Card.  
真嗣举起了他的 NERV 身份证。

"Agent's Shinji Ikari and Asuka Sohryu, we're here to investigate this case."  
“特工真嗣·碇和明日香·惣流，我们来调查此案。”

"In that case, go on in, we've already been through the house and found nothing though."  
“那么，请进吧，我们已经搜查过房子了，但什么也没发现。”

Shinji nodded and the two of them entered the house. As they entered, Shinji took a quick look around the entrance area, not really looking for anything in particular.  
真嗣点点头，两人一起走进了房子。进门时，真嗣迅速环顾了一下入口区域，并没有特别寻找什么。

"What are you looking for?"  
“你在找什么？”

"Nothing really, just scratches on the doorway or something like that."  
“没什么，就是看看门框上有没有刮痕之类的。”

"What, so now we're looking for an animal?"  
"什么，现在我们还要找动物？"

"I didn't say that, it's just we have to consider every option."  
"我没那么说，只是我们必须考虑所有可能性。"

Asuka sighed heavily as Shinji turned away and went into the living room.  
明日香重重地叹了口气，看着真嗣转身走进客厅。

_Ok I take it back, this guy is definitely a weirdo.  
好吧，我收回前言，这家伙绝对是个怪人。_

She then moved into the living room and saw Shinji talking to Mrs. Itou.  
她随后走进客厅，看到真嗣正在和伊藤太太交谈。

"Mrs. Itou, we're from NERV, we've been assigned the case of finding out exactly what happened to your daughter. We'd just like to ask you a few questions, if that's okay?"  
“伊藤太太，我们是 NERV 的，负责调查您女儿的确切遭遇。我们只是想问您几个问题，可以吗？”

"Y-Yes, go ahead." "好-好的，请说。"

Asuka just watched on in silence.  
明日香只是默默地旁观。

"Okay, on the night of her disappearance did you notice anything strange happening."  
"好的，在她失踪的那晚，你有没有注意到什么异常的事情发生？"

"Strange?" "奇怪吗？"

"Yes, a rustling in the bushes, TV's turning to static or any strange visions regarding your daughter."  
"是的，比如灌木丛中的沙沙声，电视突然变成静态，或者关于你女儿的任何奇怪幻象。"

"W-What are you talking about?"  
"你、你在说什么？"

"I..." "我..."

Asuka slapped her hand on her forehead and interrupted Shinji.  
明日香一巴掌拍在额头上，打断了真嗣。

"Mrs. Itou, its fine, you don't have to answer anything yet, could you please excuse me and Agent Ikari."  
"伊藤太太，没关系，您不必现在回答，请您先回避一下我和碇探员。"

"Uhh, sure" “呃，当然。”

Haruka moved out of the room, leaving a furious Asuka glaring at Shinji, who was just looking down at the ground.  
遥离开了房间，留下愤怒的明日香瞪着真嗣，后者只是低头看着地面。

"Are you completely stupid? What are you doing asking if she's seen any visions or anything, this is real life not some silly Sci-Fi TV show. Next thing you'll be asking if she's seen a giant of light in the neighborhood."  
“你是不是完全傻了？问她有没有看到什么幻象之类的，这是现实生活，不是什么愚蠢的科幻电视剧。接下来你是不是还要问她有没有在附近看到光之巨人？”

"Sorry I was just as..."  
"抱歉，我也只是……"

"Don't bother apologizing, let's just get on with the case. We should take a look at the kid's room."  
"别忙着道歉了，我们还是继续处理案件吧。应该去看看那孩子的房间。"

Shinji nodded and got up, slightly reeling a bit from Asuka being angry with him.  
真嗣点点头，站起身来，因明日香对他生气而略感摇晃。

_Doesn't matter anyway it's not like it makes a difference if we solve this case or not, it's just going to come to the same conclusion for me.  
反正无所谓，破不破这个案子对我来说都没差，结果还不是一样。_

Shinji was fully aware of how he was seen in NERV and how many people thought he had thrown what could have been a brilliant career away by delving into something like this, but he preferred it that way. He'd rather be someone working on his own than in a group of people, and besides, with his beliefs were shunned by most people anyway. He had been the same way since he was younger, shunning contact with others, he had only ever had one girlfriend and that was an awkward experience when he was about eighteen. It had really started when he lost his mother in a tragic accident many years ago and then his father simply abandoned him and left him under the care of his uncle. This had led to Shinji having a severe lack of confidence in himself and what he did, the only thing he had ever been truly determined about was what he was currently working on and even then as soon as he started he was sure the higher ups in NERV wanted to shut him down.  
真嗣很清楚自己在 NERV 中的形象，以及有多少人认为他为了钻研这种东西而放弃了一个本可以辉煌的职业生涯，但他宁愿如此。他宁愿独自工作，也不愿融入人群，况且他的信仰本就不被大多数人接受。从年轻时起，他就一直回避与他人接触，唯一的一次恋爱经历是在大约十八岁时，那是一次尴尬的体验。一切始于多年前母亲在一次悲惨事故中离世，随后父亲抛弃了他，将他托付给叔叔照顾。这导致真嗣极度缺乏自信，唯一让他坚定不移的，就是他目前正在研究的东西，即便如此，他一着手就开始怀疑 NERV 高层是否想让他停手。

_What's wrong with doing something I want to do?  
做我想做的事有什么错？_

He made his way up to the girl's bedroom and saw Asuka kneeling down over the puddle of blood and examining the trail leading up to the window. Shinji watched as she got up and moved over towards the window.  
他走上楼，来到女孩的卧室，看到明日香正跪在那摊血迹旁，检查着通向窗户的血迹。真嗣注视着她站起身，走向窗户。

_She doesn't like being around me, after this case I'll write a report to the director saying how good her work is and recommend she's transferred to somewhere better. It'll be best for both of us.  
她不喜欢和我待在一起，这个案子结束后，我会向局长写份报告，称赞她的工作表现，并建议将她调到一个更好的地方。这对我们俩都好。_

Looking back over towards the blood he noticed Asuka suddenly turn around to look at him.  
他回头看向那摊血迹，注意到明日香突然转过身来看着他。

"Are you even listening to me?"  
"你到底有没有在听我说话？"

"Eh? What?" "啊？什么？"

She sighed and repeated what she had just said.  
她叹了口气，重复了一遍她刚才说的话。

"Come and take a look at this trail, I think we might have found something that everyone else missed."  
"过来看看这条线索，我觉得我们可能发现了其他人错过的东西。"

He walked over and knelt beside her.  
他走过去，跪在她旁边。

"It's blood?" "这是血迹？"

"That's what it looks like at first glance but take a look a bit closer. If it was blood it would have dried up by now and wouldn't have pooled like it has in these sections."  
"乍一看确实像，但仔细瞧瞧。如果是血，现在早就干了，不会像这些部分那样积成一滩。"

She pointed out the sections to him.  
她向他指出那些部分。

"Also take a look at it a bit closer, it's hard to notice but its lighter then blood. It's got more of an orange tint to it."  
"再仔细看看，虽然不太容易注意到，但它比血颜色更浅。带点橘色调。"

He looked at her, unsure of what she was implying.  
他看着她，不确定她话中何意。

"So, what are you suggesting?"  
“那么，你是在暗示什么？”

"I'm not sure yet, but whatever left this trail behind, it wasn't from the daughter. I need to take a sample of this back to the NERV Labs, then we can take a closer look at what it is."  
“我还不太确定，但留下这条痕迹的，绝非那女孩。我需要带一份样本回 NERV 实验室，然后我们才能更仔细地研究这是什么。”

She reached into her jacket pockets and pulled out a small tube used to collect liquids. Asuka then moved over towards the bed and took a small sample of the blood before holding it up to the light.  
她伸手探入夹克口袋，掏出一支用于收集液体的小试管。随后，绫波零走向床边，取了一小份血液样本，举到灯光下仔细观察。

"This is definitely not blood."  
“这绝对不是血液。”

"If it's not blood then how come no ones spotted it until now?"  
“如果不是血液，那为何至今无人发现？”

"No one has probably looked, you hear about a girl going missing, you see a red liquid on the floor and you assume its blood. There's not need to look any closer or test it because it seems so obvious."  
"可能没人仔细看过，听说有个女孩失踪了，看到地板上有红色液体就以为是血。没必要再仔细检查或测试，因为看起来太明显了。"

Shinji was surprised at how easily Asuka was able to recognize it, he had studied the case files repeatedly and even he was unable to spot that fact. Maybe there was hope for them solving this case yet.  
真嗣对明日香能如此轻易地识别出这一点感到惊讶，他自己反复研究了案件档案，甚至都没能注意到这个事实。或许他们还有希望解决这个案子。

"Ok we'll check out the back garden see if we can find anything there, then we'll get this back to the labs."  
"好的，我们去后花园看看能不能找到什么，然后再把这个带回实验室。"

**Itou Residence Back Garden – 1015 hours  
伊藤宅后花园 – 1015 时**

Shinji stepped out into the garden and immediately turned and looked up at the house. He kept his eyes on the window at the top left of the house and then looked down at the floor. He did this a few more times until he caught Asuka looking at him in a funny way.  
真嗣踏入花园，立刻转身抬头望向房子。他的目光停留在房子左上角的窗户上，然后又低头看向地面。他重复了几次这个动作，直到注意到明日香正以一种奇怪的眼神看着他。

"What are you doing? Looking at where the mother ship could have landed?"  
“你在干嘛？找母舰可能降落的地方吗？”

"Very funny, no I'm just wondering, that's the girls bedroom right?"  
"非常搞笑，不，我只是好奇，那是女孩的卧室没错吧？"

"Yes…" "是的…"

"Ok so how does something open that window, take the kid, get back out the window, close the window and escape with the kid in the space of three seconds when said window is all the way up there?"  
"好吧，那么如何在三秒钟内打开那扇窗户，带走孩子，再从窗户出去，关上窗户并带着孩子逃走呢？那窗户可是高高在上啊！"

"Well like you said, isn't that what we're here to investigate?"  
"就像你说的，我们不就是为了调查这个才来的吗？"

"Ok, so let's look around, I'll take a look in the forest area."  
"好吧，那我们四处看看，我去森林那边瞧瞧。"

Asuka nodded as Shinji made his way over towards the back of the garden and through the gate into a small woodland area. The forest made the house an ideal location for the abduction to take place, it made perfect sense. The person would get into the house, take the kid and flee through the forest. Yet it made no sense that the person got into the kids bedroom and was able to flee making it look like no one had entered aside from the obvious liquid trail.  
真嗣朝花园后面走去，穿过一道小门进入了一片小树林，明日香点头表示同意。森林使得这栋房子成为绑架案发生的理想地点，这完全合乎逻辑。绑匪可以进入房子，带走孩子，然后通过森林逃走。然而，匪徒进入孩子的卧室并成功逃脱，现场看起来就像除了明显的液体痕迹外没有人进入过，这一点却让人费解。

He walked a bit further into the forest when he came to a clearing, it was a perfect circular clearing, almost as if it could be used for a campsite. Shinji was about to turn and head in the opposite direction when he spotted the figure of a man standing within the trees. He put his hand on his gun and shouted out towards the man.  
他继续深入森林，来到一片空地，这片空地呈完美的圆形，仿佛是专为露营而设。真嗣正准备转身朝相反方向走去，突然瞥见树丛中站着一个人影。他把手放在枪上，朝着那人大声喊道。

"Hey you, what are you doing in this area?"  
“嘿，你在这儿干什么？”

No reply came from the person, instead the figure began to run away from the clearing and from Shinji. Immediately, Shinji started running after the person.  
那人没有回答，反而开始逃离空地，远离真嗣。真嗣立刻追了上去。

"Stop right there, I'm a NERV Agent."  
"站住，我是 NERV 特工。"

Shinji chased the man for what seemed like ten minutes until he came to another clearing, not dissimilar to the one he was in before, except now there was no sign of the man. He was about to continue running after him when Asuka came out of the trees directly in front of him.  
真嗣追着那个男人，仿佛过了十分钟，直到他来到另一片空地，与之前的那片颇为相似，只是现在那男人已不见踪影。他正要继续追赶，这时明日香从他面前的树丛中走了出来。

"Agent Ikari, what are you doing?"  
"碇特工，你在做什么？"

"There's someone out here, he just ran in the direction you came from."  
"外面有人，他刚朝你来的方向跑了。"

"But how? I never saw anyone and I've just came directly from the Itou backyard."  
"但怎么可能？我一路上没看到任何人，我刚从伊藤家的后院直接过来的。"

Shinji looked up at her confused, he had just ran in a straight line directly from the Itou backyard, so how could he have emerged from the opposite side if he had ran in a straight line?  
真嗣困惑地抬头看着她，他刚才是直线从伊藤家的后院跑过来的，如果他是直线跑的，那怎么可能从相反的方向出现呢？

"Is everything alright, Agent Ikari?"  
"一切都还好吗，碇探员？"

"I… I just chased him directly from a clearing into this one, in a straight line directly from the Itou backyard."  
"我……我刚从一片空地直接追他到这片空地，从伊藤家的后院直线过来的。"

"That's impossible, I told you I've just came from there."  
"这不可能，我告诉过你我刚从那里过来。"

"I'm telling you, that's what happened."  
"我告诉你，事情就是这样。"

"He must have led you in a circle or something it's not a big forest if you had ran in a straight line you'd be on a main road by now."  
"他肯定带着你绕圈子了，这片森林不大，如果你一直直线跑的话，现在应该已经到主干道了。"

"I suppose you're right, let's go."  
"我想你说的对，我们走吧。"

Shinji moved over towards Asuka when just as he got to the center of the clearing he noticed something on the floor near him.  
真嗣向明日香那边挪去，当他走到空地的中央时，注意到地上有东西靠近他。

"Agent Langley, take a look at this."  
“兰格利特工，看看这个。”

"What is it?" "什么事？"

Shinji moved some of the leaves out of the way revealing what appeared to be a piece of paper with a child's handwriting on it, on the corner of the page was a dried orange liquid. On the center of the page was the word…  
真嗣拨开一些树叶，露出了一张看似儿童笔迹的纸片，纸角上有一块干涸的橙色液体。纸的中央写着……

_Sachiel… 萨基尔……_

### Chapter 2 Sachiel

**Basement Offices – 1400 hours  
地下室办公室 – 14 时整**

Shinji studied the piece of paper one more time and turned back to his computers monitor, looking down the list of search results. He clicked on a link and looked at the text that appeared on the screen It told him nothing new, only the same thing he had seen on the other thirty sites he had looked at, that Sachiel was the name of the Angel of Water. He pushed his keyboard and went back to waiting for Asuka to return from getting the liquid sample they had found and analyzed.  
真嗣再次审视了一遍那张纸条，然后转回电脑屏幕前，浏览着搜索结果列表。他点击了一个链接，看着屏幕上出现的文字，内容并无新意，只是重复了他之前在其他三十个网站上看到的信息——萨基尔是水之天使的名字。他推开键盘，继续等待明日香从取回并分析他们发现的液体样本回来。

Shinji had even looked over past case records in the NERV Database and the word Sachiel had never appeared once. It was a complete dead end as regards the name and there didn't seem to be any reason why the abductor would choose such a name.  
真嗣甚至翻阅了 NERV 数据库中的过往案件记录，但“萨基尔”这个词从未出现过一次。这个名字完全是个死胡同，而且似乎没有任何理由解释绑架者为何会选择这样一个名字。

_I just hope Agent Sohryu has had more luck then me.  
我只希望草薙特工比我更幸运些。_

Just at that moment the door to the office opened up and Asuka stepped through, clutching a folder and looking fairly displeased. She took off her jacket and hung it up, she then threw the folder down on her desk, cleared some of Shinji's junk off of it and pulled out a sandwich before eating. Shinji observed her silently, quite astonished that the woman had not even acknowledged his presence once within that entire minute it took her to storm into the room and then move to her lunch. He opened his mouth to speak.  
就在那一刻，办公室的门打开了，明日香走了进来，手里紧抓着一个文件夹，看起来相当不悦。她脱下外套挂好，然后将文件夹扔在桌上，清理了一些真嗣的杂物，拿出一个三明治开始吃。真嗣默默地观察着她，非常惊讶这个女人在那一分钟内完全无视了他的存在，从闯进房间到开始吃午饭。他张开嘴准备说话。

"So how di..." “那么，怎……”

Asuka slammed her sandwich down on the table and snarled at him.  
明日香猛地将三明治拍在桌上，对他咆哮道。

"Don't ask…" "别问了……"

"I see you're in a good mood then."  
"看来你心情不错。"

He smiled at her, but it was promptly wiped from his face when she gave him a look that might just have killed him. She then went back to eating her sandwich but this time continued talking.  
他对她微笑，但当她投来一个足以致命的眼神时，笑容立刻从他脸上消失了。随后，她继续吃她的三明治，这次边吃边继续说话。

"I did what you suggested, I went to the labs to get the stupid liquid analyzed, so they tell me they can't fit me in for another hour so I sit there waiting patiently. Then I get sent through and this perverted scientist keeps on staring at my breasts and even has the nerve to invite me out for dinner after it. This was a guy who at that moment had his hand wrist deep in some ones torso of course. God I hate people sometimes."  
"我照你说的做了，去实验室分析那该死的液体，结果他们告诉我还要再等一个小时，我只好耐心坐在那儿。然后我被叫进去，这个变态科学家一直盯着我胸部看，甚至还有胆子邀请我共进晚餐。要知道，当时他的手还深陷在某个人的胸腔里呢。天啊，有时候我真讨厌人。"

Shinji nodded, quite shocked at her outburst, he was just about to ask about the results when she continued.  
真嗣点点头，对她突如其来的爆发感到相当震惊，正要询问结果时，她继续说道。

"I decline and he just shrugs his shoulders and begins to analyze the liquid we found. I'm standing around for another hour waiting for him to run all these tests, every so often he makes this 'umm' and 'ahh' noises and keeps on saying 'hmm that's interesting' and do you know what he tells me at the end of it all, after all that?"  
"我拒绝了，他只是耸耸肩，开始分析我们找到的液体。我又站在那里等了一个小时，等他做完所有这些测试，时不时发出'嗯'和'啊'的声音，不停地念叨'嗯，真有意思'。你知道他最后告诉我什么吗，经历了这一切之后？""

"Umm no, what?" "呃，什么？"

"It's like blood… but it's not…"  
"像是血……但又不是……"

Shinji simply shook his head and looked over at her.  
真嗣只是摇了摇头，转头看向她。

"It's like blood… but it's not?"  
"像是血…但又不是？"

"Yes, so then I asked him to run it against the database of known species and the results found nothing. Of course that took another half an hour, I swear to god I could have ran those tests myself. I trained as a doctor, it's not exactly difficult."  
"是的，然后我让他用已知物种的数据库进行比对，结果什么都没找到。当然，这又花了半小时，我发誓我自己都能做这些测试。我受过医生训练，这真不算难。"

"I didn't know that…" "这我倒不知道…"

"Well you do now, so anyway that found nothing so I had wasted about two and a half hours of my life for no reason and then because I didn't take the car I had to walk home and as soon as I stepped out it started raining so now I'm wet, cold, hungry and pissed off."  
"好吧，你现在知道了，总之那次一无所获，我白白浪费了两个半小时的生命，毫无意义。而且因为我没开车，还得走路回家，一出门就开始下雨，现在我浑身湿透，又冷又饿，还一肚子火。"

Shinji nodded again, himself being quite angry that they were no nearer to solving the case than they were at the start of the day. He decided to turn over his findings to Asuka.  
真嗣再次点头，他自己也相当生气，因为他们离破案的进展并不比一天开始时更近。他决定把他的发现交给明日香。

"Well I looked up the name of our suspect 'Sachiel' to see it's meaning and to see if it had appeared in any other cases."  
"我查了我们嫌疑人的名字‘萨基尔’，想看看它的含义，以及是否在其他案件中出现过。"

"And..?" "然后呢？"

"I found nothing, although I do know that Sachiel is the name of the Angel of Water now so at least I've learnt something today."  
"我什么也没发现，不过现在我知道萨基尔是水之天使的名字了，至少今天学到了点东西。"

She sighed and looked over at him, she felt a bit better about her being unable to come up with anything, now that she knew Shinji had found nothing himself. She wondered why their suspect would choose a name like Sachiel, what would the Angel of Water have to do with this. Maybe it related to something else, there were three huge lakes nearby, maybe they would find something there.  
她叹了口气，转头看向他，得知真嗣也一无所获后，她感觉自己没找到线索的压力减轻了一些。她不明白他们的嫌疑人为何会选择萨基尔这样的名字，水之天使与此事有何关联。或许这与别的事物有关，附近有三座巨大的湖泊，也许在那里能找到什么线索。

"The lakes…" "那些湖泊……"

Shinji looked up from his computer.  
真嗣从电脑前抬起头来。

"Huh?" “啊？”

"You said Sachiel is the name for the Angel of Water didn't you?"  
"你说过萨基尔是水之天使的名字，对吧？"

"Yes, what about it?" "是的，怎么了？"

"Well if we're looking for an Angel of Water maybe the lakes on the outskirts of the city would be a good place to start."  
"如果我们正在寻找水之天使，也许城市郊外的湖泊会是个不错的起点。"

He looked over at her dumbly, how could he have not even thought of that?  
他茫然地看着她，他怎么就没想到这一点呢？

"Good idea" "好主意"

"Of course it's a good idea, it's one of mine."  
"当然是个好主意，这是我出的主意之一。"

He laughed and put away the folder containing the files collected on the case and prepared himself to go. He was beginning to warm up to the idea of having a partner, although he was still pretty sure that the department wouldn't last much longer after she filed her reports on him.  
他笑着把装有案件资料的文件夹收好，准备出发。他开始对有个搭档的想法感到有些兴趣，尽管他仍然相当确定，在她提交关于他的报告后，这个部门不会持续太久。

**Lakes – 1530 hours 湖泊 —— 1530 时**

The ongoing storm had picked up in ferocity as the two Agent's car pulled up. Shinji stepped out and took a look around, just as lightning flashed through the sky. He felt himself sinking into the mud around him and closed the car door, Asuka did the same and moved around to the same side. Off in the distance, the shadow of Tokyo-3 could be seen along with what seemed to be an endless stretch of forest.  
随着两位特工的车停下，这场持续的风暴愈发猛烈。真嗣下了车，环顾四周，恰逢一道闪电划破天际。他感到自己正陷入周围的泥泞中，随即关上车门，明日香也照做，绕到同一侧。远处，东京-3 的轮廓依稀可见，连绵不断的森林似乎无边无际。

The area they were in consisted of three lakes, each one surrounded by forest. During the summer it used to be a popular spot for families to go out to, however due to an incident two years ago when a group of people became sick with something from the water, the amount of people that came out had diminished. Now it was mostly avoided, except by teenagers out drinking and, or as Shinji suspected, cultists using the forests for their own cause.  
他们所在的地方由三个湖泊组成，每个湖泊都被森林环绕。夏天时，这里曾是家庭出游的热门地点，但由于两年前一群人因水中的某种物质而生病的事件，来此地的人数大减。如今，这里大多被避之不及，除了那些出来喝酒的青少年，或者如真嗣所怀疑的，被某些邪教徒用作森林中的活动场所。

Asuka felt herself shiver as she looked at the entrance to the first lake, a part of her wanted to be back in the office drinking coffee and discussing the case. The other part of her had a feeling that there was something here that they needed to see. She reached into her coat and pulled out her pistol, making sure it was loaded. She observed as Shinji did the same. They both stepped forward towards the gateway when something caught her eye.  
明日香看着第一个湖泊的入口，感到一阵寒意袭来。一部分的她渴望回到办公室，喝着咖啡讨论案件。而另一部分的她则有种预感，这里有些东西是他们必须看到的。她伸手进外套，掏出手枪，确认已装弹。她观察到真嗣也做了同样的动作。两人一同向入口迈进时，有什么东西吸引了她的目光。

"Shinji, come and take a look at this"  
“真嗣，过来看看这个。”

"What is it?" "什么事？"

They both made their way over to what she had noticed and peered down at it. Sections of the grass had been burnt away but it was not in any random formation, instead it appeared to be some sort of downward pointing triangle split in half. On the left half were what appeared to be three eyes, and on the right hand side four eyes. Each side positioned in a column formation. Shinji pulled out a small digital camera and took a photo of the formation. He then turned to Asuka.  
他们一起走向她注意到的地方，仔细观察。草地的一部分被烧毁，但并非随意形成，而是一个向下指的三角形被分成两半。左半边似乎有三只眼睛，右半边则是四只眼睛。每一边都呈列队排列。真嗣拿出一个小型数码相机，拍下了这个图案。随后，他转向明日香。

"Recognize it?" "认出来了吗？"

"Not at all, you're the expert for this sort of thing."  
"完全没印象，这方面你是专家。"

"I'll scan it in and see if I can find anything that matches it, but I've never seen anything like this before, looks like you were correct though, there is something here."  
"我会扫描一下，看看有没有匹配的资料，但我之前从未见过类似的东西，看来你是对的，这里确实有些什么。"

"Of course I was correct, did you expect anything less?"  
"当然我是对的，你还能期待什么别的吗？"

"We'd better move on then."  
"那我们最好继续前进。"

Shinji stood up and looked at the path leading through the forest, he easily climbed over the gate and Asuka followed suit. They entered the main public pathway and were shielded slightly from the rain by the towering trees around them. Unfortunately, this also meant it was slightly darker and harder to see. Shinji pulled a small torch from the inside of his jacket and aimed it at the ground in front of them.  
真嗣站起身来，望着穿过森林的小径，他轻松地翻过栅栏，明日香也紧随其后。他们进入了主要的公共步道，周围高耸的树木稍稍为他们挡住了雨水。不过，这也意味着这里稍微暗一些，视线更难。真嗣从夹克内侧掏出一个小手电筒，照亮了他们前方的地面。

"It's unusually dark for this time of the year, isn't it?"  
"这个季节这个时候通常不会这么暗，对吧？"

Asuka wasn't too sure if Shinji meant anything by saying this or if he was just making a random comment.  
明日香不太确定真嗣这么说是否有深意，还是只是随口一说。

"I guess so, maybe that's the mother ship blocking out the sun."  
"我想也是，可能是母舰挡住了阳光吧。"

Shinji stopped and shook his head, he also had to admit he was feeling slightly hurt by her reply. Just as he had thought she was beginning to slightly understand him and the cases he worked on, she had gone and made a comment like that. He made the further mistake of trying to apologize.  
真嗣停下脚步，摇了摇头，他也不得不承认，她的回答让他感到有些受伤。就在他以为她开始稍微理解他和他的工作时，她却说了那样的话。他更进一步的错误是试图道歉。

"Sorry, I was just saying."  
“对不起，我只是随口说说。”

Asuka recognized the hurt in his voice and looked down at the ground, she didn't mean to upset him. She was supposed to be a professional and she didn't want to have him hate her.  
明日香听出了他声音中的伤感，低头看着地面，她并非有意让他难过。她本应保持专业，不希望他因此而讨厌她。

"Don't apologize, you didn't do anything, I'm sorry for making the comment."  
"别道歉，你没做错什么，我为那句话道歉。"

They both resumed walking through the forest, the further in they got the darker it became. After a while, Asuka pulled out her torch and also began to hold onto her gun a bit tighter. After a few more minutes of walking they came across a section where the path split into two.  
他们继续在森林中前行，越往深处走，四周越显昏暗。过了一会儿，明日香拿出手电筒，同时也更紧地握住了枪。又走了几分钟后，他们遇到了一个岔路口。

"Guess we'll have to split up, I'll take the Eastern Lake, you take the Western, we'll meet back here in twenty minutes."  
"看来我们得分头行动了，我去东边的湖，你去西边的，二十分钟后在这里汇合。"

"Sounds good to me." “听起来不错。”

Asuka watched how Shinji put his pistol back in its holster and headed towards the Eastern Lake. She wondered if he was still a bit angry at her joke earlier. She was about to head towards the western lake when her cellphone went off. She pulled it out of her jacket pocket and looked at the caller ID.  
明日香看着真嗣将手枪放回枪套，朝东湖走去。她想知道他是否还在为之前她的玩笑生气。她正要朝西湖走去，手机却响了起来。她从夹克口袋里掏出手机，看了看来电显示。

'_Unrecognized Number… strange.'_  
“未知号码……奇怪。”

She accepted the call and put the phone to her ear, just as she was about to speak into it a high pitched noise from all around her cut her off. Her torch began to flicker and the cell phone switched itself off and on repeatedly. After a few more moments of this everything returned to normal, leaving Asuka wondering just what had just happened.  
她接起电话，将手机贴近耳边，正要开口时，四周突然传来一阵尖锐的噪音，打断了她。手电筒的光开始闪烁，手机也反复自动开关。又过了几秒钟，一切恢复正常，留下明日香疑惑刚刚究竟发生了什么。

'_Maybe Shinji is on to something with these theories of his…"_  
'也许真嗣的那些理论还真有点道理……'

**Eastern Lake 东湖**

Shinji felt himself trembling as he made his way towards the lake, although it wasn't with fear. He was trembling with anger and maybe a hint of sadness, he couldn't explain why but Asuka's comment earlier had hurt him. It wasn't as if he wasn't used to people speaking about him as if he was a joke, but when Asuka had said that it seemed to hurt a little more than usual.  
真嗣走向湖边的路上感到自己在颤抖，尽管并非出于恐惧。他是因愤怒而颤抖，或许还夹杂着一丝悲伤，他无法解释为何，但明日香之前的评论确实刺痛了他。虽然他早已习惯别人把他当作笑柄，但明日香的话似乎比平时更让他感到痛楚。

_I didn't ask for her to be put here, she doesn't need to act like that.  
我没要求她来这里，她没必要那样表现。_

Shinji had been contemplating retiring from NERV, even though he had only been there for a few years. He knew it was only a matter of time before the higher ups at NERV closed his section down and when that was done he had no other reason to be there, he could leave and get a job elsewhere, somewhere where he wasn't, as he saw it, a walking joke.  
真嗣一直在考虑从 NERV 退休，尽管他只在那里待了几年。他知道，NERV 高层关闭他所在部门只是时间问题，一旦如此，他便没有理由再留在那里。他可以离开，去别处找份工作，一个不会让他觉得自己像个行走的笑话的地方。

He continued walking through the forest until he eventually found himself at the lake, he looked out across the vastness of the water when he noticed something strange towards the center. It was as if there was a glow emanating from the center of the lake. There was no way he could make it out to the center of the lake, he pulled out his camera and tried to take a picture of the glow, however every image he took just appeared to be messed up, almost as if someone had burnt a hole through them.  
他继续穿越森林，最终发现自己来到了湖边。他眺望着水面的辽阔，忽然注意到湖中心有些异样。仿佛有一束光芒从湖心散发出来。他无法抵达湖中心，于是掏出相机试图拍下那束光芒，然而每张照片都显得混乱不堪，仿佛被烧穿了一个洞。

Moving around to an old pier, he noticed something lying on the ground, he kneeled down to examine it further and noticed it was a shred of clothing. He picked the shred up and put it in a plastic bag he had with him for collecting evidence, however when he looked out among the lake again he noticed that the glow from the center had began moving towards him. He stepped backwards slowly and drew out his pistol, ready for whatever it was that was approaching him. As the glow got closer, a man began to step out of the lake, he didn't appear to be much older then Shinji, maybe around his mid thirties. The man had jet black hair and was of a fairly muscular build. Shinji aimed his pistol directly at where the man's heart was as he continued walking towards him.  
他走到一个旧码头附近，注意到地上有东西，便蹲下仔细查看，发现是一块布料。他捡起布料，放入随身携带的塑料袋中准备收集证据，然而当他再次望向湖面时，发现中心的光芒开始向他移动。他慢慢后退，拔出手枪，准备应对即将到来的未知。随着光芒逼近，一个男人从湖中走出，看起来并不比真嗣大多少，大约三十五六岁。那人有着乌黑的头发，身材相当健壮。真嗣将手枪直接对准男人的心脏位置，而男人继续向他走来。

"Stop right where you are, I'm a NERV Agent."  
“立刻停下，我是 NERV 特工。”

The person stopped and smiled at him.  
那人停下脚步，朝他微笑。

"So you're the person they have doing their dirty work for them?"  
"所以你就是他们用来干脏活的那个人？"

"Who are you and what are you talking about?"  
"你是谁，你在说什么？"

"My name is not important although you will probably know me as Sachiel and I am the third."  
"我的名字并不重要，虽然你可能会知道我叫萨基尔，我是第三个。"

"The third what? I don't understand."  
"第三个什么？我不明白。"

"So you don't know what I am? The Committee won't be happy someone else has encountered me then. I guess I should save them the hassle of killing you then."  
"这么说你不知道我是什么人？委员会要是知道还有其他人遇到我，可不会高兴。我想我还是省了他们杀你的麻烦吧。"

"Move one step and I'll shoot."  
"动一步我就开枪。"

The person known as Sachiel simply laughed and stepped forward, almost immediately Shinji fired two shots directly at him. He stepped back in shock as a barrier of light appeared straight in front of Sachiel and the bullets simply ricocheted to the ground.  
被称为萨基尔的那个人只是笑了笑，然后向前迈了一步，几乎就在同时，真嗣直接向他开了两枪。他震惊地后退，一道光芒屏障突然出现在萨基尔面前，子弹只是反弹到了地上。

"What… What are you?" “什…你是什么？”

"I am the third, and what you just saw was known as my A.T. Field…"  
“我是第三使徒，你刚才看到的是被称为我的 A.T.力场…”

"A.T. Field?" "A.T. 力场？"

Sachiel opened his mouth to speak again when out of nowhere a gunshot fired again except this time it went directly through his A.T. Field and into his arm.  
萨基尔张嘴正要再次说话，突然间不知从何处又传来一声枪响，但这次子弹直接穿透了他的 A.T.力场，射入了他的手臂。

"Wha... That's impossible."  
"什...这不可能。"

Shinji looked to his right to see who his savior was and then he saw her. She emerged from the cover of the trees and fired two more shots into Sachiel, sending him falling back. Shinji took this moment to get a good look at the girl, she appeared to be about his age and was wearing a plain white latex body suit of some form. Shinji also noticed that the girl had unusually pale skin and blue hair, there was also something else about the girl's face he couldn't quite place. He continued watching as Sachiel fell to his knees and looked up at the girl with a smile on his face and blood trickling down from his mouth.  
真嗣向右看去，想知道是谁救了他，然后他看到了她。她从树丛中现身，又向萨基尔开了两枪，使他后退倒下。真嗣趁机仔细打量了这位女孩，她看起来和他年纪相仿，身穿一件朴素的白色乳胶紧身衣。真嗣还注意到，女孩的皮肤异常苍白，头发是蓝色的，她的脸上还有某种他无法确切描述的特征。他继续观察，只见萨基尔跪倒在地，抬头看着女孩，脸上带着微笑，嘴角流下一缕鲜血。

"So, you're what they sent after me."  
“所以，你就是他们派来对付我的。”

The girl spoke softly before firing a final shot into Sachiel's forehead.  
女孩轻声说道，随后向萨基尔的额头射出了最后一枪。

"Goodbye." “再见。”

Shinji stepped forward out of the forest he was in and approached the blue haired girl.  
真嗣从他所在的森林中向前迈出一步，走向那位蓝发女孩。

"Who… Who are you?" “你……你是谁？”

"I cannot tell you that, I am sorry."  
“我不能告诉你，很抱歉。”

"Sorry what for?" "对不起，为什么？"

"This." "这个。"

The girl brought out a strange looking device and plunged it directly into Shinji's chest. An Immense Pain shot through his body as he collapsed to the floor. The last thing he remembered seeing were several men in masks and white coats bearing the same 7 eyed logo he saw earlier, kneeling down next to him.  
女孩拿出一个奇怪的装置，直接插入了真嗣的胸口。一股剧痛瞬间贯穿他的身体，他倒在地上。他最后看到的景象是几个戴着面具、身穿白大褂的男人，胸前印着之前见过的七眼标志，跪在他身边。

**Western Lake 西湖**

Asuka put her cell phone back into her pocket and resumed her course to the western lake disturbed by what had just happened. As she walked, she began to think about what Shinji had said earlier about her being sent to check up on him. She wondered how he could have come up with such a thing, considering she was a new recruit and it was definitely not her intention to get him pushed out.  
明日香将手机放回口袋，继续向西湖走去，心中仍因刚刚发生的事而烦扰。她边走边思考真嗣之前说的话，关于她被派来监视他的事。她不明白他怎么会这么想，毕竟她是个新来的，绝没有要赶他走的意思。

'_What an idiot for saying such a thing, I may not agree with him but I'm not going to try to get the area shut down. I'm just going to show how good of a job I can do so I can be out of there as soon as possible. At least he's better than the last person I had to work with and no where near as perverted.'_  
"“说这种话真是蠢，我虽然不同意他的观点，但也没打算让这个地方关门。我只是想展示我能做得多好，尽快离开那里。至少他比上一个我不得不共事的人要好，也没那么变态。”

She finally reached the lake and looked around using her torch to examine the area around her. Moving around to the edge of the lake, something briefly caught her eye, it was what appeared to be a child's backpack. She knelt down beside it to take a closer look at the contents. Inside were various drawings done by children, around eighteen in total. Half of them had a drawing of a strange looking beast on them and others had the words Sachiel written on them.  
她终于抵达了湖边，用手电筒环顾四周。走到湖畔，有什么东西一闪而过，那似乎是一个孩子的背包。她跪在旁边仔细查看里面的内容。里面装着孩子们的各种画作，总共有十八幅。其中一半画着一只模样奇特的野兽，而其他的则写着“萨奇尔”这个名字。

She was about to collect them for evidence when she heard gunfire ring out from the eastern lake. She immediately leapt to her feet and muttered to herself before running off towards the lake.  
她正准备收集这些作为证据，突然听到东边湖畔传来枪声。她立刻跳起身，喃喃自语后便朝湖边跑去。

'_Guess I was right about this place'._  
'看来我对这个地方的猜测没错。'

Five more gunshots rang out and then complete silence as she found herself back in the clearing her and Shinji had split up in. She drew out her pistol and then headed towards the source of the shots, she had barely taken three steps when a huge blinding light covered her. She looked up at the source of the light and straight into the search light of a black helicopter.  
又是五声枪响，随后是一片死寂，她发现自己回到了与真嗣分开的空地上。她拔出手枪，朝着枪声的来源走去，刚迈出三步，一道巨大的强光便笼罩了她。她抬头望向光源，直直地对上了黑色直升机的探照灯。

'_What the hell?'_ '搞什么鬼？'

The chopper hovered over her for a few moments before setting off towards the eastern lake as well. Immediately, Asuka began sprinting towards the lake, wondering what the chopper was doing and what had just occurred.  
直升机在她头顶盘旋了几分钟后，也朝着东边的湖飞去。立刻，明日香开始向湖边狂奔，心中疑惑那架直升机在做什么，以及刚刚究竟发生了什么。

When she arrived at the lake she found the area was abandoned, there was no sign of anyone or anything. No Shinji, no helicopter and no one firing any weapons. She clutched her pistol a bit tighter and withdrew her flashlight again, scanning the area. She was about to give up when she noticed her flashlight bouncing off of something in the grass, she slowly made her way towards it and noticed it was Shinji's NERV ID and it appeared to be covered in the same liquid they had found at the Itou residence earlier.  
当她到达湖边时，发现这片区域空无一人，没有任何生命迹象。没有真嗣，没有直升机，也没有人开火。她更紧地握住手枪，再次取出电筒，扫视四周。正准备放弃时，她注意到电筒的光线在草丛中反射出什么东西，她缓缓靠近，发现那是真嗣的 NERV 身份卡，而且似乎被他们在伊藤家发现的同种液体覆盖着。

Her heart began to pound in her body as she pulled out her cell phone to try to contact Shinji. She pressed the speed dial she had set up earlier in the day and waited for the phone to begin ringing.  
她的心跳开始在体内加速，她掏出手机试图联系真嗣。按下白天设置好的快速拨号，等待电话开始响铃。

"_The phone you have called is currently switched off, please try again later."_  
“您拨打的电话已关机，请稍后再试。”

'_What the hell, he had it on when we came out here. Where the hell is he and what just happened out here?'_  
“见鬼了，我们出来时他还戴着呢。他到底跑哪儿去了，这里刚刚发生了什么？”

Asuka checked her watch to see the time and noticed something peculiar about the time. When they had came out here it was half three in the afternoon but according to her watch it was now half seven at night.  
明日香看了看手表确认时间，却发现时间有些古怪。他们出来时是下午三点半，但根据她的手表显示，现在已经是晚上七点半了。

'_Stupid thing, technological enhancements my ass'_  
“这破玩意儿，还技术增强呢，屁用没有。”

She checked her cell phone for the time but noticed it said exactly the same thing.  
她查看了一下手机上的时间，却发现显示的内容与之前完全一致。

'_This is getting stupid, no way can that much time have passed'_  
'这越来越荒唐了，不可能有那么多时间流逝的'

Asuka picked up Shinji's ID card and put it in her pocket, but not before taking another sample of the red liquid to ensure it was the same as that found earlier. She then decided to give the lake another sweep before heading back to NERV to see if Shinji had somehow made his way back.  
明日香拿起真嗣的身份证，放入口袋，但在那之前，她又取了一份红色液体的样本，确保与之前发现的相同。随后，她决定再次对湖泊进行搜索，然后返回 NERV，看看真嗣是否已经自行返回。

**Offices – 2000 hours 办公室 – 2000 小时**

When Asuka arrived back at the Office the first thing she noticed was that the entire office had been ransacked. She quickly dashed over to Shinji's desk and noticed all the case files they had been studying earlier were scattered around the desk and also on the floor. Looking through them she saw that none of them were missing, she then looked towards the folder they were using for the current case only to notice it had vanished from the desk.  
当明日香回到办公室时，她首先注意到的是整个办公室被洗劫一空。她迅速冲向真嗣的桌子，发现他们之前研究的案件文件散落在桌子和地板上。她翻阅了一下，发现没有丢失任何文件，然后她看向他们正在使用的案件文件夹，却发现它已经从桌上消失了。

She dashed over to her own desk and switched her computer on, trying to find the files she had saved earlier, holding the lab results. She logged on and went to the folder she had the results saved in only to find every single file on the system had been corrupted. She slammed her fist down on the desk in frustration as every single thing in the case they had found or worked out had been lost in the space of half an hour. The fact that her partner had suddenly vanished only added to the anger.  
她冲到自己的桌子前，打开电脑，试图找到她之前保存的实验室结果文件。她登录后进入保存结果的文件夹，却发现系统中的每一个文件都已被损坏。她沮丧地一拳砸在桌子上，他们在案件中发现或推断出的每一件事都在半小时内丢失了。她的搭档突然消失的事实更是火上浇油。

Just as she was about to pick up the phone to call the deputy director to report Shinji's disappearance and the sudden ransacking of the office the phone on Shinji's desk began to ring. Asuka carefully walked over to it and scanned the caller ID only to see it was an Unknown ID. She picked up the phone and a man's voice could be heard on the other end, it sounded as if the other person was using some sort of masking to hide his real voice.  
正当她准备拿起电话向副导演报告真嗣失踪和办公室突遭洗劫的情况时，真嗣桌上的电话开始响了起来。明日香小心翼翼地走过去，查看来电显示，却发现是一个未知号码。她接起电话，另一端传来一个男人的声音，听起来对方似乎使用了某种变声器来隐藏真实声音。

"_Agent Sohryu is that you?"_  
“草薙特工，是你吗？”

"Yes, who is this?" “是的，你是谁？”

"_I cannot tell you that, however what I can tell you is I have some information you might find useful."_  
"我不能告诉你那个，但我可以告诉你的是，我有一些你可能觉得有用的信息。"

"I'm not in the mood to play games, tell me who you are or I'm hanging up."  
"我没心情玩游戏，告诉我你是谁，否则我就挂电话了。"

"_Now now Asuka, I'm sure the sudden death of your working partner wouldn't look too good for your first day on the job now would it."_  
"好了好了，明日香，我相信你工作伙伴的突然死亡对你上班第一天来说不会太好看，对吧。"

"What do you know about Agent Ikari and my job?"  
"你对伊卡里特工和我的工作了解多少？"

"_I know quite a lot about you both, more importantly I know where he is being held but I need you to do me a favor."_  
"我对你们俩都相当了解，更重要的是，我知道他被关在哪里，但我需要你帮我一个忙。"

"I don't have time for this, tell me what you know."  
"我没时间扯这些，告诉我你知道的。"

"_He is being held in a location on the outskirts of time by people you don't want to get involved with. I can get you in there if you agree to my terms."_  
"他被囚禁在时间边缘的一个地点，那些人是你不想牵扯进去的。如果你同意我的条件，我可以带你进去。"

"And what terms would those be?"  
"那这些条件是什么呢？"

"_Inside the building he is in there is an item I need you to take, it's a diskette. I need you to take it and leave it outside the building when you exit."_  
"在他所在的建筑里有一个我需要你拿的东西，是一个软盘。我需要你把它拿出来，在你离开建筑时放在外面。"

"And why should I do this?"  
"我为什么要这么做？"

"_You want your partner to live don't you?"_  
"你不是希望你的伙伴活下去吗？"

"Why should I trust you?"  
"我凭什么相信你？"

"_You shouldn't trust anyone Asuka, but at this moment in time you have no choice. The details of where he is being held are in your top desk drawer, along with the keycard you will need to enter the complex. However, the keycard will only activate when you agree to my terms."_  
"你不应该信任任何人，明日香，但在此时此刻，你没有选择。他被关押的详细信息在你的办公桌最上面的抽屉里，还有你需要进入大楼的门禁卡。不过，门禁卡只有在同意我的条件后才会激活。"

"Ok then, where is the disk?"  
"那么，磁盘在哪里？"

"_It will be where Shinji is."_  
"它会在碇真嗣所在的地方。"

"What do you me…?" "你什么意…？"

A click was heard on the other end of the line as Asuka was cut off from the unknown person. She wandered over to her desk again and opened the top drawer, revealing a plain brown envelope, she opened the envelope and took out the contents, a map to a facility just out of the city and a keycard with her photo on it.  
电话那头传来一声轻响，未知的人切断了与明日香的联系。她再次踱步到桌前，打开最上层的抽屉，里面是一个普通的棕色信封，她打开信封，取出里面的东西：一张城市外某设施的地图和一张印有她照片的门禁卡。

'_What the… how was he able to get this?'_  
“这……他是怎么弄到这些的？”

**Unknown Location – Office – 2100 hours  
未知地点 – 办公室 – 21:00**

"The second is on her way now, she is under the illusion that the item she has to take will be of some use."  
“第二个已经在路上了，她误以为她要拿的东西会有点用处。”

"Good work, now onto other matters, is the first secured?"  
“干得好，现在说说其他事情，第一个已经安全了吗？”

"Yes he is, but are you sure you want to go through with this, Ikari? He is your own son after all."  
"是的，但他，你确定要这么做吗，碇？他毕竟是你的亲生儿子。"

The man who had just been asked looked directly ahead, from behind his folded hands, a hint of a smile could be seen creeping onto his face.  
刚刚被问到的男人直视前方，双手交叠在背后，一丝微笑悄然爬上他的脸庞。

"We have already been through this Fuyutsuki, they have been chosen by the Committee, our job is just to inject them and that will be all."  
"我们已经讨论过这个问题了，冬月，他们已被委员会选中，我们的任务只是给他们注射，仅此而已。"

"That will be all? Gendo, he is your son, you have seen the effect of the serum on the others, do you really want to agree to this?"  
"这样就可以了吗？源堂，他是你的儿子，你已经看到了血清对其他人的影响，你真的想同意这件事吗？"

"My decision has already been made, send in Dr .Akagi."  
"我的决定已经做出了，让赤木博士进来。"

"Yes, Sir." "是，长官。"

Fuyutsuki tapped a button on Gendo's desk, a few moments later a blonde woman in a white lab coat entered the room carrying a clipboard.  
冬月在碇的桌子上按了一个按钮，片刻后，一位金发女子身着白色实验服，手持剪贴板走进了房间。

"Dr. Akagi, how are the preparations going?"  
“赤木博士，准备工作进展如何？”

"We are ready to inject him with the serum now, we have made modifications to the serums used on him and the other female test subject. They will not be capable of producing an A.T. Field, they will however be able to neutralize them when within a range.  
“我们现在就可以给他注射血清了，我们对用于他和另一位女性测试对象的血清进行了修改。他们将无法产生 A.T.力场，但在一定范围内能够中和这些力场。”

"Good, that is all that is required, inform me when both have been injected."  
"很好，这就是全部所需，当两者都被注射后通知我。"

"Yes, Sir." "是的，先生。"

She immediately turned around and headed back out the door, leaving the office in semi darkness once again.  
她立刻转身，走出门外，办公室再次陷入半暗之中。

**Unknown Location – Entrance – 2100 hours  
未知地点 – 入口 – 2100 时**

Asuka sighed heavily as she pulled up outside the facility, she stepped out of the car and looked around making sure no one had followed her. She quickly moved towards the entrance holding the ID she had been sent tightly. To her surprise she was greeted by a Doctor in a White Labcoat outside the facility.  
明日香重重地叹了口气，她将车停在了设施外，下车环顾四周，确保没有人跟踪她。她迅速走向入口，紧握着收到的 ID。令她惊讶的是，一位身穿白大褂的医生在设施外迎接她。

"You must be Agent Sohryu, I take it you received the documents?"  
“您一定是惣流特工吧，想必您已经收到文件了？”

"Uhh, yes." "呃，是的。"

"We were expecting you, sorry about the secrecy but with this being a military facility we have to make sure we can trust people."  
"我们一直在等你，抱歉保密了这么久，但既然这是军事设施，我们必须确保能信任来人。"

"Right, so where is Agent Ikari?"  
"好的，那么碇指挥官在哪里？"

"He is currently recovering, we were lucky we found him when we did, you see the area you were both in was home to a rather deadly strain of virus that was accidentally let out. You might have noticed the symbol we left outside, which quite simply was a marker telling us where to look."  
"他目前正在康复中，我们很幸运及时找到了他。你知道吗，你们俩所在的区域原本藏有一种相当致命的病毒，这病毒是不小心被释放出来的。你可能注意到了我们在外面留下的符号，那其实是一个标记，告诉我们该从哪里开始搜寻。"

"A virus?" "病毒？"

"I cannot say anything else, but everything has been sorted out now, unfortunately we are going to have to inject you with a vaccine against this virus before we let you near Shinji. He has already been vaccinated but he is very weak at the moment, so exposure to it might cause a relapse."  
"我不能再透露更多了，但现在已经全部处理妥当。遗憾的是，在我们让你接近真嗣之前，必须给你注射针对这种病毒的疫苗。他已经接种了疫苗，但目前非常虚弱，再次接触病毒可能会导致复发。"

The doctor led Asuka into the facility and towards a small room in one of the corridors, she withdrew a needle and motioned for Asuka to take her jacket off. Asuka wondered just what sort of place this was and what type of virus the doctor was talking about.  
医生领着明日香走进设施，朝走廊中的一间小房间走去，她取出一支针筒，示意明日香脱下外套。明日香不禁疑惑，这究竟是个什么样的地方，医生所说的病毒又是什么。

"What type of place is this?"  
“这是什么地方？”

"This is a research lab funded by the government, we are researching cures to different diseases."  
“这是政府资助的研究实验室，我们正在研究不同疾病的疗法。”

"We were investigating something near those lakes, you don't know anything about the name Sachiel do you."  
"我们在那些湖附近调查一些事情，你不知道萨基尔这个名字吧？"

Asuka watched the doctor as she began to prepare the injection, it was at that moment she could have sworn she saw a hint of recognition in the Doctors eyes at the mention of the name Sachiel. The Doctor quickly injected Asuka and then replied.  
明日香注视着医生开始准备注射，就在那一刻，她几乎可以发誓，在提到萨基尔这个名字时，医生的眼中闪过一丝认识的神色。医生迅速给明日香注射完毕，然后回答道。

"No, never heard of it, anyway I'm finished, now I can show you to Agent Ikari."  
"没有，从未听说过，总之我完成了，现在我可以带你去见碇特工了。"

"Thanks." "谢谢。"

She led her down a few more corridors into another room where she saw Shinji sitting up in a bed, looking down at the floor. As she entered Shinji looked over at her and smiled.  
她又领着她穿过几条走廊，进入另一个房间，她看到真嗣坐在床上，低头看着地板。当她走进来时，真嗣抬头看向她，微笑了一下。

"They told me about the virus and everything, sorry if I scared you out there by disappearing so suddenly."  
“他们告诉我关于病毒和所有的事情，抱歉如果我突然消失吓到你了。”

"Its fine, what happened? I heard gunshots."  
“没事，发生了什么？我听到了枪声。”

"That was me, I thought I saw something but they said the virus makes you hallucinate. They said I was lucky I didn't turn the gun on myself."  
"那是我，我以为我看到了什么，但他们说病毒会让你产生幻觉。他们说我运气好，没把枪对准自己。"

Asuka studied him carefully as he spoke, there was something about the way he said this. His eyes showed deep sadness and the words seemed a little too rehearsed.  
明日香仔细地听着他说话，他这样说话的方式有些特别。他的眼神流露出深深的悲伤，而那些话听起来似乎有些过于熟练。

"So you didn't see anything?"  
"所以你什么也没看到？"

"Nothing." "没什么。"

'_Bullshit'_ '胡说八道'

"Agent Sohryu…" "碇君…"

"Yes." "是的。"

"Can we go now? I'm not really a big fan of hospitals."  
"我们现在可以走了吗？我不是很喜欢医院。"

"Sure." "当然。"

Shinji stood up and walked over to the doorway, Asuka was about to follow him when she noticed something on the table near him, it was a small diskette. she looked around ensuring there were no cameras or other people and quickly picked up the disk and put it into her pocket. Just as she did so she noticed Shinji still standing at the doorway leaning against it slightly and looking very pale.  
真嗣站起身，走向门口，明日香正要跟随他时，注意到他旁边的桌子上有什么东西，那是一个小小的软盘。她环顾四周，确保没有摄像头或其他人在场，迅速捡起软盘放入口袋。就在这时，她发现真嗣还站在门口，微微倚靠着门框，脸色异常苍白。

"Are you sure you're alright?"  
“你确定你没事吗？”

"Yes, let's just go." “是的，我们走吧。”

'_Something happened to him and he's not telling me anything'_  
'他发生了些事，却不肯告诉我任何细节'

### Chapter 3 No Stone Unturned

_April 19th 2015 2015 年 4 月 19 日_

**Basement Offices – 0930 hours  
地下办公室 – 上午 0930 时**

It had been a week since what had became known as the Sachiel incident, much to Asuka's amazement both her and Shinji had been credited with solving the case. All the bodies of the children had been recovered at the lakes along with the body of the man calling himself Sachiel. It was revealed that the man was a forty three year old Caucasian male whose identity had not been revealed. Shinji had not spoken to Asuka about the case, except to clear up details of what happened before they went to the lakes and when Asuka picked him up from the medical facility later that night. As far as Asuka was concerned that time they were at the lakes may as well have not happened for Shinji as he had not spoke about it at all, even when she asked.  
自称为萨基尔的事件发生已有一周，令明日香惊讶的是，她和真嗣都被归功于解决了这起案件。所有孩子的尸体都在湖边被找到，连同自称萨基尔的男子的尸体。经查明，该男子是一名四十三岁的白人男性，其身份尚未公开。真嗣除了澄清他们在前往湖边之前以及明日香那晚从医疗设施接他时发生的事情细节外，并未与明日香谈论此案。对明日香而言，他们在湖边的那段时间对真嗣来说仿佛不存在，因为他对此只字未提，即便她询问也是如此。

The other thing which struck Asuka as bizarre was how when she returned to the office the next day there was no trace at all of the break in, it was almost as if it never happened. When she enquired about it there appeared to be no evidence of a break in but also the vial of liquid she took from the scene had also vanished, she was told that the entire thing might have been due to being under the influence of the virus at the lakes. It was an explanation she did not buy one bit but she had nothing to prove otherwise. The diskette she had taken from the facility had also vanished without a trace, leaving her with nothing to put into her report of the case except the basics of the course, such as how they were able to find the note then go onto the lakes and the events since then.  
让明日香感到匪夷所思的另一件事是，当她第二天回到办公室时，那里竟然没有丝毫闯入的痕迹，仿佛一切从未发生过。当她询问此事时，似乎没有任何闯入的证据，而且她从现场拿走的那瓶液体也消失了，她被告知这一切可能是因为她在湖边感染了病毒。这个解释她一点儿也不相信，但她没有任何证据来反驳。她从设施中拿走的那张软盘也消失得无影无踪，让她除了案件的基本经过外，无法在报告中添加任何实质内容，比如他们是如何找到那张纸条，然后前往湖边以及之后发生的一系列事件。

Still, she was happy she had been commended and she was also, in a way, happy for Shinji that the department would live on another day. She felt a sense of pride as she waited for the elevator to go down to the office. The elevator came to a halt and the doors opened revealing the corridor to the office. She strode down and came to the door and went to open it only to find it was locked.  
尽管如此，她还是很高兴自己受到了表扬，而且从某种程度上说，她也为真嗣感到高兴，因为部门又能多撑一天了。她带着一种自豪感等待电梯下到办公室。电梯停了下来，门打开，露出了通往办公室的走廊。她大步走过去，来到门前，正要开门，却发现门锁着。

'_That idiot has remembered I work here too hasn't he?'_  
'那个白痴终于记起我也在这里工作了，对吧？'

She knocked on the door and waited for a response, only to receive nothing at all. She sighed impatiently and knocked again once again, receiving no response. Her morning happiness quickly turning to slight anger, she delved into her pockets and pulled out the key to the office. Quickly slamming it into the keyhole she turned the key and opened the door and stepped into the office.  
她敲了敲门，等待回应，却毫无动静。她不耐烦地叹了口气，再次敲门，依旧无人应答。早晨的愉悦迅速转为些许怒意，她伸手从口袋里掏出办公室的钥匙。迅速将钥匙插入锁孔，转动钥匙，推开门，踏进了办公室。

'_Oh great, the idiot isn't here, and he told me he had something important to show me as well.'_  
'哦，太好了，那个白痴不在，他还跟我说有重要的事情要给我看呢。'

Asuka went to sit down at her desk when she noticed the light on Shinji's answering machine flashing. Curiosity got the better of her as the casually walked over to the machine and pressed the play button. Immediately Shinji's voice began to play over the machine.  
明日香走到桌前坐下，注意到真嗣的答录机上的指示灯在闪烁。好奇心驱使她随意地走过去按下了播放键。随即，真嗣的声音从机器中传了出来。

"_Hello Asuka, sorry I'm not there at the moment but I've already had to leave. I'm at the thing I wanted to show you, meet me at the park over by the northern subway station, there's someone I'd like to introduce you to as well."_  
“你好，明日香，抱歉我现在不在，但我已经不得不离开了。我在我想给你看的地方，到北地铁站附近的公园来找我吧，我还想介绍一个人给你认识。”

Asuka felt her anger rise as Shinji's message played, after all it had only been half an hour since he had told her to meet him urgently in the office and now he was asking her to go all the way across town. She walked over to her desk and put her jacket back on before muttering to herself.  
明日香听着真嗣的留言，怒火中烧，毕竟就在半小时前他还急切地让她去办公室见面，现在却让她大老远跑到城那边去。她走到桌前重新穿上外套，嘴里嘟囔着。

'_Stupid idiot making me go all the way across town, this had better be something interesting.'_  
‘这个蠢货让我大老远跑遍全城，最好是有趣的东西。’

**Northern District – 0945 hours  
北区 – 0945 时**

Shinji awaited the arrival of Asuka by the entrance to the park gates, he had been careful not to reveal to Asuka exactly what he had to show her as the circumstances were too bizarre to be put into words. He was unsure of how Asuka was going to react to it. Despite them having to have worked together for just over a week now and all the times they had to speak to their superiors about what had happened he still didn't know what to make of the red headed woman. He was grateful to her for helping him out and also giving the department another chance to stay around but he felt bad about not telling her what had happened a week ago.  
真嗣在公园门口等待着明日香的到來，他小心翼翼地没有向明日香透露他要展示给她的具体内容，因为情况太过离奇，难以用言语表达。他不确定明日香会有什么反应。尽管他们已经合作了一个多星期，而且多次与上级讨论发生的事情，他仍然无法理解这位红发女子。他感激她帮助他，也给部门带来了继续存在的机会，但他对自己一周前发生的事情没有告诉她感到内疚。

'_She already thinks I'm crazy, if I start telling her about what I saw then I don't even want to know what'll happen. Besides, it's no use telling her, it's not like she'll believe me.'_  
“她已经觉得我疯了，如果我开始告诉她我所看到的东西，我甚至不想知道会发生什么。再说了，告诉她也没用，她不可能相信我的。”

He sighed as he saw Asuka's car pull up in front of him and he readied himself for Asuka's barrage when she exited the car. Another thing he had quickly learnt about her was that she seemed to have a very short temper and one wrong word seemed to set her off. Still, what he had to show her was incredibly important and related to the department so this shouldn't annoy her too much.  
当他看到明日香的车停在他面前时，他叹了口气，准备好迎接她下车后的连珠炮。他很快就了解到，她似乎脾气很暴躁，一句话说错就能让她发火。尽管如此，他必须向她展示的东西极其重要，与部门有关，这应该不会让她太生气。

Asuka stepped out of the car and looked around, the first thing she saw was Shinji looking over at the car, behind him were various police officers walking around as well as another woman in a suit similar to hers, who she didn't recognize. Oddly enough, she noticed police tape surrounding a huge boulder and a crane standing nearby. She walked over to Shinji with a confused look on her face.  
明日香走出车外，环顾四周，首先看到的是真嗣朝车子这边看过来，他身后有各种警察走来走去，还有一个穿着和她相似西装的女人，她不认识。奇怪的是，她注意到警戒线围着一块巨大的岩石，旁边还停着一台起重机。她带着困惑的表情走向真嗣。

"What's going on?" "发生了什么事？"

"I think you need to see for yourself but there's someone I'd like to introduce you to first."  
"我觉得你得亲眼看看，不过在此之前，我想先介绍一个人给你认识。"

The two agents entered the park and walked over to the police tape and quickly ducked under it after showing the officer guarding it their NERV ID's. Immediately after they ducked under it the woman in the suit looked over at them and quickly moved towards them.  
两名特工进入公园，走向警戒线，向守在那里的警官出示了 NERV 的身份证后迅速弯腰钻过。他们刚一钻过，那位身穿西装的女士便朝他们望来，并迅速向他们走来。

"Agent Sohryu, I presume?"  
"想必您就是索留香特工吧？"

Asuka was now able to look at the woman a bit better. The first thing that stood out about her was the fact that she had purple hair, the second was that she appeared to have a NERV ID, however Asuka could not make out the details on it.  
现在，明日香能更清楚地观察这位女士了。首先引人注目的是她那一头紫发，其次则是她似乎佩戴着 NERV 的 ID 卡，但明日香无法看清上面的细节。

"Yeah that's right, and you are?"  
"没错，我就是。那您是哪位？"

"Director of Operations Misato Katsuragi, I've just been assigned to the Tokyo-3 branch of NERV."  
"作战部长葛城美里小姐，我刚刚被调派到 NERV 东京-3 分部。"

"I see, so how come you're out on the field?"  
"明白了，那你为何会在现场呢？"

"I'm here unofficially actually, I used to know Shinji when he was younger and was his guardian when his uncle died up until the point he entered the NERV Academy."  
"实际上我是非正式来的，我以前认识真嗣，在他叔叔去世后直到他进入 NERV 学院之前，我一直担任他的监护人。"

"Oh, I see." "哦，我明白了。"

Shinji blushed slightly as Misato explained to Asuka about how she came to be his guardian. It had come as quite a surprise to Shinji when he learnt that Misato would in effect be his new boss, he had known her for near enough thirteen years, however they had not been in contact with each other for at least four years. Misato had always been good to him and she was pretty much the closest thing he had to a mother since his own had died.  
当美里向明日香解释她如何成为真嗣的监护人时，真嗣的脸微微泛红。当得知美里实际上将成为他的新上司时，真嗣感到非常惊讶，尽管他们相识近十三年，但至少有四年没有联系了。美里一直对他很好，自从他母亲去世后，她几乎是他最亲近的母亲般的存在。

She also seemed to be the only person who didn't abandon him, not for lack of Shinji trying. When she took him in after his uncle died he had tried all he could to get away, even running away once but she had always been there for him. He never quite understood why but he assumed it had something to do with Misato's own upbringing, when she was young she lost both her parents in the Second Impact incident and was the only survivor of that fateful event. She was twenty one at the time and the incident left her unable to have children of her own. He watched as a police officer went up to the two women and interrupted their conversation.  
她似乎也是唯一一个没有抛弃他的人，并非真嗣没有尝试过。在她收留他之后，他的叔叔去世了，他尽一切可能想要离开，甚至逃跑过一次，但她总是陪伴在他身边。他始终不太明白为什么，但他猜想这与美里自己的成长经历有关，她在年轻时在第二次冲击事件中失去了双亲，是那场灾难中唯一的幸存者。当时她二十一岁，那次事件使她失去了生育自己孩子的能力。他看着一名警察走向两位女士，打断了她们的对话。

"Miss Katsuragi, we're ready to begin now."  
"桂崎小姐，我们现在可以开始了。"

"Ok, good." "好的，很好。"

The three of them ducked back out under the police tape and watched as the crane began moving in towards the huge boulder. As it did so Asuka turned to Shinji, wondering what was going on.  
他们三人再次弯腰穿过警戒线，看着起重机开始向巨大的岩石移动。在此过程中，明日香转向真嗣，想知道发生了什么。

"What is this all about, you didn't drag me out her to meet your old guardian did you?"  
"这是怎么回事，你不会是把我拉到这里来见你的老监护人吧？"

"No, wait and see." "不，等着看吧。"

All three of them looked on as the crane picked up the boulder and lifted it up off of the ground, as it did so Asuka's stomach lurched as she saw something dropping off the bottom. She looked up and noticed the entire bottom of the boulder was stained with blood. She turned to look at Shinji and noticed he had gone slightly pale at the gruesome scene in front of them. The crane settled the boulder down in a location next to it as the three agents ducked back under the police tape towards the scene.  
他们三人注视着那只鹤举起巨石，将其从地面升起，就在这时，明日香感到胃里一阵翻腾，因为她看到有什么东西从底部掉了下来。她抬头一看，发现巨石的整个底部都沾满了血迹。她转头看向真嗣，注意到他在眼前这恐怖的景象下脸色变得有些苍白。起重机将巨石安置在旁边的一个位置，三位特工弯腰从警戒线下方返回现场。

The three of them drew their heads back at the sight of the scene in front of them, to say it was gruesome would be an understatement. Directly under where the boulder had landed was what could only be described as human road kill. The body they saw was bloodied, squashed and destroyed. Asuka had trained in a medical school briefly before coming to NERV so she was used to the sight of blood and guts, but this was nothing like she had seen, it was almost as if this boulder had landed on top of this guy from a very great height.  
三人见到眼前的景象，都不禁倒抽一口凉气，若说这场景惨不忍睹，那简直是轻描淡写。巨石落下的正下方，只能用“人肉路障”来形容。他们所见的尸体血肉模糊，压得稀烂，面目全非。明日香曾在医学院短暂学习过，来到 NERV 之前也见惯了血肉模糊的场面，但这次完全不同，仿佛这块巨石是从极高处直接砸在这人身上。

"That's disgusting." “太恶心了。”

"I agree, so what are your thoughts Agent Sohryu?"  
“我同意，那么，你有什么看法，碇司令？”

"Well clearly this guy has been, for lack of a better word, squished between the ground and that boulder that was removed. For this to have happened the boulder would have had to have fallen from quite a height. Of course there's nothing around this immediate area that will have led to this so I'm assuming the use of a crane but surely someone would have noticed that."  
"显然，这个家伙，找不到更好的词来形容，被夹在了地面和那块被移走的巨石之间。要发生这种情况，巨石肯定是从相当高的地方掉下来的。当然，这附近没有任何东西会导致这种情况，所以我猜是用了起重机，但肯定有人会注意到这一点。"

Shinji merely nodded. 真嗣只是点了点头。

"Looks like it, but to get this crane in we had to cut through an area of the fencing so that rules out that possibility. The other thing is that the boulder was originally over there."  
"看起来是这样，但要动用起重机，我们不得不剪断一部分围栏，这就排除了那种可能性。另一个问题是，那块巨石原本是在那边的。"

He pointed to another area of the park, in that area were eight boulders set up in a circle each one similar to the one that had just been lifted away, Asuka spotted that one of the boulders was missing.  
他指向公园的另一区域，那里有八块巨石围成一圈，每块都与刚刚被移走的那块相似，明日香注意到其中一块巨石不见了。

"So the boulder we just saw lifted came from over there?"  
“所以我们刚才看到被移走的那块石头是从那边来的？”

"That's right." "是的。"

Asuka looked from the circular set up back to Shinji, who seemed to be equally as confused as she was. She then turned to Misato who just merely shrugged.  
明日香从那圈巨石看回真嗣，他似乎和她一样困惑。她随后转向美里，后者只是耸了耸肩。

"Ok, so what do you think it is Agent Ikari, and don't tell me you think it was the Jolly Green Giant either."  
"好吧，那么你认为是什么，碇君？别告诉我你也认为是那棵快乐的绿巨人。"

Shinji looked at her blankly and spoke.  
真嗣茫然地看着她，开口说道。

"Who?" "谁？"

"Never mind." "算了。"

"Well we found his wallet near to the scene, he is forty four years of age and is a Patrick Anderson. An American immigrant whose name is not unknown to NERV, his name frequently pops up with regards to mob involvement. Tokyo 3 police have been watching him for quite some time, gathering evidence on him, it is their belief he was in the park last night to cut some sort of deal but the details are unknown."  
"我们在案发现场附近找到了他的钱包，他四十四岁，名叫帕特里克·安德森。一个美国移民，他的名字对 NERV 来说并不陌生，经常与黑帮活动有关。东京 3 的警方已经监视他很长时间了，一直在收集他的犯罪证据，他们认为他昨晚在公园是为了进行某种交易，但具体细节尚不清楚。"

"So what, do you think the other people turned on him and killed him?"  
"那么，你认为其他人背叛了他并杀了他吗？"

"It's possible, unfortunately the good police officers watching him decided that the moment of his death would be a good time to nip out for more coffee so they were unable to see anything and no other witnesses have came forward, we do however have details on who he was scheduled to meet."  
"有可能，不幸的是，那些监视他的好警察们认为他死的那一刻是出去买更多咖啡的好时机，所以他们什么也没看到，也没有其他目击者站出来，不过我们确实有他预定要见的人的详细信息。"

"That still doesn't explain how the boulder got from there to here."  
"那还是没解释这块巨石是怎么从那儿到这儿的。"

"I think that maybe he pissed off the person he was dealing with and this was their way of revenge."  
"我觉得可能是他惹恼了交易对象，这是对方的报复方式。"

"What, so one person picked up a boulder and throws it at him? That's impossible."  
"什么，一个人搬起巨石扔向他？那不可能。"

"Well, in the past many have tried experiments with things like telekinesis, it's not too farfetched to suggest that whoever done this harnessed some sort of telekinetic power."  
"好吧，过去许多人尝试过心灵感应之类的实验，提出做这件事的人可能掌握了某种心灵传动能力，并不算太牵强。"

Asuka slapped her forehead and looked at him scathingly.  
明日香拍了拍额头，用鄙夷的目光看着他。

"So you're suggesting we're going after someone who can move objects with his mind?"  
"所以你是说，我们要去追捕一个能用意念移动物体的人？"

Shinji locked eyes with her and instantly began to question what he had just said, it wasn't that he didn't believe it. It's just the way Asuka had simply questioned it made him lose all confidence in what he had just said.  
真嗣与她对视，立刻开始怀疑自己刚才所说的话，并非他不相信。只是明日香如此简单地质疑，让他瞬间失去了对自己所言的所有信心。

"Well no, I was just… never mind. We should probably question the person he was scheduled to meet. I'll be over at the car making the arrangements, you two do whatever you want to do."  
“呃，不，我只是……算了。我们或许应该调查一下他原本要见的人。我去车上安排一下，你们俩随意。”

Asuka and Misato watched as Shinji quickly walked away from the scene and back towards the car. Asuka immediately recognized that she had sapped the young mans confidence and was angered by the fact that Shinji backed down so easily.  
明日香和美里看着真嗣迅速离开现场，朝车子走去。明日香立刻意识到自己削弱了少年的信心，对真嗣如此轻易退缩感到愤怒。

'_Idiot, if he's going to say something he needs to be more forceful and not give up so easily, although the idea did sound stupid.'_  
'傻瓜，如果他要说什么，就得更有力些，别这么轻易放弃，虽然那主意听起来确实挺蠢的。'

"I see you two are getting on well."  
'我看你们俩相处得不错。'

"I don't understand him, he's got a reputation for having all these strange ideas and concepts yet whenever he's mentioned one in the past two cases we've worked on he just backs down straight away when questioned about it. It's almost as if he just doesn't want to have me here."  
'我不懂他，他以这些奇怪的想法和概念著称，可每当我们一起处理过的那两起案件中提到这些时，他一被质疑就立刻退缩了。简直像是不想让我在这儿似的。'

"I'll be honest with you Agent Sohryu, he doesn't."  
"说实话，草薙特工，他并没有。"

"Did he tell you that?"  
"他这么跟你说的吗？"

"No but I was his guardian when he was fourteen and he's always been like that, he doesn't like having people around him and you questioning him like that doesn't help."  
"没有，但他十四岁时我是他的监护人，他一直就是这样，不喜欢身边有人，你那样质问他只会适得其反。"

"I'm not trying to upset him it's just his ideas are a bit too farfetched, I mean telekinesis and such, they don't even exist."  
"我并不是想让他难过，只是他的想法有点太离谱了，比如心灵感应之类的，那些根本就不存在。"

"To him they do, there's a reason why he believes what he does, but it's not my place to tell you, it's his."  
"对他来说，这些是存在的。他之所以相信这些，是有原因的，但我无权告诉你，这是他的秘密。"

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"Shinji is the way he is because of his past, he has things there he hasn't come to terms with yet, this lead to his strange beliefs. The fact that people within the agency ridicule him for it doesn't help."  
"真嗣之所以这样，是因为他的过去，他在那里有些事情还没能接受，这导致了他那些奇怪的信仰。机构里的人因此嘲笑他，这并没有帮助。"

"Do you believe any of what he believes?"  
"你相信他所说的任何一点吗？"

"You mean about aliens and the paranormal?"  
"你是说关于外星人和超自然现象的事？"

"Yes." "是的。"

Misato thought about the question for a few moments before replying flatly.  
美里对这个问题的思考持续了几分钟，然后平淡地回答。

"No."

"I see, so what do you think happened here then?"  
"我明白了，那你觉得这里发生了什么？"

"I don't know, but I have confidence that you and Shinji will be able to figure it out."  
"我不清楚，但我相信你和真嗣一定能找出答案。"

Asuka looked over to the corpse on the ground and then back over to Shinji, who was sitting in the car resting on the dashboard. The conversation with Misato had only worsened her view of Shinji, she wondered how someone like him could have been in NERV for so long when they were unable to really put forward anything or at least work with other people. She then cast her mind back to everything that had happened in the past week, the entire incident with the medical facility and Shinji's reaction to her since then. She was meant to be his working partner yet he had told her nothing about what had happened.  
明日香瞥了一眼地上的尸体，然后转向坐在车里靠在仪表盘上的真嗣。与美里的一番对话只是加深了她对真嗣的看法，她不明白像他这样的人怎么能在 NERV 待这么久，却连一点实质性的贡献都做不出来，甚至连与他人合作都做不到。她随后回想起过去一周发生的所有事情，包括医疗设施事件和真嗣自那以后对她的反应。她本应是他的工作伙伴，但他却对她隐瞒了所有事情。

'_How pathetic'_ “多么可悲”

"Who was he supposed to meet with?"  
“他应该和谁见面？”

"A Ken Mizushima, he runs a small betting shop near here I believe."  
“一个叫水岛健的人，我记得他在附近经营一家小赌场。”

"I think we will be taking a trip there now then."  
"我想我们现在就要去那里一趟了。"

"Good luck." "祝你好运。"

**Mizushima's Betting Store – 1030 hours  
水岛赌场 – 上午 10 点 30 分**

A hive, that's how Asuka would have described the place. A hive of addicts and criminals, she wondered how such a place could exist within a city like Tokyo 3. Along the walls various fruit machines spun in unison as their scruffy players eagerly tried to win the main prize. In the far corner, a group was huddled around a TV willing on horses to try and win, then groaning when they lost.  
一个蜂巢，这就是明日香会形容这个地方的方式。一个瘾君子和罪犯的蜂巢，她不禁好奇，这样的地方是如何在东京 3 这样的城市中存在的。沿着墙壁，各种水果机同步旋转，它们邋遢的玩家急切地试图赢得大奖。在远处的角落里，一群人围在电视机前，为赛马加油，然后当他们输掉时发出叹息。

'_I doubt these guys would notice if it was a recording'_  
'我怀疑这些人会不会注意到那是个录像'

Towards the back there was a counter where a guy in a suit sat, naturally he sat behind protective glass just in case one of the people within the store decided to go insane. Both Asuka and Shinji quickly made note of the various men in suits scattered around the store, keeping a close eye on the addicted gamblers. It couldn't be any more obvious to both Agents that this was just a front for the mob, yet for some reason the people within it were still allowed to work. It was exploitation at its finest and unfortunately for the people involved it was all legal.  
在后面有一个柜台，一个穿着西装的家伙坐在那里，自然地，他坐在防弹玻璃后面，以防店里的某个人发疯。明日香和真嗣很快就注意到了店里散布着的各个穿着西装的男人，他们密切监视着沉迷赌博的人。对于两位特工来说，这显然是黑帮的一个幌子，但不知为何，里面的人仍然被允许工作。这是最纯粹的剥削，不幸的是，对涉及其中的人来说，这一切都是合法的。

They quickly made there way up to the counter and Asuka leaned over to speak to the person behind it.  
他们迅速走向柜台，明日香俯身向柜台后的人说话。

"I'm looking for Ken Mizushima."  
“我在找 Ken Mizushima。”

"The Boss? A lot of people are looking for him, who in particular is looking."  
“老板？很多人都在找他，具体是谁在找呢？”

Asuka brandished her ID at the person sitting behind the counter.  
明日香挥舞着她的身份证，对着坐在柜台后面的人说道。

"Agent Sohryu of NERV, I'm investigating a case in which an acquaintance of his was murdered, we just want to ask a few questions."  
“NERV 特工惣流，我正在调查一桩他熟人被谋杀的案件，我们只是想问几个问题。”

"NERV, eh? He was expecting you, go straight up the stairs, it's the first room on the right."  
“NERV 啊？他正等着你呢，直接上楼梯，右边第一个房间就是。”

Shinji glanced over at Asuka as the man spoke, a warning signal went off in his mind. It was too easy, no one tried to turn them away or come up with any excuse. Maybe it was a trap, he waited until they were into the stairwell before making his feelings known.  
真嗣一边听着那人说话，一边瞥向明日香，心中警铃大作。这一切太过顺利，没有人试图阻止他们或找任何借口。或许这是个陷阱，他等到他们进入楼梯间后才表达了自己的疑虑。

"Agent Sohryu, hold on a moment."  
“草薙特工，稍等一下。”

"What is it?" "什么事？"

"Don't you think that was a bit too easy?"  
“你不觉得这有点太容易了吗？”

"Yes I do, but I don't think they'd be stupid enough to try to spring a trap. Let's just be careful."  
"是的，我知道，但我想他们不会愚蠢到试图设下陷阱。我们还是小心为妙。"

"Agreed." "同意。"

They both cautiously climbed the stairs and entered the corridor the man at the desk had told them to. The two of them slowly approached the door and paused for a moment outside. Lightly Shinji tapped on the door.  
他们俩都小心翼翼地爬上楼梯，进入了前台男子告诉他们的走廊。两人缓缓接近那扇门，在门外停顿了一会儿。轻轻地，真嗣敲了敲门。

"Mr. Mizushima?" "水岛先生？"

There was no response, Shinji and Asuka looked each other both with a confused expression on their faces.  
没有回应，真嗣和明日香面面相觑，脸上都带着困惑的表情。

"I thought he was expecting us?"  
"我以为他在等我们？"

"Guess we thought wrong."  
"看来我们想错了。"

Asuka now knocked on the door a bit louder this time.  
这次，明日香敲门的声音更大了些。

"Mr. Mizushima open up, we're NERV Agents."  
"水岛先生，请开门，我们是 NERV 的特工。"

Again there was no response, Shinji was getting slightly impatient and he could sense Asuka was feeling the same. Suddenly a thought occurred to them both, maybe this was a trap except not in the way they thought.  
再次没有回应，真嗣感到有些不耐烦，他也能感觉到明日香同样如此。突然间，他们两人同时想到一个念头，也许这是一个陷阱，只不过并非他们所想的那种。

"You don't think?" “你不会是觉得？”

"Oh for crying out loud, that must be the oldest trick in the book."  
“哦，拜托，这肯定是书上最老套的伎俩了。”

The two of them quickly darted from the door and back down the stairs into the main area of the store. They took a quick look around only to find that the person who had told them where to go was still sitting there except now he was reading a newspaper and smoking a cigarette, not dashing out of the store towards freedom as both Agents expected. Shinji made his way over to him this time hoping to get better results.  
两人迅速从门口闪回，沿着楼梯下到商店的主要区域。他们快速环顾四周，却发现告诉他们去向的那个人依旧坐在那里，只是现在他正读着报纸，抽着香烟，并没有像两位特工预想的那样冲出商店奔向自由。这次，真嗣径直走向他，希望能得到更好的结果。

"Where is your boss?" “你们老板在哪儿？”

"I just told you he's in his office and was expecting you guys, he even wrote it down look."  
“我刚告诉过你，他在办公室，而且正等着你们呢，他甚至还写下来了，看。”

The man brandished a piece of paper with some scruffy handwriting on it. Shinji studied the writing and read what it said.  
那男人挥舞着一张字迹潦草的纸条。真嗣仔细端详着上面的字迹，读出了内容。

'_NERV will be sending someone here, when they arrive send them up, I have something important to tell them.'_  
'NERV 会派人来这里，他们到了就请他们上来，我有重要的事情要告诉他们。'

Shinji folded the note up and put it in his pocket before speaking again.  
真嗣将纸条折好放入口袋，然后再次开口。

"Well he wasn't in there and his door was locked."  
"嗯，他不在里面，而且他的门是锁着的。"

The man got up from his chair and pulled a set of keys out of his pocket he made his way out of the counter area and made sure it was locked securely.  
那人从椅子上站起来，从口袋里掏出一串钥匙，他走出柜台区域，确保门被锁得严严实实。

"Hold on a minute I'll take you guys up there."  
"稍等一下，我带你们上去。"

The man lead them back up into the corridor and towards the same door, he inserted one of the keys into the door and opened it, allowing them all access to the room.  
那人领着他们回到走廊，走向同一扇门，他将其中一把钥匙插入锁孔并打开门，让他们所有人得以进入房间。

"Boss, those NERV Agents you were expecting have arr…"  
“老大，您等的那几位 NERV 特工已经到了……”

His sentence dropped off as he saw the state of the room, all around the floor were various bills and receipts. Most of them stained with blood, on the right hand wall a safe had been opened and various notes were scattered around the floor. The two agents entered the room and looked around, the window had been opened widely, obviously an escape route. Asuka broke the silence.  
他的话音未落，便被房间内的景象打断。地板上散落着各种账单和收据，大多沾染了血迹。右侧墙上，一个保险箱已被打开，各种纸条散落一地。两名特工进入房间，环顾四周，窗户大开，显然是条逃生通道。明日香打破了沉默。

"What happened here?" "这里发生了什么？"

"It looks like there's been some sort of struggle, how long has your boss been here and has anyone else been in here since he arrived."  
"看起来像是发生了某种争执，你的老板在这里多久了，他来之后还有其他人进来过吗？"

"He arrived ten minutes before you did and was the only person besides me with access. The windows open from the inside and I've been downstairs all morning, we even have the CCTV footage to prove it."  
"他比你早到十分钟，除了我之外，他是唯一有进入权限的人。窗户是从里面打开的，我整个上午都在楼下，我们甚至有监控录像可以证明。"

"Where could your boss be now then?"  
"你的老板现在会在哪儿呢？"

"I have no id… holy shit."  
"我没有 ID……我靠。"

Both agents watched as the guys face turned very pale all of a sudden, they both quickly noticed why as they saw what had caught his eye. A drop of blood trickled down as they saw the body of Ken Mizushima had been effectively nailed to the ceiling. The missing notes from the safe had been stapled all over his torso and legs and knives of different varieties kept him held in place. Shinji turned to the man who had lead them up here and questioned him a bit more.  
两名特工看着那人的脸色突然变得煞白，他们立刻意识到原因，因为他所看到的东西。一滴血缓缓流下，他们看到 Ken Mizushima 的尸体被牢牢钉在天花板上。保险箱里丢失的文件被钉满他的胸膛和双腿，各种刀具将他固定在原位。Shinji 转向带他们上来的那个人，进一步质问。

"Has your Boss mentioned anything about anyone being after him?"  
"你老板有没有提过有人盯上他？"

"No, although he did look slightly nervous this morning."  
"没有，不过他今早看起来有点紧张。"

"Ok, this is what you're going to do, go downstairs and close up the store. We're going to look around a bit more here."  
"好，你这样，下楼去把店关了。我们在这儿再仔细看看。"

The man simply nodded and left the room, leaving Asuka and Shinji to digest what they were looking at.  
那男人只是点了点头，便离开了房间，留下明日香和真嗣消化他们所看到的一切。

"Guess Mizushima wasn't our guy then."  
“看来水岛不是我们要找的人。”

"Doesn't look like it, I'll call NERV and get them to send a team out here to recover the body. Look around the office see if he left a note or anything."  
“看起来不像，我给 NERV 打电话，让他们派个团队来这里回收尸体。检查一下办公室，看他有没有留下什么字条或东西。”

Asuka nodded, but before Shinji left she asked him a question.  
明日香点了点头，但在真嗣离开前，她向他提出了一个问题。

"Did you know Mizushima was going to be dead?"  
“你知道水岛会死吗？”

"I had a feeling he might have been, I think someone is after revenge against these people. I also think Mizushima was aware of it and what this person was capable of, he was probably a witness to what happened last night."  
“我有种感觉他可能会，我觉得有人在对这些人进行报复。我也认为水岛知道这一点以及这个人的能力，他可能昨晚目睹了发生的事情。”

"Then why didn't he say anything or call the police?"  
"那他为什么什么都没说，也没报警？"

"He was expecting us, maybe he knew it was inevitable or maybe there was something here he wanted to show us."  
"他可能在等我们，或许他知道这是不可避免的，或者这里有什么他想展示给我们的东西。"

"What could that be?" "那会是什么呢？"

"I don't know but I'm willing to bet it's inside this office."  
"我不知道，但我敢打赌它就在这间办公室里。"

Shinji stepped out of the room withdrawing his cell phone in the process. Asuka noticed immediately how he had acted with regards to this, everything he said had made sense and she had to admit she was thinking the same thing. It amazed her how he acted now compared to how she had seen him act before she remembered what Misato told her about how his past had affected the way he is and compared it to what the reports she had read on him had said. Even with Shinji's bizarre ideas he was still a highly competent agent and probably one of the best in Tokyo 3.  
真嗣走出房间，顺手拿出了他的手机。明日香立刻注意到他对此事的处理方式，他所说的一切都合情合理，她不得不承认自己也在思考同样的问题。她惊讶于他现在的表现与她记忆中他以前的行为相比，想起了美里告诉她他的过去如何影响了他现在的性格，并与她读过的关于他的报告进行了比较。尽管真嗣的想法有些古怪，但他仍然是一个非常能干的特工，很可能是东京 3 区最优秀的特工之一。

'_But still… telekinesis and aliens, it's all a bit stupid'_  
'但话说回来……心灵感应和外星人，这一切都有些愚蠢'

She made her way round to Mizushima's desk, making sure to avoid the general area around where the body hung. Immediately a letter with the title NERV caught her eye, she quickly flipped open the letter and read it quietly.  
她绕到水岛的桌子旁，小心翼翼地避开悬挂着尸体的周围区域。一封标题为“NERV”的信件立刻吸引了她的注意，她迅速打开信封，静静地阅读起来。

'_To whoever NERV sends,_ “致 NERV 派遣的任何人，”

_If you are reading this then I have died, probably the way I deserve to. We had no idea what we were getting ourselves into when we double crossed this man but now he has returned and is coming after us one by one. He has already taken out Anderson and now me. This guy… I have seen him do things that are supposed to be impossible, he can move objects without touching them I can't explain how but he can. His name is Hideo Kis…'  
“如果你在读这封信，那么我已经死了，或许这也是我应得的下场。当我们背叛这个人时，我们完全不知道自己卷入了什么。但现在他回来了，正一个接一个地追杀我们。他已经干掉了安德森，现在轮到我了。这家伙……我亲眼见过他做那些本应不可能的事，他能不触碰物体就移动它们，我无法解释他是怎么做到的，但他的确可以。他的名字是木村英……”_

Asuka cursed silently as the note cut off just before it revealed their prime suspects full name. She read over the letter again making notes of everything that was said, she stopped and read over the section about moving objects repeatedly.  
明日香暗自咒骂，那张纸条在揭露主要嫌疑人全名之前戛然而止。她再次仔细阅读信件，记录下所有提及的内容，当读到关于移动物体的部分时，她停了下来，反复琢磨。

'_Moving objects without touching them? He's referring to telekinesis, is everyone but me going insane around here?'_  
'不触碰就能移动物体？他指的是念动力，难道这里除了我之外所有人都疯了吗？'

She folded the not up and put it in her pocket, ready to leave the room when the door suddenly slammed shut in front of her, this was closely followed by the windows slamming shut. She tried to force the door open but it was to no avail, then she looked towards the window, sure she was going insane. Directly on level with the window was another of the knives, the window opened again and she watched as the knife pointed directly at her.  
她将纸条折好放入口袋，正准备离开房间，突然门在她面前猛地关上，紧接着窗户也砰然关闭。她试图强行打开门，却徒劳无功，随后她看向窗户，确信自己快要疯了。与窗户平齐的地方又出现了一把刀，窗户再次打开，她眼睁睁看着那把刀直指向她。

'_This is impossible, this can't be happening'_  
“这不可能，这不该发生”

### Chapter 4 Running Shoes  
第四章 跑鞋

**Mizushima's Betting Store – 1040 hours  
水岛赌场 —— 10:40**

Shinji stepped out of the room, leaving Asuka to search the area. He pulled out his phone and made his way out into the stair well. He quickly dialed in Misato's number and waited for her to answer, as he waited he went over the case so far. Two dead bodies in the space of twenty four hours, it was obvious to Shinji that someone was out for revenge. Mizushima had been linked with several crime syndicates in and out of Tokyo 3, the other man who had been killed, the American, had also popped up and had been linked to several of the syndicates. It wouldn't surprise Shinji at all if the two deceased had crossed paths several times before.  
真嗣走出房间，留下明日香继续搜查。他掏出手机，走向楼梯间。迅速拨通了美里小姐的号码，等待她接听的同时，他回顾了迄今为止的案件。二十四小时内两具尸体，真嗣明显感觉到有人正在复仇。水岛与东京 3 内外多个犯罪集团有关联，另一位被杀的美国人也曾与多个犯罪集团有过牵扯。如果这两位死者生前多次相遇，真嗣一点也不会感到惊讶。

'_I'm sure there's something else going on here, the way they died, it's not normal, but Asuka doesn't believe me, I don't blame her but I'm sure I'm right, if only she could see it for herself maybe she'll believe me.'_  
'我确信这里还有其他事情发生，他们的死法不正常，但明日香不相信我，我不怪她，但我确信我是对的，如果她能亲眼看到，也许她会相信我。'

Shinji's thoughts were interrupted as Misato picked up on the other end.  
真嗣的思绪被电话那头的美里打断了。

"_Katsuragi here, what's going on Shinji?"_  
“我是葛城，真嗣，发生什么事了？”

"Hi Misato, we're at Mizushima's now."  
“嗨，美里，我们现在在水岛这里。”

"_I see, did he have anything to say?"_  
"我明白了，他有什么要说的吗？"

"If he has he didn't get a chance to say it, we found him dead in his office."  
"如果有，他也没机会说出口，我们发现他死在了办公室里。"

"_Dead? But how?"_

"We found him pinned to his office ceiling and his office had been ransacked, doesn't look like any money was taken."  
"我们发现他被钉在了办公室的天花板上，办公室被洗劫一空，看起来钱并没有被拿走。"

"_I see, I'll send a team down to retrieve the body, keep me posted on what's happening."_  
"明白了，我会派一支队伍下去回收遗体，随时向我汇报情况。"

"Sure th…"

A scream was heard from back in the corridor, Shinji immediately recognized it as Asuka's voice.  
走廊后方传来一声尖叫，真嗣立刻辨认出那是明日香的声音。

"Misato I have to go, get a team down here as soon as possible."  
"美里，我得走了，尽快派一支队伍到这里来。"

He quickly hung up and ran up the stairs towards Mizushima's office and the source of the screaming. He burst through the door just in time to see Asuka pinned up against the wall, hovering directly in front of her was a knife. Quickly he grabbed hold of her and pulled her out of the room, just as the knife flew at her face. She was just able to make it away in time as it slammed into the wall with a hefty thud.  
他迅速挂断电话，冲上楼梯，朝着水岛的办公室和尖叫声的源头奔去。他破门而入，正好看到明日香被按在墙上，一把刀悬在她面前。他迅速抓住她，将她拉出房间，就在刀子飞向她脸庞的那一刻。她及时逃脱，刀子重重地撞在墙上，发出沉闷的声响。

The two of them looked at each other, both with fear in their eyes, unsure whether or not to believe what they had just seen. Before any of them could get a chance to speak a shout was heard from outside the building, they quickly dashed back into the office and across to the open window, the man from earlier who had shown them up the room was standing in front of a hooded man, a knife aimed directly at him.  
两人面面相觑，眼中都流露出恐惧，不确定是否相信刚才所见。在他们有机会开口之前，外面传来一声喊叫，他们迅速冲回办公室，穿过房间来到敞开的窗户前，之前带他们上楼的那个人正站在一个蒙面人面前，一把刀直指着他。

"What… What is this, who the hell are you?"  
“这……这是什么，你到底是谁？”

The man lifted his hood back, he was bald but severely scarred, he lifted his head up showing something to Mizushima's employee, almost immediately the employee flinched backwards in fear. He dashed to the door trying to open it but it was too late as the knife was plunged straight through his throat. Shinji flinched as he watched the man get decapitated. Shinji quickly pulled out his pistol and ran out of the room down to the alleyway. Asuka also pulled out her gun and followed Shinji down.  
那人重新拉起兜帽，他虽秃顶却满布疤痕，抬头向水岛先生的员工展示着什么，员工几乎立刻因恐惧而后退。他冲向门试图打开，但为时已晚，刀刃直插喉咙。真嗣见那人被斩首，不禁一颤。他迅速拔出手枪，冲出房间，跑向小巷。明日香也拔出枪，紧随真嗣而去。

When they got outside into the small alleyway there was no trace of the man they had previously seen, they cautiously stepped into the alley and towards the street. Shinji noticed a hooded man running away and quickly bolted after him.  
当他们来到外面的小巷时，之前所见的那人已无踪迹，他们小心翼翼地步入小巷，走向街道。真嗣注意到一个戴兜帽的人正逃离，便迅速追了上去。

"Stay here and wait for Misato, I'm going to get some answers."  
“留在这里等美里，我要去弄清楚一些事情。”

"What do you mean? You just saw what he did…."  
"你什么意思？你刚刚看到他做了什么……"

Asuka called after him but it was no use, Shinji had already gotten far away and was unable to hear her anymore. Asuka cursed under her breath and looked around the alley, slightly unsettled at the sight of the body in front of her.  
明日香在他身后喊着，但无济于事，真嗣已经走远了，再也听不到她的声音。明日香低声咒骂，环顾小巷，看到眼前的尸体，心中略感不安。

**Streets of Tokyo 3 – 1050 hours  
第三东京市街道 —— 10 点 50 分**

Shinji had been chasing after the guy for what seemed like ages, through back alleys and across busy streets, he never seemed to tire. His heart was pounding in his body as he just ran trying in desperation to catch up with the guy. He made it to what must have been the twelfth alley when he noticed that he could no longer see the guy. Nervously taking a look around, he noticed he was in the docks area of the city.  
真嗣已经追着那个家伙跑了仿佛有好几年，穿过狭窄的后巷，跨越繁忙的街道，他似乎永远不会疲惫。他的心脏在胸腔里狂跳，他只是拼命奔跑，试图追上那个家伙。当他跑到第十二条巷子时，他注意到再也看不见那个家伙了。他紧张地环顾四周，发现自己来到了城市的码头区。

'_Shit, he could be in any of these warehouses around here'_  
“该死，他可能藏在这些仓库中的任何一个里”

He cautiously stepped out of the alley he was in and looked around and noticed a multitude of warehouses with their doors open and most bolted shut. A few of them had workers moving back and forth between large vans and trucks. He holstered his gun and walked over to one of the workers brandishing his NERV ID.  
他小心翼翼地走出所在的巷子，环顾四周，注意到许多仓库的门敞开着，大部分则紧锁着。其中几间仓库里，工人们在大货车和小卡车之间来回穿梭。他收起枪，走向其中一名工人，亮出自己的 NERV 身份识别卡。

"Excuse me, have you guys seen anyone running through here in the past five minutes."  
"劳驾，你们有没有看到谁在过去的五分钟里从这儿跑过去？"

The two workers looked at each other before responding to Shinji.  
两名工人相互对视了一眼，然后回答了真嗣。

"Nope, haven't seen anyone passing through here all morning. Then again we've been in the warehouse all morning."  
"没有，整个上午都没见到有人经过。不过话说回来，我们整个上午都在仓库里。"

"I see, well thanks anyway."  
"我明白了，不过还是谢谢你。"

He sighed and headed in the other direction, trying to find a sign of the guy. He could be hiding in any of these warehouses and it'd take forever to search each one intensely and by that time he could have moved on. To make matters worse, Shinji hadn't even gotten a good look at the guys face. They knew he was bald and severely scarred on the top of the head, but that wasn't enough to go on, he needed more. He crossed over the road ready to head back to Mizushima's office when his cell phone started ringing.  
他叹了口气，朝另一个方向走去，试图找到那个家伙的踪迹。他可能藏在这些仓库中的任何一个，要彻底搜查每一个仓库需要花费很长时间，而到那时他可能已经转移了。更糟糕的是，真嗣甚至没有好好看清那个人的脸。他们只知道他是个秃头，头顶上有严重的伤疤，但这远远不够，他需要更多的线索。他穿过马路，准备返回水岛的办公室，这时他的手机开始响了。

"Agent Ikari."

"_Shinji, where are you? Agent Sohryu has just told me what happened, what do you think you were doing chasing after him like that?"_  
"真嗣，你在哪儿？草薙特工刚刚告诉我发生了什么，你以为你在做什么，那样追着他跑？"

"Sorry."

"_Idiot, you could have been killed."_  
"傻瓜，你差点就没命了。"

"Sorry."

"_Where are you anyway?"_ "你现在在哪儿？"

"I chased him into the Docks District but lost him there."  
"我追他到了码头区，但那儿把他跟丢了。"

"_Stay where you are, I'm sending Agent Sohryu to pick you up, she found something in Mizushima's office relating to our guy."_  
"待在原地别动，我派草薙特工去接你，她在水岛的办公室发现了一些与我们目标相关的线索。"

"Yes"

"_And Shinji, one more thing, don't go chasing after this guy again, he's dangerous. I don't want you or Asuka going after him on your own, if you see him move away and inform me first."_  
"还有，真嗣，还有一件事，不要再独自追踪这个家伙了，他很危险。我不希望你或明日香单独去追他，如果看到他，立刻远离并先通知我。"

"Right..."

The phone went dead, leaving Shinji to contemplate the conversation he had just had with Misato. She sounded angry, it had been quite some time since he had heard her sound that angry at him, not since the first time he ran away from her when she adopted him.  
电话挂断了，留下真嗣沉思着刚刚与美里进行的对话。她的声音听起来很生气，他已经很久没有听到她对他如此生气了，那还是在他第一次从她那里逃跑的时候。

**Thirteen Years Ago - Docks District – 2300 hours  
十三年前 - 码头区 – 晚上 11 点**

He couldn't remember how long he had been running form, but it seemed like forever. Shinji crossed over a road and ducked into a nearby bus shelter, just as a flash of lightning tore through the sky. His clothes were completely soaked and the rainwater streamed down his face, disguising the tears which were also rolling down his face. Out of breath, he collapsed to the ground, his back pressed against the glass. He wiped his face with his hand and brought his knees up to his chest, trying to scrap some piece of warmth.  
他不记得自己跑了多久，但感觉像是永远。真嗣穿过一条马路，躲进附近的公交车站，就在这时一道闪电划破天空。他的衣服完全湿透了，雨水顺着脸颊流下，掩盖了同样滚落的泪水。他喘不过气来，瘫倒在地，背靠玻璃。他用手抹了抹脸，将膝盖抱到胸前，试图抓住一丝温暖。

The music from his SDAT Player cut out suddenly, leaving him with only the sound of the rain drops dripping on the Bus Shelters roof. Shinji looked down at his soaked shirt and trousers and spoke softly to himself.  
他的 SDAT 播放器音乐突然中断，只剩下雨滴落在公交车站顶上的声音。真嗣低头看着湿透的衬衫和裤子，轻声对自己说。

'_I'm pathetic'_

He looked around to see where he was, most of the street lights weren't working and the majority of the buildings were yet to be constructed. In the poor illumination he could make out the shadows of a group of youths on the other side of the road walking past. They were yelling and were clearly drunk. Two of them paused for a moment and Shinji eyes widened as the two started making out and groping each other as the others tried to get them to move on.  
他环顾四周，想知道自己身处何地，大多数路灯都坏了，大部分建筑还未建成。在微弱的照明下，他隐约看到对面马路上一群年轻人走过，他们大喊大叫，显然是喝醉了。其中两人停顿了一下，真嗣的眼睛瞪大了，那两人开始亲吻并互相摸索，其他人则试图让他们继续前行。

Shinji desperately tried to scrap together any warmth around him, he even contemplated going back.  
真嗣拼命地试图聚集身边的温暖，他甚至考虑过回去。

'_No… I'm not going back, she doesn't need or want someone like me around, I'm only in the way'_  
'不……我不回去，她不需要也不想要我这样的人在身边，我只会碍事'

It was strange but he couldn't even remember what had caused him to run away, there were no arguments and it wasn't that he didn't like Misato.  
这很奇怪，但他甚至记不清是什么原因让他逃跑的，没有争吵，也不是因为他不喜欢美里。

'_I'm just an inconvenience to her, it'll be better for her this way, bad things will happen if I go back.'_  
'我只是她的一个麻烦，这样对她更好，如果我回去，坏事就会发生。'

Shinji had only been staying at Misato's for a couple of weeks, she had pretty much adopted him after his uncle died a month ago. Shinji would rather she hadn't, he was scared that she would just abandon him like the others have. He then remembered what it was that caused him to run away. A dream about his mother, it was ten years ago and his mother was talking to him, he couldn't remember what it was about and then there was a light and the next thing he knew, she was gone. Then it was a few years later, he was at a gravestone, this time with his father, he couldn't remember who's name was on the stone. He looked away for a second and then his father had also gone.  
真嗣只在美里家住过几周，一个月前他的叔叔去世后，美里几乎收养了他。真嗣宁愿她没有这样做，他害怕她会像其他人一样抛弃他。然后他想起了导致他逃跑的原因。一个关于他母亲的梦，那是十年前的事了，母亲在和他说话，他不记得内容是什么，然后出现了一道光，接下来他知道的就是，她消失了。几年后，他在一块墓碑前，这次是和父亲一起，他不记得墓碑上是谁的名字。他转头一瞬，父亲也消失了。

The third scene he was with his uncle, Shinji had been staying with his uncle for a few years, however most of those years he had to pretty much bring himself up as his uncle was in and out of hospital and then the same thing again, his uncle vanishing before him. It was the fourth scene which led to it, and was probably the most disturbing thing about the dream. This time it wasn't a family member, it was Misato, only she was lying face down, Shinji couldn't remember precisely but he was sure she was slightly younger. He was in a ruined city, all the buildings had been destroyed and everyone had died. That was when he saw Misato lying face down on the floor.  
第三幕中，他与叔叔在一起，真嗣已经在叔叔家住了几年，但大部分时间里，他几乎得自己照顾自己，因为叔叔经常进出医院，然后又在他面前消失。导致这一切的是第四幕，这可能是梦境中最令人不安的部分。这次不是家人，而是美里，只是她脸朝下躺着，真嗣记不清具体细节，但他确信她看起来稍微年轻些。他身处一座废墟之城，所有建筑都被摧毁，所有人都已死去。就在那时，他看到美里脸朝下躺在地上。

A tear rolled down his face as the memories of the dream came flooding back to him, he couldn't let that happen to her. Everyone else he had been around had abandoned him or died, he wasn't going to let that happen to Misato, she had been nice to him, if he ran away now and was never heard from again it would save them a lot of pain in the future.  
泪水顺着他的脸颊滑落，梦境的记忆如潮水般涌回，他不能让这种事发生在她身上。他周围的其他人都抛弃了他或死去，他不会让美里也遭遇同样的事，她对他很好，如果他现在逃跑，从此销声匿迹，将来会为他们省去很多痛苦。

His eyelids began to feel heavy as the rain started coming through the roof of the bus shelter. Despite the dampness and the cold he felt an urge to just sleep, slowly his eyelids began to close as he drifted off.  
他的眼皮开始感到沉重，雨水透过公交车站的屋顶渗了进来。尽管潮湿和寒冷，他仍有一种强烈的睡意，慢慢地，他的眼皮开始合上，他陷入了沉睡。

'_Goodbye…. Misato…'_

**Present Day – Basement Offices – 1130 hours.  
今日 —— 地下办公室 —— 11 点 30 分。**

Eventful would be an accurate adjective for Asuka and Shinji to describe their morning so far. After all, it was not every day they would witness someone being murdered in the manner that they had seen. Asuka was furious at Shinji, first of all for running off and leaving her alone to deal with passers by and also to wait for back up from NERV and secondly for failing to even apprehend the suspect. They entered the office and Asuka threw her coat down over her seat and went straight to her computer. Shinji also went over to his desk, quite unsure of what to say to the angered woman.  
用“多事”来形容明日香和真嗣今早的经历再准确不过了。毕竟，不是每天都能目睹到那种方式的谋杀。明日香对真嗣怒不可遏，首先是因为他逃跑并留下她独自应对路人，还要等待 NERV 的支援，其次是因为他未能抓住嫌疑人。他们进入办公室，明日香把外套扔在座位上，直奔电脑而去。真嗣也走到自己的桌前，完全不知道该如何安抚这位愤怒的女性。

Maybe it was becoming a common theme, Shinji sat on one side unsure of what to say while Asuka sat angry and getting on with her work. Still, the last time they were in this situation they were able to solve the case, maybe they would have the same luck. Shinji decided it would be a good time to test this theory.  
或许这正逐渐成为一种常态，真嗣坐在一边，不知该说些什么，而明日香则气鼓鼓地继续她的工作。不过，上次他们处于这种境地时成功破解了案件，或许这次他们也能有同样的运气。真嗣觉得现在是检验这一理论的好时机。

"Misato said you found something relating to our suspect in Mizushima's office."  
“美里说你在水岛的办公室里发现了与我们嫌疑人相关的东西。”

She stared over and Shinji and glared a hole straight through him.  
她瞪了真嗣一眼，目光仿佛能直接将他洞穿。

"That's right." "是的。"

Asuka reached into her jacket pocket and pulled out the note she had found earlier in Mizushima's office, she put it on her desk and continued speaking.  
明日香伸手进夹克口袋，掏出之前在水岛办公室找到的那张纸条，放在桌上，继续说道。

"It was just before that whole knife incident, it's addressed to us. Mizushima began to write down the person's name, but was interrupted before he could finish it off."  
“就在那次刀具事件发生前不久，这封信是写给我们的。水岛开始写下那个人的名字，但还没写完就被打断了。”

Shinji got up and picked up the note, reading it over a few times. He made a mental note of the name 'Hideo.' He cursed silently when he realized there was no surname to go with it but it still gave them something to go on.  
真嗣站起身，拿起纸条反复读了几遍。他在心里记下了‘英二’这个名字。意识到没有姓氏与之对应时，他暗自咒骂，但至少这给了他们一些线索。

"So Agent Ikari, what was that that we saw at the crime scene?"  
"那么，碇警官，我们在犯罪现场看到的那是什么？"

"What do you mean?"  
"你什么意思？"

"You know what I mean, that guy he… you saw what he done, that was impossible."  
"你知道我的意思，那个家伙他……你看到了他做了什么，那是不可能的。"

"But you saw it didn't you?"  
"但你确实看到了，对吧？"

"Yes but how can someone do that?"  
"可是，人怎么能做到那种事呢？"

"I don't know, all I know is that it happened and we have to stop him before it happens again. If this note is correct then there are more people out there who this guy is going to kill, we have to find him before he kills again."  
"我不知道，我只知道这件事发生了，我们必须在他再次行动前阻止他。如果这张纸条准确无误，那么还有更多的人将会被他杀害，我们得在他再次杀人之前找到他。"

"We have his first name and a few letters of his surname but that doesn't give us much to go on. I can't just search through a list of everyone called 'Hideo' in Tokyo 3."  
"我们只知道他的名字是‘英二’，姓氏只知道几个字母，这线索太少了。我总不能在东京 3 区里一个个查叫‘英二’的人吧。"

Asuka had a point, they couldn't just go out looking for anyone called Hideo, however they did have something else to go on.  
明日香说得有道理，他们不能漫无目的地寻找名叫英夫的人，不过他们还有其他线索可以跟进。

"You're right, what if we limited it to people who own businesses in the Docks?"  
“你说得对，如果我们把范围缩小到在码头区经营生意的人呢？”

"We don't know that this guy does run a business though and why the Docks?"  
“我们并不确定这家伙是否真的经营着生意，而且为什么是码头区？”

"That's where he was able to slip away from me, maybe he has a business that operates out of there."  
"那就是他能够从我眼皮底下溜走的地方，也许他在那里有个生意据点。"

"Well no offence Agent Ikari, but you're not exactly the most athletic looking person, maybe you were just too slow."  
"好吧，伊卡里探员，无意冒犯，但你看起来确实不像是运动健将，也许只是你跑得太慢了。"

Shinji laughed for a bit.

"No he's definitely there, besides running's something I am at least good at."  
"不，他肯定在那里，再说了，跑步至少是我擅长的。"

**Thirteen Years Ago – Hospital Room – 0430 hours.  
十三年前 —— 医院病房 —— 凌晨四点半。**

The first thing Shinji saw when he woke up was an incredibly bright light, he struggled to open his eyes, wondering what had happened. He slowly came to and found himself staring up at a hospital room ceiling. Shinji wondered how he had got here, the last thing he remembered was falling unconscious in the bus shelter. The room was dimly lit, however in the far corner he could see Misato sleeping with her head slumped against a table.  
醒来时，真嗣首先看到的是一束极其刺眼的光，他费力地睁开眼睛，疑惑发生了什么。他渐渐恢复意识，发现自己正盯着医院病房的天花板。真嗣纳闷自己是怎么来到这里的，他最后记得的是在公交站台昏倒。房间光线昏暗，但在远处的角落里，他能看到美里头靠在桌子上睡着了。

He tried to grab more of the sheet trying to get some warmth, he sneezed violently waking Misato up in the process. He immediately shut his eyes pretending to be asleep as she got up and walked over to his bed. He felt her warm hand pressed against his forehead.  
他试图抓住更多的被子来获取一些温暖，却猛地打了个喷嚏，把美里吵醒了。他立刻闭上眼睛假装还在睡觉，而她起身走到他的床边。他感觉到她温暖的手掌贴在他的额头上。

"Shinji…"

Her voice was breaking up as she tried not to cry. She had spent half the night trying not to cry from the moment she realized he was gone to the moment she was told he had been found. It was amazing the effect he had on her even though it had only been a few weeks since she had adopted him.  
她的声音因强忍哭泣而变得断断续续。自从意识到他不见了，到被告知他被找到的那一刻，她几乎半宿都在努力不让自己哭出来。尽管她收养他才不过几周时间，他对她的影响却大得惊人。

"Shinji, why did you run away?"  
“真嗣，你为什么要逃跑？”

Shinji gave no response instead he just shut his eyes tighter, hoping Misato would think he was sleeping. She did no such thing however, instead she sat on the bed and put her arm over him.  
真嗣没有回答，反而闭上眼睛，希望美里会以为他在睡觉。然而，美里并没有这么想，她只是坐在床边，把手臂搭在他身上。

"Shinji, why did you do it? Is it because of me?"  
"真嗣，你为什么要这么做？是因为我吗？"

"No, it's not that…"  
"不，不是那样的……"

"Then why?"

"I just didn't want you to abandon me."  
"我只是不想你抛弃我。"

"Shinji, why would I do that?"  
"真嗣，我为什么要那么做？"

"Because everyone else has, you'll be no different, it'd have been better if you just left me."  
"因为其他人也都这样，你也不会有什么不同，如果当初你直接离开我就好了。"

Shinji sat up and looked directly at Misato, she saw tears had now started to move down his face. Misato however, was now beyond crying instead all she felt was anger at the boy's words.  
真嗣坐起身来，直视着美里，她看到泪水已经开始从他的脸上滑落。然而，美里此刻已经哭不出来，她只感到对男孩这些话的愤怒。

"I see…"

"Sorry…"

"Sorry? That's all you have to say, sorry isn't going to cut it Shinji. How can you say such a thing like that?"  
"抱歉？你就只能说这个吗，光说抱歉是没用的，真嗣。你怎么能说出那样的话？"

"Because it's true, everyone abandons me."  
"因为那是事实，每个人都抛弃了我。"

Misato done something at that moment that shocked her, it shocked Shinji as well. He knew he deserved it though, he had gone too far. He brought his hand up to his cheek from where Misato had just slapped him. She started shouting at him.  
那一刻，美里做出了一个让她自己也震惊的举动，同样震惊了真嗣。但他知道这是他应得的，他做得太过分了。他抬起手，抚摸着美里刚刚扇了他一巴掌的脸颊。她开始对他大喊。

"You ungrateful idiot, you think that after I take you in and go through all that to adopt you I'm just going to abandon you? You think that after I spend half the night looking for you only to find you unconscious that I'm just going to abandon you?"  
"你这个不知感恩的傻瓜，你以为我把你带回家，费尽心思领养你之后，就会轻易抛弃你吗？你以为我整夜寻找你，却发现你昏迷不醒后，就会轻易抛弃你吗？"

He didn't respond, instead he just looked down at the sheets, rubbing his cheek.  
他没有回应，只是低头看着床单，揉了揉脸颊。

"You're not the only person in the world to have something bad happen to them Shinji."  
"世界上不止你一个人经历过不幸，真嗣。"

"I know that but… "  
"我知道，但是……"

"But nothing, if you want to leave then do it now and we won't have to see each other again. I'll take you back to the agency tomorrow and say it didn't work out. If that's what you truly want then I'm not going to stop you, Shinji. Make up your mind now because next time I'm not coming after you."  
"但别再找借口了，如果你想离开，那就现在走，我们以后也不必再见面。明天我会带你回总部，就说合作不顺利。如果你真心想走，我不会阻拦你，真嗣。现在就决定吧，因为下次我不会再来找你了。"

Shinji didn't say anything as he contemplated Misato's words, maybe he was being stupid and maybe things would turn out differently this time for him. He had been so used to being on his own that when someone tried to reach out and get close to him he just felt like they would abandon him after a while, just like his father.  
真嗣沉默不语，思索着美里的话，或许他一直很愚蠢，或许这次情况会有所不同。他早已习惯独自一人，每当有人试图接近他，他总觉得对方最终会像他父亲一样抛弃他。

"Well what is it going to be?"  
“那么，你打算怎么办？”

Shinji still didn't, speak instead he just put his arms around Misato and held onto her sobbing into her shoulder. Her expression of anger soon changed to that of sympathy.  
真嗣仍然没有说话，只是张开双臂抱住美里，将脸埋在她的肩头哭泣。她脸上的愤怒很快转变为同情。

"I see, lets go home Shinji."

**Present Day – Docks District – 1835 hours.  
今日——码头区——18 时 35 分。**

The two agent's car pulled up outside the abandoned warehouse, they parked it under one of the broken streetlamps and cautiously got out of the car. Shinji nervously looked around him and saw the area was mostly abandoned and derelict. Across the street an abandoned bus shelter caught Shinji's eye.  
两位特工的车停在了废弃仓库外，他们将车停在了一盏破损的路灯下，小心翼翼地下了车。真嗣紧张地环顾四周，发现这片区域大多已被遗弃，破败不堪。街对面一个废弃的公交候车亭吸引了真嗣的目光。

Asuka noticed he seemed to be looking intently at it as she withdrew her gun she went over to him and nudged him slightly.  
明日香注意到他似乎正专注地盯着那里，她拔出手枪，走到他身边，轻轻地碰了他一下。

"Agent Ikari, are you ready to do this?"  
“碇特工，准备好行动了吗？”

He was brought back into reality and he too withdrew his pistol and nodded.  
他被拉回现实，也随即拔出手枪，点头示意。

"Yes, are you sure this is the right place?"  
“是的，你确定这是正确的地方吗？”

"Yes, this place was recently bought by a man known as Hideo Kisaragi, I ran his name against the criminal database and he appears linked with several crime syndicates in Tokyo 3, he was also linked with an attack ten years ago involving our man Mizushima. He received three bullet wounds to the head in said attack."  
“没错，这个地方最近被一个名叫如月英年的人买下，我查了他的名字与犯罪数据库，发现他与东京 3 区的几个犯罪集团有关联，十年前他还与我们的目标水岛有关的一次袭击事件有关。在那次袭击中，他头部中了三枪。”

"Sounds like him then, shouldn't we inform Misato first?"  
"听起来确实像他，我们是不是应该先通知美里？"

Asuka shook her head.  
明日香摇了摇头。

"We don't have time, by the time they get here he might have already gone."  
"我们没时间了，等他们赶到这里，他可能已经走了。"

Shinji nodded in agreement and looked at the warehouse one more time, from where he stood there appeared to be a front entrance, he could also make out an alley round the back, possibly leading to a back or side entrance. Asuka continued speaking.  
真嗣点头同意，再次望向仓库，从他站立的位置看去，前方似乎有一个正门，同时他也注意到后方有一条小巷，可能通向侧门或后门。明日香继续说道。

"You look round the back for another way in, I'll take the direct route."  
“你去后面找找其他入口，我走直接路线。”

Shinji nodded and headed round the side of the warehouse trying to find another way in. Asuka watched him slip into the distance before she turned and looked over at the bus shelter, wondering why Shinji was looking so intently at it. After a few moments of readying herself she quickly ran up to the front entrance to the warehouse and tested the door.  
真嗣点头后绕向仓库侧面，试图寻找其他入口。明日香目送他消失在视线中，随后转身看向公交车站，疑惑真嗣为何如此专注地盯着它。在做好准备后，她迅速跑向仓库的正门，尝试推门。

'_Sheisse, it's locked.'_ “该死，锁住了。”

She fumbled about in her jacket pocket for her NERV Lock pick and inserted it into the lock. Asuka wondered if Shinji was yet to find a way in and also if this was indeed the place where their suspect was hiding out. She also wondered what would happen if their director of operations caught wind of what they were doing. She knew full well that they should have told her what was happening, but Asuka didn't want to let anyone else take the credit for solving this, it was a matter of pride for her.  
她在夹克口袋里摸索着找到 NERV 的锁具撬棒，插入锁中。明日香想知道真嗣是否已经找到了进入的方法，以及这里是否真的是他们嫌疑犯藏身的地方。她还想知道如果他们的行动主任得知他们在做什么会发生什么。她很清楚他们应该告诉她发生了什么，但明日香不想让任何人抢走解决这个问题的功劳，这对她来说是关乎自尊的事情。

After a while the lock clicked and she was able to open the door, she slowly readied her gun and opened the door slightly and looked inside. Towards the far side of the warehouse a small fire was lit and she could make out the shadow of a man standing by it. She clutched her gun tightly and pointed it at the man.  
过了一会儿，锁咔嗒一声开了，她缓缓准备好枪，轻轻推开门向内窥视。在仓库的远端，一个小火堆被点燃，她能辨认出站在火堆旁的一个男人的身影。她紧紧握住枪，指向那个男人。

"Hideo Kisaragi?"

She edged closer to the man still keeping her gun trained on him, the man was silent. As she got closer she called out again.  
她小心翼翼地靠近那个男人，枪口始终对准着他，而那男人却沉默不语。随着她逐渐接近，她再次大声呼喊。

"Excuse me, Hideo Kisaragi?"

As she got nearer she noticed something else about the man, he was not standing he was hanging. She felt sick to her stomach as the body turned around hanging from the rafters of the roof. She stumbled backwards dropping her gun in the process as she stared in shock at the hanging body in front of her.  
当她更靠近时，她注意到了男人的另一个特征，他并非站立，而是悬挂着。当尸体随着屋顶横梁转动时，她感到胃里一阵恶心。她踉跄后退，手中的枪也因此掉落，震惊地盯着眼前悬挂的尸体。

'_Oh god no not this, come on Asuka pull yourself together… it's only a body, you've seen plenty, need to stay focused'_  
'哦，天哪，不要这样，振作点，Asuka，这只是具尸体，你见得多了，需要保持专注'

She kneeled down to pick up her pistol again, but it moved away just as she went to grasp hold of it. She watched as it scraped across the floor into someone's waiting hand.  
她跪下再次去捡她的手枪，但它却恰在她伸手去抓时移开了。她眼看着它刮过地板，落入了某人等待的手中。

"I see you people won't stop sticking your noses in where it's not wanted."  
“我看你们这些人就是不肯罢休，非得插手不该管的事。”

Asuka glared at him, showing no fear.  
明日香瞪着他，毫无惧色。

"Who are you?" "你是谁？"

"The very person you came here to apprehend, but you see the thing is my dear NERV Agent, I cannot allow you to do that. Not until I have had my retribution."  
"你来此要逮捕的人正是我，但亲爱的 NERV 特工，我不能让你这么做。在我得到我的复仇之前，不行。"

"So that's what this is about? Retribution?"  
"所以这一切都是为了复仇？"

"Precisely, ten years ago those 'people' betrayed me, they left me in a pool of my own blood and now I am doing the very same to them."  
"正是如此，十年前那些人背叛了我，让我倒在血泊中，现在我要对他们做同样的事。"

"You won't be able to get away with this, NERV knows who you are and where you are, it'll only be a matter of time until you're caught."  
"你逃不掉的，NERV 知道你是谁，也知道你在哪儿，被抓只是时间问题。"

"How exactly are they going to catch me? You have seen for yourself what I am capable of."  
"他们究竟要怎么抓我？你亲眼见过我的本事。"

At that point a knife flew out if his pocket and straight past Asuka's head into the body behind her.  
就在这时，一把刀从他口袋里飞出，擦过明日香的头，直直插入了她身后的人的身体。

"I suppose maybe I should thank my old associates for allowing me this opportunity, unfortunately you won't be around to see it."  
"我想我或许该感谢我的老同伙给了我这个机会，可惜你没机会看到了。"

He raised Asuka's gun and aimed it directly at her head, his finger was poised on the trigger. She closed her eyes, bracing herself for the impact of the bullets, the sound of gunfire rang out across the warehouse. However to her surprise she was still standing when she opened her eyes. Instead the man was lying on the floor, still and lifeless.  
他举起明日香的手枪，直接对准她的头部，手指扣在扳机上。她闭上眼睛，准备迎接子弹的冲击，枪声在仓库中回荡。然而，令她惊讶的是，当她睁开眼睛时，自己仍然站着。相反，那个男人躺在地上，一动不动，毫无生气。

She blinked twice, wondering what had happened in those few moments she had her eyes shut. She spun around and saw Shinji standing in an open doorway, his pistol still aimed at the man's body. He slowly lowered his weapon and walked over to Asuka, he was about to speak when torchlight swept across the warehouse and a woman's voice rang out.  
她眨了两次眼，想知道在她闭眼的片刻发生了什么。她转身看到真嗣站在一扇敞开的门口，手枪仍然瞄准着那个男人的身体。他缓缓放下武器，走向明日香，正要开口说话时，仓库里扫过一道手电筒的光束，一个女人的声音响起。

"Stop right where you are."  
"就站在那儿别动。"

Shinji recognized the voice almost immediately and called out.  
真嗣几乎立刻就认出了那个声音，并喊了出来。

"Misato?"

The woman made her way into the warehouse and looked at the two agents and then to the body of the dead man lying on the floor.  
那女人走进仓库，先看了看两名特工，然后目光转向躺在地上的死者。

"Agent Ikari, Agent Sohryu, what do you think you were doing disobeying my orders and going after him by yourself?"  
"碇警官，绫波警官，你们以为自己在做什么？违抗我的命令，独自去追捕他？"

Both agents lowered their heads, all Shinji could manage was a muttered 'sorry'. Asuka however spoke clearer.  
两位特工都低下了头，真嗣只能勉强咕哝一声‘对不起’。但明日香说话更清晰。

"It was my idea, I thought if we waited he might have go…."  
"这是我的主意，我想如果我们等下去，他可能会逃……"

"That's enough Agent Sohryu, I'll speak to you later. Agent Ikari, can I have a word with you please?"  
"够了，碇司令，我稍后再和你谈。真嗣，能和我谈谈吗？"

Asuka nodded and left the warehouse, leaving a furious looking Misato to talk to Shinji.  
明日香点点头，离开了仓库，留下一脸怒气的美里和真嗣交谈。

"Why did you disobey my orders, Shinji?"  
"你为什么不服从我的命令，真嗣？"

"She was right though, he had already murdered someone else."  
"她说的没错，他确实已经谋害了另一个人。"

"I see, I'm not happy with it but you both caught him so that's the main thing. Ironic though, isn't it?"  
"我明白了，虽然我不满意，但你们俩抓住了他，这是最关键的。不过，这挺讽刺的，不是吗？"

"What do you mean?"  
"你什么意思？"

"Well meeting you again after a few years and the very same night I have to chew you out in this place."  
"哎，几年后再次遇见你，结果就在同一天晚上，我还得在这个地方训斥你。"

"Eh?"

"Don't you recognize this place?"  
"你难道认不出这个地方吗？"

They slowly made their way outside and Shinji looked over at the bus shelter again, he smiled at her and nodded.  
他们缓缓走出外面，真嗣再次望向公交车站，他向她微笑并点头。

"Yes I do, this is where I ran to on that night thirteen years ago."  
"是的，我记得，这就是十三年前那个夜晚我跑来的地方。"

"So you did remember?"  
"所以你确实记得？"

"How can I forget, I was ill for the next two weeks. I probably deserved it though."  
"我怎能忘记，接下来的两周我都病了。不过我可能也是活该。"

She chuckled.

"Yes you did, I'm glad we'll be working together Shinji. You and Asuka are an asset to NERV no matter what the others think or say. Sure you might have a few outlandish theories but you're a brilliant Agent, don't forget that."  
"没错，你确实如此，很高兴我们将一起工作，真嗣。无论别人怎么想或怎么说，你和明日香都是 NERV 的宝贵财富。虽然你们有些离奇的理论，但你们是出色的特工，别忘了这一点。"

Shinji was glad it was dark because he could feel himself turning red as Misato complemented him. They both said their goodbyes and Misato went over to talk to Asuka. Looking over again, Shinji could have sworn he saw someone running over to the bus shelter, he was sure it was a young brown haired boy in a white shirt and black trousers. He looked again and saw no one was there and smiled to himself as he headed back to the car.  
真嗣很庆幸天色已暗，因为他能感觉到自己在听到美里夸奖时脸红了。两人互道晚安后，美里走过去和明日香交谈。再次望去，真嗣几乎可以肯定他看到有人跑向公交车站，那是一个穿着白衬衫和黑裤子的棕发少年。他又看了一眼，却发现那里空无一人，便微笑着走回车里。

A/N: Well that's chapter four down, sorry for skipping a bit on the whole action against Hideo part but that wasn't really the focus of these two chapters. Chapter 3 was to introduce Misato and Chapter 4 to develop Shinji's character a bit. Hope you liked it anyway.  
作者注：好了，第四章结束了，很抱歉在对抗秀雄的部分跳过了一些内容，但这并不是这两章的重点。第三章是为了介绍美里，而第四章则是为了稍微发展一下真嗣的角色。希望你们仍然喜欢。

### Chapter 5 Blue Haired Girl  
第五章 蓝发女孩

_May 2015_ 1st **Restricted Facility – 2230 hours**  
2015 年 5 月 1 日 第一限制设施 – 2230 时

Fuyutsuki glanced over at the man speaking on the telephone and then back down at the newspaper in his hand. In the darkness of the office it could be seen that the paper was at least three weeks old. Across the top the headline stated 'Bodies of abducted children found.' The article in question was relating to the case three weeks ago in which two NERV agents found the bodies of the children in the lakes. Of course there was no mention of NERV within the article, thanks to a media cover up by the committee.  
冬月瞥了一眼正在打电话的男人，然后又低头看向手中的报纸。在办公室的昏暗光线下，可以看出这份报纸至少有三周之久。头版头条写着：'被绑架儿童的尸体被发现。' 这篇文章涉及三周前的事件，当时两名 NERV 特工在湖中发现了这些孩子的尸体。当然，文章中并未提及 NERV，这要归功于委员会的媒体封锁。

'_No they don't want anything getting out that could get in their way'_  
'不，他们不想让任何可能妨碍他们的事情泄露出去'

The other man got off the telephone and sat with his hands folded in front of him, his glasses reflecting in the dim light of the office. Fuyutsuki wondered how the man could be so calm in situations like this.  
另一位男子挂断电话，双手交叠坐在那里，眼镜在办公室昏暗的光线下反射着光芒。冬月好奇，这人怎能在这种情况下如此镇定。

"So what did Chairman Keel have to say for himself?"  
“那么，基尔议长自己怎么说？”

"The scenario is going as planned, he just informed me the next one is due to enter Tokyo 3 soon."  
“计划正按部就班进行，他刚通知我下一个即将进入东京 3 区。”

"Three weeks between them, they aren't giving us much time to prepare."  
"他们之间只隔了三周，这给我们准备的时间不多。"

"It was to be expected."  
"这是预料之中的事。"

"So what are we going to do about this one Ikari?"  
"那我们对此怎么办，碇？"

The man produced a set of documents from his desk drawer and placed them on the desk in front of him.  
那人从办公桌抽屉里拿出一套文件，放在自己面前的桌子上。

"I want you to give these to the new Director of Operations. They include instructions on the man and also a notice to give the case to the new products."  
“我希望你把这些交给新任运营总监。其中包括对那个人的指示，以及将案件移交给新产品的通知。”

Fuyutsuki frowned when he heard Ikari say the word 'Products' knowing full well that one of the products in question was in fact Ikari's own son.  
听到碇说'产品'这个词时，冬月皱起了眉头，他完全清楚其中一件产品实际上是碇自己的儿子。

"Do you think they will be able to handle it?"  
“你觉得他们能应付得来吗？”

"She will start feeling the effects of the serum soon, he will be feeling the effects of the serum due to the increased dosage he was given. I will be sending Rei to keep track of them incase Unit One fails in some way."  
“她很快就会开始感受到血清的效果，由于他接受的剂量增加，他也会感受到血清的效果。我会派绫波去监控他们，以防初号机出现什么问题。”

"Unit One?"

"That is his designation as a part of the Evangelion project."  
“那是他在 EVA 计划中的代号。”

'_He is your own son Gendo and you can't even call him by name.'_  
“他是你的亲生儿子，源堂，你甚至都不愿叫他的名字。”

Fuyutsuki picked up the documents and put them in his inside jacket pocket. Just at that moment there was a knock at the office door, Gendo motioned for Fuyutsuki to open the door. When he did so the figure of Ritsuko Akagi stepped through into the office.  
冬月拿起文件，放入了内袋。就在这时，办公室的门被敲响了，源堂示意冬月去开门。门一开，赤木律子的身影便走了进来。

"Director, I believe you summoned for me."  
"导演，您召见我了吗？"

"Yes, Dr. Akagi, what is Rei's status?"  
"是的，赤木博士，零的状态如何？"

"She is still in stasis after the last run out, but stable."  
"她上次出击后仍处于休眠状态，但情况稳定。"

"Have her ready by tomorrow, I'm sending her out."  
"明天之前让她准备好，我要把她送出去。"

"Yes sir."

_2nd May 2015_

**NERV Offices – 0915 hours  
NERV 总部 – 0915 时**

"Wait! Stop the…."

It was too late, the doors closed just as Shinji reached them. From inside he was sure he could hear the person laughing.  
太迟了，门刚好在真嗣赶到时关闭。他确信自己能听到里面有人在笑。

"…elevator…. Bastards."

He watched as the elevator panel showed it going all the way up to the 20th floor and it just stopped there. Shinji had not been having a brilliant morning, his alarm clock had bust, causing him to wake up late and he had then had to get the bus to work after his car had broke down. It was an experience he didn't want to replicate any time soon.  
他看着电梯面板显示它一路升至 20 楼，然后就停在那里不动了。真嗣今天早上过得并不顺心，他的闹钟坏了，导致他起床晚了，之后又因为车子抛锚不得不赶公交去上班。这种经历他可不想在近期内再重复一次。

'_To make matters worse my head feels like it's being crushed between two boulders'_  
'更糟糕的是，我的头感觉像是被两块巨石夹在中间碾压一样'

He checked his watch as he waited for the elevator to come back down, after what seemed to be an eternity the elevator doors opened, allowing him to go down to his office.  
他一边等待电梯下来，一边查看手表，仿佛过了一个世纪，电梯门终于打开，让他得以下到办公室。

'_Why this building doesn't have stairs going down there I don't know…'_  
“我不明白为什么这栋楼没有向下的楼梯……”

The elevator finally made its way down his section and he quickly rushed along to the office, his head still pounding. To his surprise, Misato was already inside the office in conversation with Asuka. He made his way in and hung his jacket up and went over to his desk. Misato's eyes followed him with a concerned look on her face.  
电梯终于到达了他的楼层，他迅速冲向办公室，头依旧隐隐作痛。令他惊讶的是，美里已经在办公室里和明日香交谈。他走进去，挂好外套，走向自己的办公桌。美里的目光紧随其后，脸上带着关切的神情。

"Good morning Agent Ikari, are you feeling alright you're looking rather pale?"  
“早上好，碇君，你看起来脸色不太好，感觉还好吗？”

"I'm alright, haven't had the best of mornings and got a bit of a head ache that's all."  
"我没事，只是早上不太顺心，有点头疼罢了。"

Shinji looked around the office and saw Misato clutching a brown envelope in her hand, Asuka was busily typing away on her computer.  
真嗣环顾办公室，看到美里手里紧握着一个棕色信封，明日香则在电脑前忙碌地敲打着键盘。

"What's going on?" "发生了什么事？"

Misato gave him a confused look and then realized what he was talking about. She looked at the envelope and pulled out the documents inside.  
美里露出困惑的表情，随即意识到他在说什么。她看了看信封，从中抽出了里面的文件。

"They're details of a case you two have been assigned to, straight from the Director of NERV. They were left on my desk this morning."  
“这是你们俩被分配到的案件的细节，直接来自 NERV 的指挥官。今早放在我桌上了。”

Shinji stood up and made his way over to Asuka's desk as Misato pulled out the documents and laid them out on the desk. Shinji took a look at the top sheet of the documents, it showed what appeared to be a hooded man. It was a record of this man, most of the sections were blank except for the aliases there was a name Shinji recognized.  
真嗣站起身，走向明日香的桌子，美里拿出文件并摊开在桌上。真嗣看了一眼最上面的文件，上面显示着一个似乎是戴着兜帽的男人。这是一份关于这个男人的记录，大部分部分都是空白的，除了别名那里有一个真嗣认识的名字。

"Shamshel?"

Misato looked up at him curiously.  
美里好奇地抬头看着他。

"You recognize the name?"  
"你认得这个名字？"

"Yes, the name has been synonymous with cult activity in sections of Japan. The leader of this cult supposedly goes by this alias."  
"是的，这个名字在日本某些地区与邪教活动紧密相关。据说该邪教的领袖就使用这个化名。"

"Cult?"

"Investigations into the cult have gone nowhere due to lack of evidence or information, but it is believed they target doctors and scientists. I remember reading the case file on them when I came to this section."  
"对该邪教的调查因缺乏证据或信息而毫无进展，但据信他们专门针对医生和科学家。我记得刚到这个部门时读过他们的案件档案。"

"I see, well it is believed that this Shamshel guy is in Tokyo 3 now and the Director wants you two to investigate him."  
"我明白了，据说这个叫夏姆谢尔的家伙现在在第三东京市，总监希望你们两个去调查他。"

Shinji handed the document to Asuka who glanced over it and put it back down.  
真嗣将文件递给明日香，她匆匆浏览了一遍，又放了回去。

"What else is in that case file?"  
"那份案件档案里还有什么内容？"

"Potential targets and locations this person might be in."  
可能的目标和此人可能所在的位置。

Misato produced another document and handed it to Asuka, Asuka quickly scanned over the various locations on the document.  
美里又拿出一份文件递给明日香，明日香迅速浏览了文件上列出的各个地点。

"How are we supposed to cover all of these locations, they've put down everything from vets surgeries to hospitals to school nurses."  
我们怎么可能覆盖所有这些地点，他们列出了从兽医诊所到医院再到学校护士站的一切。

"Agent Sohryu is right Misato, we can't work from this list, we don't even know if this Shamshel is going to hit any of these places"  
「索希尔」真的会袭击这些地方吗？美里，草薙少佐说得对，我们不能仅凭这份名单行动。

Misato gathered together the documents on the table and sighed as she put them back into the envelope. She wished she could help the two agents more but there was nothing she could do. The orders from the director were to not include anyone else from NERV in the investigation aside from Asuka and Shinji.  
美里将桌上的文件整理好，叹了口气，把它们放回信封。她多希望能为这两位特工提供更多帮助，但无能为力。总监的命令是，除了明日香和真嗣外，不得让 NERV 的其他人参与调查。

"Well there's more within the envelope for you two to look at, the Director wants you two working on this though and only you two for some reason. No one else in NERV is to get involved."  
信封里还有更多资料供你们研究，总监希望只有你们两人负责此事，且仅限于你们。NERV 的其他成员不得介入。

Shinji thought it was a bit strange but nodded, Asuka however did not react with the same courtesy.  
真嗣觉得这有点奇怪，但还是点了点头，然而明日香却没有表现出同样的礼貌。

"Only us two? So we aren't to tell anyone else about this case?"  
“只有我们两个？所以我们不能告诉其他人这个案子吗？”

"Yes that is correct, it would seem they want this guy really badly."  
“是的，没错，看来他们真的很想要这个人。”

Misato stood up and straightened her jacket.  
美里站起身，整理了一下她的夹克。

"Well I'll leave you two to it, good luck."  
“好吧，我就不打扰你们俩了，祝你们好运。”

With that she promptly left the room, leaving behind and angry looking Asuka and a confused Shinji. Shinji jumped slightly as Asuka slammed her hand down on the desk.  
说完，她迅速离开了房间，留下一脸怒容的明日香和困惑的碇真嗣。真嗣被明日香猛拍桌子的动作吓了一跳。

"Well this is brilliant, how do they expect us to do anything with just a name and a list of locations?"  
“这真是糟糕透顶，他们指望我们凭一个名字和一堆地点就能做什么？”

Asuka looked up at Shinji expecting a reply, instead he just continued reading the document in front of him appearing to be completely engrossed in it.  
明日香抬头看着真嗣，期待他的回答，但他只是继续阅读面前的文件，似乎完全沉浸其中。

"Ikari, I asked you a question?"  
“碇，我问你话呢？”

"I heard, I'm just double checking that we didn't miss something."  
"我听说了，只是再确认一下我们没漏掉什么。"

"Like what?"

"Hidden message or something,"  
"隐藏信息之类的吧，"

"And have we missed anything?"  
"那我们有没有漏掉什么？"

"Can't seem to see anything, you were right. This is completely useless, we have nothing to work with."  
"好像什么都看不见，你说得对。这完全没用，我们没有任何线索可循。"

"So what do we do? You're the one who is interested in cult activity and crap like that."  
"那我们该怎么办？你对那些邪教活动之类的东西感兴趣。"

"Well we can probably start by looking through any previous case files mentioning Shamshel and then try to find anything on the supposed cult I guess."  
"我们可以先从查阅任何提及 Shamshel 的过往案件档案开始，然后再试着找找关于那个所谓的邪教的线索。"

Shinji moved back over to his desk stopped halfway to clutch his head as a sudden pain shot through him. His vision became blurry as he slowly made his way back to his desk, trying to hide the fact he was in so much pain. He slowly sat down and waited for the pain to eventually subside before looking back over the documents. He looked over the picture of the hooded man supposed to be Shamshel, trying to notice any distinguishable marks on the hood that might help him and Asuka in starting out.  
真嗣挪回自己的书桌，中途却突然头痛欲裂，不得不停下脚步紧抱头部。视线变得模糊，他缓缓走向书桌，尽力掩饰自己正承受着剧痛。他慢慢坐下，等待疼痛逐渐消退，然后再次审视那些文件。他仔细观察着那张被认为是沙姆谢尔的蒙面男子照片，试图找出帽子上的任何可辨认标记，以便自己和明日香能有所发现。

"Ikari."

"Yes Agent Sohryu."

"What does Shamshel mean?"  
“沙姆谢尔是什么意思？”

"I don't know."

Asuka sighed before continuing.  
明日香叹了口气，继续说道。

"I thought you were supposed to know all about this sort of thing."  
"我以为你应该对这种事情了如指掌。"

"Sorry…"

"Doesn't matter, it's not your fault, I'm just wondering why the leader of this cult would choose such a name. Maybe if we found it's meaning we might be able to find out more about him."  
"没关系，这不是你的错，我只是好奇为什么这个邪教的头目会选择这样一个名字。也许如果我们找到它的含义，就能了解更多关于他的信息。"

"You can take a look, I'm going to look over the case records for any mentioning of this guy's name."  
"你可以看看，我要去查一下案件记录，看有没有提到这个人的名字。"

Asuka watched Shinji as he exited the room, noticing he had gone even paler since he had come in. She also noticed earlier how he had clutched his head when going over and wondered if he was alright. She quickly set her thoughts back on the case and began reading through the case files again and searching for anything to do with the name 'Shamshel'  
明日香看着真嗣走出房间，注意到他自从进来后脸色更加苍白了。她还注意到他之前在翻阅时曾紧抓着头，不知道他是否还好。她迅速将思绪转回到案件上，再次阅读案件文件，寻找与“沙姆谢尔”这个名字相关的任何线索。

**Commercial District – 1930 hours  
商业区 – 19:30**

Despite it being early May the skies above Tokyo 3 were incredibly dark, it was a strange side effect of the Second Impact Incident in old Tokyo, ever since that Japan had experienced unseasonable weather conditions from time to time. It was one of the many reasons most UFO Cults believed the impact was caused by aliens. No real explanation was given, most people didn't care for a reason. It is widely believed that the unseasonable conditions were due to the effects of chemicals being released into the air after Old Tokyo was destroyed.  
尽管已是五月初，第三新东京市的天空却异常昏暗，这是旧东京第二次冲击事件的奇怪副作用，自那以后，日本不时会遭遇反常的天气状况。这也是众多不明飞行物教派认为冲击是由外星人引起的众多原因之一。没有给出真正的解释，大多数人也不关心原因。普遍认为，反常的天气状况是由于旧东京被摧毁后空气中释放的化学物质造成的。

A rumble of thunder echoed over the district as the downpour began, suddenly people who weren't prepared for the rain began to run quickly to their destination. Those who were always prepared put up their umbrellas and began to walk around as normal. The reflections of the advertisements and billboards began to reflect in the puddles, gathering on the ground creating a dazzling effect and brightening up the area.  
雷声在街区上空隆隆作响，暴雨骤然而至，那些未备雨具的人们纷纷快步奔向目的地。而那些总是有备无患的人则撑起雨伞，如常行走。广告牌和霓虹灯的倒影在水洼中交织，地面上的积水映照出斑斓光影，为这片区域增添了几分炫目与明亮。

All of this was of no concern to the hooded man walking down past one of Tokyo 3's famous restaurants. There was only one thing on his mind, the rain, the lights and the people, it was all of no concern, the only thing he cared about was his mission. He crossed over the road into another street, slowly moving away from the bright lights of the commercial district. He stopped outside a building and lit a cigarette, he put his lighter back inside his pocket and slipped into a back alley. Slowly exhaling the smoke, he pulled out a cell phone and quickly dialed in a number.  
这一切对那位身披斗篷、行走在东京 3 区著名餐厅旁的男子而言，毫无意义。他的心中唯有一念，无论是雨、光还是人群，皆无关紧要，他唯一关心的只有他的任务。他跨过马路，缓缓远离商业区的璀璨灯火，驻足于一栋建筑前，点燃了一支香烟，将打火机揣回口袋，随即闪身进入一条后巷。他缓缓吐出烟雾，掏出手机，迅速拨通了一个号码。

"I'm at the location, I will carry out the mission as planned."  
“我已到达指定地点，将按计划执行任务。”

"_What are our orders?"_ "我们的指令是什么？"

"I want you to deliver the packages I gave you to the people on the list."  
"我要你把给你的包裹送到名单上的人那里。"

"_Yes sir, there is one thing."_  
"是的，先生，有一件事。"

"What is that?" "那是什么？"

"_Our men have reported two NERV Agents are currently trying to find you, it would seem the committee is aware of your presence in Tokyo 3."_  
"我们的人报告说，有两名 NERV 特工正在试图找到你，看来委员会已经知道你在第三新东京市的存在了。"

"Our plans have not changed, I have said for some time we are on a limited schedule. Let them send their agents, we will do what needs to be done."  
"我们的计划没有改变，我已经说过一段时间了，我们的时间有限。让他们派特工来吧，我们会做该做的事。"

"_Yes sir."_

He hung up his cell phone and stepped out of the alley way, putting out his cigarette. Looking over at the building opposite the alley, he muttered something under his breath.  
他挂断手机，走出巷子，熄灭了烟。目光扫过对面的大楼，他低声自语了几句。

"_Tonight it begins, those who attempted to trespass shall be punished for their crimes."_  
“今晚，一切开始，那些胆敢擅闯者将为他们的罪行付出代价。”

He slowly made his way over to the building and stepped into the lobby. To his relief there was no one around, he looked up at a listing of the floors near the stairs, tracing his finger over the names on there. He stopped when he got to one name and smiled coldly.  
他缓缓走向那栋大楼，步入空无一人的大堂。他抬头看向楼梯旁的楼层指示牌，手指沿着上面的名字一一划过。当指尖停在某一个名字上时，他冷冷地笑了。

'_So this is where you've been hiding.'_  
“所以你一直躲在这里。”

He slowly began making his way up the stairs to his destination and stopped when he reached the fifth floor. Slowly opening the door he paused when he saw a flashlight moving down the corridor, just then two voices could he heard ringing through the corridor.  
他缓缓开始向目的地楼层走去，到达五楼时停了下来。慢慢推开门，他注意到走廊里有一束手电筒的光在移动，就在这时，两道声音穿透了走廊。

"_Dr Kato, working late again I see."_  
“加藤博士，又在加班了，我看得出来。”

"_Yes, I'll be out soon, just got to send this research off."_  
"是的，我很快就出去，只是得先把这份研究资料发出去。"

In the darkness the man smiled as he waited for the conversation between the guard and doctor to end. Once it did, he watched as the security guard left the room and walked down to the other end of the corridor and round the corner. That was his cue, he stepped out into the corridor and towards the doctor's office. Slowly opening the door, he lowered his hood as he entered, he stepped foot into the office and grinned as he watched the doctor's look of fear when he noticed him.  
在黑暗中，那人微笑着等待警卫和医生之间的对话结束。一旦对话结束，他看着保安离开房间，走向走廊的另一端并转过拐角。这是他的信号，他走出走廊，朝医生的办公室走去。慢慢地打开门，他放下兜帽进入房间，踏进办公室，看到医生脸上露出的恐惧表情时，他咧嘴笑了。

"You… no it's not possible."  
"你……不，这不可能。"

"I'm glad you remembered me, although I'm surprised the committee didn't already warn you I was coming."  
"我很高兴你还记得我，尽管我惊讶于委员会没有事先警告你我要来。"

"The Committee… I haven't had any contact with them since…"  
"委员会……自从……以来，我就没有和他们联系过。"

"Since I and the other rejects were cast out, are those the words you're looking for."  
"自从我和其他被淘汰者被驱逐出去，你是不是在找这些词。"

"That's not it, after that. Gehrin was disbanded we were all in the same situation."  
"那不是重点，之后的事。解散后，我们大家都处于同样的境地。"

"Were we really Doctor? So was your situation wandering through the middle of nowhere for five days with no hope of survival."  
"我们真的那样吗，博士？你的处境也是在中途漫无目的地徘徊五天，毫无生存希望。"

"We... I... there was no other choice, you were dangerous."  
"我们... 我... 别无选择，你很危险。"

"Yes I was, and who do I have to thank for that. Now they're at it again, only my sources have told me that they have improved the serum."  
"是的，我曾是，我得感谢谁呢。现在他们又开始了，只是我的消息来源告诉我，他们改进了血清。"

"I swear I've heard nothing."  
"我发誓我什么都没听说。"

"You're just as bad as them, I already know Doctor your little department here has been supplying part of the drug used. I can't prevent what they're planning, but I can delay their plans."  
"你和他们一样糟糕，我已经知道博士你的小部门一直在提供部分药物。我无法阻止他们的计划，但我可以拖延他们的行动。"

"If you're going to kill me then get on with it. They'll find you, they're stronger than you now, you were only the fourth. Your power is limited, your field is weak Shamshel."  
"如果你要杀我，那就快点动手。他们会找到你的，他们现在比你更强，你不过是第四名。你的力量有限，你的领域也很弱，沙姆谢尔。"

"I already know, that's why I'm going to take great pleasure in killing you."  
"我已经知道了，所以我会在杀你这件事上获得极大的快感。"

Shamshel laughed as he extended his A.T. field, sending the doctor flying against the wall. The doctor's body hit the ground with a sickening thud, he then produced something from his pocket, a small piece of rope. He walked over to the doctor and began to tie his hands together. Suddenly Shamshel's arm began to glow a bright red, he drew back and plunged his hand straight through the doctor's heart, leaving a splatter of blood all up the wall.  
沙姆谢尔笑着展开了他的 A.T.领域，将医生猛地甩向墙壁。医生的身体重重地摔在地上，发出一声令人作呕的闷响，随后他从口袋里掏出一样东西，一小段绳子。他走向医生，开始将他的双手绑在一起。突然，沙姆谢尔的手臂开始发出鲜红色的光芒，他猛地抽回手，直插医生的心脏，留下一墙的血迹。

He withdrew his hand and his arm returned to normal, just at that moment the security guard burst into the room, just as Shamshel put his hood back up.  
他收回手，手臂恢复了正常，就在这时，保安猛地冲进房间，而沙姆谢尔正好重新戴上了兜帽。

"Who are you… what have you done to… oh my god."  
“你是谁……你把……哦，我的天哪。”

The guard pointed his gun at Shamshel as soon as he saw the doctor's dead body lying on the floor. Without saying anything further he fired two shots directly at him, much to his shock the bullets just seemed to reflect from a wall of light that emanated from Shamshel.  
保安一看到医生躺在地上的尸体，立刻将枪口对准了沙姆谢尔。没再多说什么，他直接开了两枪，令他震惊的是，子弹似乎被从沙姆谢尔身上发出的光墙弹开了。

"I apologize for this but I cannot die yet, I must see who has been chosen."  
"我很抱歉，但我还不能死，我必须看看是谁被选中了。"

With those words Shamshel extended his A.T. Field at the guard and sent him flying back into the wall with a force that sent the guards neck snapping back. Shamshel stepped over to the guard's motionless body and checked for a pulse. He slowly picked up the guards gun and fired three shots directly into his skull, sending blood splattering all over the tiled floor. He calmly wiped any blood from the gun clean on his jacket and placed it back down next to the guard before walking away, back towards the stairs.  
说完这些话，Shamshel 展开了他的 A.T.力场，将守卫击飞撞到墙上，强大的冲击力使得守卫的脖子猛地向后折断。Shamshel 走到守卫的静止不动的身体旁，检查了一下脉搏。他慢慢地捡起守卫的枪，对着他的头颅连开三枪，鲜血四溅在瓷砖地板上。他平静地用夹克擦拭掉枪上的血迹，然后将枪放回守卫身边，转身走回楼梯。

**Asuka's residence – 2030 hours  
明日香的家 – 晚上 20:30**

Asuka stepped out of the shower and wrapped the towel around her firmly. She turned the radio dial and looked at herself in the mirror, just at that moment her phone began to ring. She sighed and made her way out of the bathroom, her wet hair dripping water down onto the carpet.  
明日香走出淋浴间，紧紧地裹上毛巾。她转动收音机的旋钮，对着镜子中的自己，就在这时，她的手机开始响了起来。她叹了口气，走出浴室，湿漉漉的头发滴水在地毯上。

"Hello."

"_Agent Sohryu, its Katsuragi."_

Asuka picked up the cordless phone and took it into her room and began to dry herself off while talking to the operations director.  
明日香拿起无绳电话，走进房间，一边和运营总监通话，一边开始擦干身体。

"Yeah, what can I do for you?"  
“嗯，有什么我能帮忙的吗？”

"_Is Shinji with you?_ "真嗣跟你在一起吗？"

"No, I'm at home, why would he be with me, we left work hours ago."  
"没有，我在家，他怎么会跟我在一起，我们几个小时前就下班了。"

"_I can't get in touch with him at home or on his cell phone."_  
"我联系不上他，家里和手机都打不通。"

"Maybe he just went out and forgot to take it."  
"也许他只是出去了，忘了带上它。"

"_Probably, anyway I'm just wondering if you noticed something strange about him today."_  
"可能吧，不过我只是在想你今天有没有注意到他有什么奇怪的地方。"

"You mean more so than usual in the four weeks I've known him."  
"你是说比我在认识他的这四周里见到的还要奇怪吗？"

"_I'm being serious Sohryu, he looked ill today and didn't seem to be himself."_  
"我是认真的，龙，他今天看起来病了，而且不太像平时的他。"

"I noticed it as well, but most people act a bit strange when they're ill. You know him more than me, if he's ill what does he act like."  
"我也注意到了，但大多数人病了都会有点奇怪。你比我还了解他，如果他病了，他会是什么样子？"

"_He acts like that, tries not to let anyone know something's wrong with him."_  
"他就是那样，尽量不让任何人知道他有什么不对劲。"

"Well there you go, that's probably it."  
“好吧，就是这样，大概就是这样了。”

"_I think you're right, sorry I was just… concerned."_  
“我想你是对的，抱歉我只是……有点担心。”

Asuka was about to say goodbye and put the phone down when a glimmer of light from outside her house caught her eye.  
明日香正要道别并挂上电话，这时她家窗外的一束微光吸引了她的注意。

"Has someone from NERV been sent to watch our houses?"  
"NERV 派人来监视我们的房子了吗？"

_"I'm not aware of anything why?"  
"我不清楚，怎么了？"_

"Someone's outside in a black car, I just noticed them."  
"外面有辆黑车，我刚注意到。"

"_Directly outside?"_

"Yes directly, I can't see their face properly but they're watching the house."  
"是的，直接说吧，我看不清他们的脸，但他们确实在盯着房子。"

"_Can you go down to the bottom window to get a better look?"_  
"你能去底层的窗户那里看得更清楚些吗？"

"I'd love to but I've got nothing on, I just got out the shower."  
"我很想，但我现在一丝不挂，刚洗完澡出来。"

Asuka could hear Misato sighing over the phone, she was about to speak again when the car door opened. Asuka observed as a blue haired woman stepped out of the car. She closed the car door and Asuka watched as she just seemed to stare at the house.  
明日香能听到美里在电话那头叹气，她正要再次开口时，车门打开了。明日香注视着一位蓝发女子从车里走出来。她关上车门，明日香看着她似乎只是凝视着房子。

"Hold on, she just got out the car."  
“等等，她刚下车。”

Asuka mentally noted down details about the woman, she was about the same height as Asuka and a similar build. She had pale blue hair and her pale skin seemed to reflect in the streetlamps. Asuka still couldn't get a better look at the woman's face though. Just at that moment the woman looked straight up at Asuka, seemingly into Asuka's eyes. Asuka quickly tried to cover herself up and moved away from the window.  
明日香在心里记下关于这位女子的细节，她的身高和体型与明日香相似。她有着淡蓝色的头发，苍白的皮肤在路灯下似乎在反光。不过明日香还是看不清她的脸。就在这时，那女子直直地看向明日香，仿佛直视着她的眼睛。明日香迅速试图遮掩自己，并从窗边移开。

"She just spotted me, but I got a good look at her."  
"她刚发现了我，但我已经好好地看清了她。"

Asuka peered out again and noticed the woman and car had driven away.  
明日香再次向外窥视，发现那女人和车已经开走了。

"Katsuragi? Are you still there?"  
"葛城？你还在吗？"

_3rd May 2015_

**Commercial District – 1030 hours  
商业区 – 10:30**

Shinji watched as Asuka pulled into the parking space, feeling pathetic at his situation. His car was still down and he had been told not to drive by Misato, due to the headaches he was still suffering from. His condition had gotten worse since yesterday, he had failed to mention to both Asuka and Misato that he had blacked out last night, not wanting to worry them with anything.  
真嗣看着明日香把车停进车位，对自己的处境感到可悲。他的车还在修理中，而且美里告诉他由于头痛未愈，不要开车。自从昨天以来，他的状况恶化了，他没有向明日香和美里提及昨晚他昏迷过去的事，不想让他们担心。

The car came to a stop and both he and Asuka stepped out, he took the case file from the dashboard and looked around the area, to his surprise there were no ambulances or police cars to be found.  
车停稳后，他和明日香一起下了车，他从仪表盘上拿起案件文件，环顾四周，令他惊讶的是，没有发现救护车或警车的踪影。

"Are you sure this is the right place."  
"你确定这里是正确的地方吗？"

"This is the place we were told to go to by the operations director, does seem a bit strange that there's no one else here though. I thought she said it was a murder scene."  
"这是运营总监让我们来的地方，不过确实有点奇怪，这里一个人都没有。我以为她说的是谋杀现场。"

"Maybe when they said they only wanted us two to be in on it they really meant it."  
"也许当他们说只希望我们两个人参与时，他们是认真的。"

"Was this place on the list?"  
"这个地方在名单上吗？"

"I believe so." "我想是的。"

The two of them made their way into the building, just as they were entering, Asuka noticed two men leaving wearing lab coats, on the coats was a logo that looked strangely familiar, the image of a triangle with seven eyes within it. They stepped into the lobby and were greeted by Misato.  
他们两人走进了建筑物，就在他们进入时，明日香注意到两个穿着实验室外套的男人离开，外套上有一个看起来非常熟悉的标志，一个三角形内嵌着七只眼睛。他们步入大厅，被美里迎接。

"I'm glad you're here, they won't let anyone but you two see the body."  
"我很高兴你在这里，他们只允许你们两个看尸体。"

Shinji gave her a confused look and responded promptly.  
真嗣困惑地看了她一眼，随即回应道。

"Who won't?"

"The guys upstairs said it's a matter of up most importance that only you two see this and are involved with it."  
"楼上的那些人说，这件事极其重要，只有你们两个能看到并参与进来。"

"Did they say who they were?"  
"他们有说自己的身份吗？"

"No, but they had NERV ID and said it was orders directly from the director."  
"没有，但他们持有 NERV 的 ID，说是直接来自司令的命令。"

"Strange, well I guess we had better be getting up there."  
"奇怪，那我们还是赶紧上去吧。"

Misato nodded but stopped them before they were about to leave.  
美里点头，但在他们即将离开前叫住了他们。

"You two... be careful okay."  
“你们两个……小心点，好吗？”

Asuka smiled and replied.  
明日香微笑着回答。

"Of course we will, what can go wrong?"  
"当然会的，能出什么问题呢？"

**Crime Scene – 1045 hours**

The two agents approached the floor and were promptly stopped by two people wearing black suits.  
两名特工接近楼层时，立即被两名身穿黑西装的人拦下。

"Sorry we cannot allow you access to this area, directors orders."  
"抱歉，我们不能让您进入这个区域，这是导演的命令。"

Asuka pulled out her NERV ID and flashed it at the two men.  
明日香掏出她的 NERV 身份证，向两名男子晃了晃。

"Yes we already know, we're agents Sohryu and Ikari, we've been assigned this case."  
“是的，我们已经知道了，我们是代理员惣流和碇，我们被指派处理这个案件。”

"Sorry about that Miss Sohryu, go on ahead."  
“抱歉，惣流小姐，请继续前进。”

They entered the area and the first thing Asuka noticed was the awful smell emanating from the area. She looked around and saw the body of the doctor lying motionless, dried blood all over his clothes and a puddle of it on the floor. She looked around and noticed another body just outside the door. This one was that of the security guard, there was a gun lying in his outstretched hand and blood from the gun wounds in his head still seeping out onto the floor.  
他们进入这片区域，首先让明日香注意到的是那股令人作呕的恶臭。她环顾四周，看到医生的尸体一动不动地躺着，衣服上沾满了干涸的血迹，地板上还有一滩血泊。她四处张望，发现门外还有一具尸体。那是保安的，他伸出的手中握着一把枪，头部的枪伤仍在渗血到地板上。

"How disgusting…"

Shinji nodded in agreement.  
真嗣点头表示同意。

"How could someone do such a thing?"  
“怎么会有人做出这种事？”

He knelt down to examine the doctor's body and recoiled at what he saw. Around where the heart should be a hole went straight through the body, Shinji noticed a strange orange liquid dripping from the doctors clothing.  
他跪下检查医生的尸体，看到的一幕让他猛地后退。在心脏应该在的位置，一个洞直穿身体，真嗣注意到医生衣服上滴落着一种奇怪的橙色液体。

"Agent Sohryu, come and take a look at this. Recognize it?"  
“草薙特工，过来看看这个。认得吗？”

She knelt down beside him and looked at the liquid and nodded.  
她跪在他旁边，看着那液体，点了点头。

"That's the same thing we found during our first case isn't it. I'll collect a sample and we'll get it analyzed."  
"那和我们第一次案件中找到的东西是一样的，对吧。我会采集样本，然后送去分析。"

Shinji nodded and stood up, he went over to the window and looked out, in the alley opposite the building something caught his attention. It was a woman he then suddenly realized who it was.  
真嗣点点头，站起身来，走到窗边向外望去，在对面的巷子里有什么东西吸引了他的注意。那是一个女人，他随即突然意识到她是谁。

'_It's that woman from the Sachiel case, the one who attacked me.'_  
'那是萨基尔案件中的那个女人，袭击我的那个。'

"Stay here for a moment, I'm going to go check something out."  
"在这里等一下，我去查看点东西。"

"What is it?" "什么事？"

Shinji didn't give her a response, instead he motioned towards the alley, Asuka looked out and saw the woman standing there. She glared at her before turning around but by that time Shinji had already left the room.  
真嗣没有回应她，而是示意她看向小巷，绫波望出去，看到那个女人站在那里。她瞪了她一眼，然后转身，但那时真嗣已经离开了房间。

**Back alley – 1100 hours  
后巷 – 11 点整**

He entered the alley and looked around, to his dismay the woman had already gone. Shinji moved further in trying to see if maybe she had moved deeper into the alley. He was unsure why he was pursuing this woman but something compelled him to, this was the second time he had seen her, it couldn't be a mere coincidence. He turned the corner and just as he did so he felt immense pain increasing across his head, he became incredibly dizzy as his vision also began to blur.  
他走进小巷，环顾四周，令他沮丧的是，那女人已经不见了。真嗣继续深入，试图看看她是否已经更深入小巷。他不确定自己为何要追寻这个女人，但某种力量驱使着他，这是他第二次见到她，这不可能是单纯的巧合。他转过拐角，就在这时，他感到头部剧痛加剧，极度眩晕随之而来，视线也开始模糊。

Stumbling around the corner he tried to stop himself from falling, he leaned against the wall and promptly emptied the contents of his stomach onto the floor before collapsing to his knees. That was when he saw her again, she was standing directly in front of him, his vision began to return but the pain was still there he desperately tried to utter something.  
他踉跄着转过拐角，试图阻止自己跌倒，他靠在墙上，随即把胃里的东西吐了一地，然后跪倒在地。就在这时，他再次看到了她，她就站在他正前方，他的视线开始恢复，但疼痛依旧，他拼命试图说出些什么。

"Who… are... you…?" “你……是……谁……？”

Her emotionless face looked down at him but she gave no reply, he asked her again and this time she looked him directly in the eyes. This time she did speak, her voice was soft but stern.  
她面无表情地俯视着他，却未作回应，他再次询问，这次她直视他的眼睛。这次她开口了，声音柔和却坚定。

"I am Rei Ayanami, or Evangelion Unit 0"  
“我是绫波零，或是初号机。”

### Chapter 6 The Beast

_May 2015_ 3rd 2015 年 5 月 3 日

_What is this place? I feel… strange.  
这是什么地方？我感觉……很奇怪。_

Shinji felt himself surrounded in a strange orange glow, he looked at his surroundings and found himself sitting in some strange contraption. It was a seat which he was strapped into, he struggled against the straps and just then one of them snapped loose, allowing his arms to move freely. Shinji brought his hand up in front of his face and studied it closely, his skin had turned a pale white color. He felt himself jolt suddenly and he noticed his surroundings had changed.  
真嗣感到自己被一种奇异的橙色光芒包围，他环顾四周，发现自己坐在一个奇怪的装置里。他被安全带固定在座位上，挣扎着想要挣脱，这时其中一条带子突然松开，让他的手臂可以自由活动。真嗣将手举到眼前仔细观察，他的皮肤变成了苍白色。他突然感到一阵震动，发现周围的环境已经发生了变化。

He was no longer inside the strange contraption but was now standing in a hospital operating room. A group of doctors were stood around an operating table but they didn't seem to notice Shinji at all. All but one of the doctors moved away from the operating table and outside of the room. He looked at the other doctor and recognized her, it was the same one he had seen a few weeks ago during the Sachiel incident.  
他已不再身处那奇怪的装置之中，而是站在一间医院的手术室内。一群医生围在手术台旁，但他们似乎完全没有注意到真嗣。除了一个医生，其他人都从手术台旁离开，走出了房间。他看向留下的那位医生，认出了她，正是几周前在萨基尔事件中见过的那位。

_A…Akagi… was that her name? Where is this place?  
赤木律子……是她的名字吗？这里是什么地方？_

The doctor had a sad expression on her face and simply moved away from the body, he edged closer to it trying to get a better look and frowned when he looked at it. The face was blurred as if Shinji was looking at a criminal on one of those reality cop shows on TV. The door to the room opened and this time a man walked into the room, Shinji did not recognize this man but there was something about him that looked oddly familiar. The man was wearing dark glasses and wearing some sort of military uniform bearing the same seven eyed logo he had seen before. He had short brown hair and also a brown beard, Shinji tried to think where he had seen the man before, but it was to no avail. The man stepped into the room and passed by Shinji almost as if he didn't notice him and spoke to the Doctor.  
医生脸上带着悲伤的表情，只是从尸体旁移开，他则小心翼翼地靠近，试图看得更清楚，皱眉审视着。那张脸模糊不清，仿佛真嗣在看那些电视上的真实罪案节目中的罪犯。房间的门再次打开，这次走进来一个男人，真嗣并不认识他，但这个人却有种莫名的熟悉感。男人戴着墨镜，身穿某种军装，上面印着之前见过的七眼标志。他留着短短的棕色头发，还有棕色的胡须，真嗣努力回想在哪里见过这个人，却毫无头绪。男人走进房间，几乎像是没注意到真嗣一样从他身边经过，对医生说道。

"Risuko, why has he not yet been injected?"  
“律子，他为什么还没注射？”

"I am preparing the serum now."  
“我正在准备血清。”

"We do not have all night, the other one will be arriving soon and we need to prepare for him."  
"我们没有整晚的时间，另一个人很快就会到达，我们需要为他做准备。"

Shinji frowned as he heard the words, suddenly a realization hit him.  
真嗣皱起眉头，听到这些话时，他突然意识到什么。

_Is this… what happened to me and is that Agent Sohryu they're talking about?"  
这是……发生在我身上的事吗？他们说的那个特工草薙，是指我吗？"_

He watched as Ritsuko produced a needle from one of the trays and began filling it with a strange orange liquid. Once it was full she stepped over to the body on the table and went to inject it. Shinji found himself transfixed on the image as she began to inject the person's body. Just as the needle went into the body he felt pain shoot through every part of him as if someone was tearing him apart from the inside. He fell to his knee's screaming out in agony as everything around him turned to a blur. He looked on as the scene around him began to tear itself apart and he felt himself being torn from the world, still screaming out for someone to help him.  
他看着赤木律子从其中一个托盘里取出一根针，开始用一种奇怪的橙色液体填充它。一旦装满，她便走向桌上的身体，准备注射。真嗣发现自己被这一幕深深吸引，当她开始注射时，他感到一阵剧痛贯穿全身，仿佛有人从内部将他撕裂。他跪倒在地，痛苦地尖叫着，周围的一切都变得模糊不清。他眼睁睁地看着周围的场景开始自我撕裂，他感到自己正被从这个世界上撕扯出去，依然尖叫着寻求帮助。

**Misato's Apartment – 1245 hours  
美里公寓 – 12 时 45 分**

Shinji awoke suddenly. Screaming out, he jolted upwards nearly clashing with Misato who was looking over him with a concerned look. She put her arm around his shoulder and gently lay him back down, noting that he was sweating profusely. Just at that moment Asuka came into the room scowling.  
真嗣突然惊醒，尖叫着猛地坐起，差点撞上正关切地看着他的美里。她伸出胳膊搂住他的肩膀，轻轻地让他躺回去，注意到他正大汗淋漓。就在这时，明日香走进房间，皱着眉头。

"I see he's awake then."  
"看来他已经醒了。"

Misato turned to look at her.  
美里转头看向她。

"It would seem so, how are you doing?"  
"似乎是这样，你还好吗？"

"I've stopped the bleeding and bandaged it, stupid bitch, if I see her again I'm going to k…"  
"我已经止住了血并包扎好了，这个蠢婊子，如果我再见到她，我一定要……"

"Agent Sohryu you're a NERV Agent, its best not to talk like that."  
"草薙特工，你是 NERV 的特工，最好别那样说话。"

"Yeah yeah, I'll gently arrest her for assaulting an agent then but I swear I'm going to put my gun up..."  
"是是，我会温和地逮捕她，因为她袭击了特工，但我发誓我会把我的枪……"

"AGENT SOHRYU!" "SOHRYU 特工！"

"Okay, sorry." "好的，抱歉。"

"Could you both be quiet please, I feel like I've been ran over."  
"你们俩能安静点吗，我感觉自己像是被车碾过一样。"

Both Misato and Asuka turned to look at the voice belonging to Shinji. He no longer looked as pale but was still sweating a bit. It was an improvement, however, on how he looked when Asuka and Misato discovered him. Shinji took a deep breath and then spoke again.  
Misato 和 Asuka 同时转向声音的来源，那是 Shinji。他的脸色不再那么苍白，但仍在微微出汗。尽管如此，比起 Asuka 和 Misato 发现他时的样子，这已经是个进步了。Shinji 深吸了一口气，然后再次开口。

"Where am I?" “我在哪儿？”

"You're at my place Shinji, Asuka found you after you collapsed and we brought you here."  
“你在我的住处，Shinji。你昏倒后，Asuka 找到了你，我们把你带到了这里。”

Shinji looked around the apartment, noticing he was in Misato's front room. It was as he expected, very untidy even though she hadn't been in Tokyo 3 for very long. It brought a strange sort of comfort to Shinji, it was something he was familiar with although he had to admit he was glad he didn't have to clean up all the time like he did when he stayed with Misato.  
真嗣环顾了一下公寓，发现自己身处美里家的客厅。正如他所料，这里非常凌乱，尽管她并没有在第三新东京市待很久。这种熟悉感给真嗣带来了一种奇怪的安慰，虽然他不得不承认，他很高兴不必像和美里住在一起时那样经常打扫。

"What happened to… to the woman?"  
“那个女人……怎么了？”

Asuka interjected herself at that point.  
此时，明日香插话进来。

"You mean that blue haired bitch, well after you ran off I waited about five minutes and heard nothing from you so I came after you. I arrived to find you lying face down on the floor next to a pool of your own vomit and that bitch standing over you and then she attacked me!"  
"你是说那个蓝头发的婊子？你跑掉后，我等了大约五分钟，没听到你的动静，就追了过来。结果发现你脸朝下躺在地上，旁边是你吐的一滩东西，那婊子就站在你旁边，然后她攻击了我！"

"Attacked you?" "攻击你？"

"Yes attacked me, she punched me in the stomach then cut me with something. I tried to shoot her but she vanished by the time I got my gun out."  
"是的，她攻击了我，先是一拳打在我肚子上，然后用什么东西划伤了我。我想开枪打她，但等我掏出枪时她已经消失了。"

"Why would she attack you?"  
"她为什么要攻击你？"

"How am I supposed to know idiot, you're the one who seems to know her."  
"我怎么知道，白痴，你不是看起来跟她很熟吗。"

_Is she the one we're after, was it her that done that to Shinji?  
她是我们追查的那个人吗，是她在真嗣身上做了那些事吗？_

"This is the second time I've seen her."  
"这是我第二次见到她。"

This got both Misato and Asuka's attention, they watched on as Shinji pulled himself up into a seating position and began to tell them about it.  
这引起了美里和明日香的注意，他们看着真嗣自己坐起来，开始向他们讲述这件事。

"Agent Sohryu, do you remember when we were hunting the person known as Sachiel?"  
"苏里尤·明日香特工，你还记得我们追捕被称为萨基尔的人的时候吗？"

Asuka nodded. 明日香点了点头。

"I saw her, then she shot him and then attacked me, knocking me out."  
"我看见她了，然后她朝他开枪，接着袭击了我，把我打晕了。"

"You saw her? Then why didn't you tell me anything?"  
"你看见她了？那为什么之前什么都不告诉我？"

Shinji had been waiting for this moment, he didn't want to tell Asuka because he didn't want to put her in any danger. The place she came to get him from and the man known as Sachiel were connected and he wanted to find out how. He just didn't want to involve her, he had nearly died when he got to close to the woman and Sachiel and he didn't want that to happen to Asuka.  
真嗣一直在等待这个时刻，他不想告诉明日香是因为不想让她陷入危险。她来接他的地方和那个被称为萨基尔的男人有关联，他想弄清楚其中的关系。他只是不想牵扯到她，他曾因过于接近那个女人和萨基尔而差点丧命，他不希望同样的事情发生在明日香身上。

"I… didn't… I don't know, I just couldn't."  
"我…没有…我不知道，我就是做不到。"

"You idiot Shinji, when I found out where you were I asked you if anything had happened and you said no. You spoke about others hiding something yet you were hiding this from me, you moron."  
"你这个笨蛋真嗣，当我找到你在哪里时，我问你有没有发生什么事，你说没有。你谈论别人隐瞒事情，但你却对我隐瞒这个，你这个傻瓜。"

He hung his head and replied meekly.  
他垂下头，怯生生地回答。

"I know… I'm sorry."  
"我知道……对不起。"

Misato cut in before Asuka could launch another tirade at Shinji.  
美里在明日香再次对真嗣发飙之前打断了她。

"Both of you calm down, despite what's happened you two still have to work together and there's a murderer out there in Tokyo 3 that we need to find. More to the point, there's also this other woman who has assaulted one of my agents to track down."  
"你们两个都冷静下来，尽管发生了这些事，你们仍然需要合作，而且东京 3 区有个凶手我们需要找到。更重要的是，还有一个袭击了我一名特工的女人需要追踪。"

"Rei Ayanami" "绫波零"

"Huh?" "啊？"

"That's what she told me her name was."  
"她就是这么告诉我的名字。"

"I see, when did she tell you?"  
"我明白了，她是什么时候告诉你的？"

"Just before I passed out, she also mentioned Evangelion Unit 0 or something like that."  
"就在我昏过去之前，她还提到了什么 EVA 零号机之类的东西。"

Asuka cut in. 明日香插话道。

"Evangelion? What the hell is that?"  
"EVA？那到底是什么鬼东西？"

"I don't know, but I'm going to find out more about this."  
"我不知道，但我会进一步了解这件事。"

He went to stand up but as he did so Misato pushed him back onto the couch.  
他正要站起来，但就在这时，美里把他推回了沙发上。

"No you're not, you're staying here until we're certain you're fine. Agent Sohryu has already agreed to go back to NERV. Besides I want to hear more about this Sachiel case."  
"不行，你得留在这里，直到我们确定你没事。草薙特工已经同意返回 NERV。另外，我还想了解更多关于这个萨基尔案件的情况。"

"But I…" "但我……"

"But nothing, Agent Sohryu you don't mind going and digging up whatever you can find do you?"  
"但没什么好但的，草薙特工，你不介意去挖出你能找到的所有信息吧？"

"Not at all, I want to know more about this woman as well."  
"一点也不介意，我也想更多地了解这个女人。"

"Right, report whatever you find back immediately. Leave the liquid samples here as well."  
"好的，发现什么立即汇报。液体样本也留在这里。"

Shinji raised his head at the mention of this.  
听到这话，真嗣抬起了头。

"What liquid?" "什么液体？"

Asuka responded back to him.  
明日香回应了他。

"The samples I took of the liquid at the crime scene, we also found traces of it in the alley where you passed out. I think it's the same stuff we found when we dealt with Sachiel."  
“我在犯罪现场采集的液体样本，我们在你昏倒的小巷里也发现了它的痕迹。我想这和我们处理萨基尔时发现的东西是一样的。”

"I see." “我明白了。”

**NERV Offices – 1315 hours  
NERV 办公室 – 13 点 15 分**

Asuka made her way into the offices and hurriedly logged into the computer, pain shot through her bandaged hand as she typed in her username and password.  
明日香走进办公室，急忙登录电脑，输入用户名和密码时，绷带下的手传来一阵剧痛。

'_Stupid bitch she'd better hope we don't find anything or I'm going to make her life hell'_  
“这个蠢女人最好祈祷我们什么都没发现，否则我让她生不如死。”

As she waited for the computer to load up she went through all the events leading up to this moment and about the blue haired woman. She thought about Shinji mentioning he had seen her during their first case and then again and began to wonder if there was a connection between the two cases.  
她等待电脑启动时，回顾了所有导致此刻的事件，以及那位蓝发女子。她想起真嗣提到在他们的第一个案件中见过她，然后又再次见到，开始怀疑这两个案件之间是否有关联。

'_Why would she turn up there and now again, is there a reason for it, is she connected with…'_  
'她为何会再次出现在那里，此刻？这其中有什么缘由吗，她与……'

She typed the name Shinji had gave her into the NERV system and waited for it to scan through, trying to remember anything else from the case which may have been of help, unfortunately nothing came to her straight away. After a few moments of waiting the search finished, pulling up no results.  
她将真嗣给她的名字输入 NERV 系统，等待扫描结果，试图回忆案件中任何可能有帮助的细节，遗憾的是，她一时想不起来。片刻等待后，搜索结束，没有找到任何结果。

'_What the hell, no one by that name. Ok, I'll just try Ayanami on its own'_  
'搞什么鬼，这个名字查无此人。好吧，我试试单独输入'绫波'看看'

She hastily typed Ayanami in and once again waited for a result, once again it came up as there was no one registered on the database under that name.  
她匆忙输入了'绫波'，再次等待结果，不出所料，数据库中依旧没有这个名字的注册记录。

'_That bitch gave him a fake name, how could we have been that stupid to believe her.'_  
'那个婊子给了他一个假名，我们怎么这么蠢，居然相信了她。'

She gently massaged her head trying to think of anything else to help them, so far since arriving here everything she had done had been of little to no help at all. Sure enough she had given advice on what to do next but the first case hadn't heralded any results and the previous case she was saved by Shinji. Now here she was unable to turn up anything, she slammed her good hand off the desk in frustration and picked up the phone to call Misato.  
她轻轻按摩着头部，试图想出其他办法来帮助他们。自从来到这里，她所做的一切几乎都没有什么帮助。当然，她给出了下一步该怎么做的建议，但第一个案子没有任何结果，之前的案子她被真嗣救了。现在，她一无所获，沮丧地用那只好手猛拍桌子，然后拿起电话打给美里。

'_This is pathetic how am I supposed to show I'm a good Agent if all that happens is I get rescued or find nothing'_  
'这太可悲了，如果每次都是被救或者一无所获，我怎么证明自己是个好特工？'

The phone rang for a few times and then Misato picked up on the other end.  
电话响了几声后，美里在另一端接了起来。

"_Hello."_ “你好。”

"Hi it's Agent Sohryu, I haven't been able to find anything on Miss Ayana… hold on a minute."  
“嗨，我是苏里尤特工，关于绫奈小姐的线索我还没找到……稍等一下。”

Asuka stared at the computer screen where it had previously said no results. "Found an item" had now appeared, it was a profile on one Rei Ayanami. She cautiously opened the record and began speaking again.  
明日香盯着电脑屏幕，那里之前显示的是“无结果”。现在却出现了“找到一项”，是一个关于绫波零的档案。她小心翼翼地打开记录，再次开口。

"…I don't know how but a record just appeared on her, I could have sworn that wasn't there before."  
“……我不知道怎么回事，她的记录突然出现了，我敢肯定之前那里没有的。”

"_Ok, what does it say?"_  
“好吧，上面写了什么？”

"Name Rei Ayanami, this can't be right the file is completely blank except for a name and a date of birth."  
"名字是绫波零，这不对劲，文件除了名字和出生日期外完全是空白的。"

"_Impossible."_ "不可能。"

"You don't have to tell me that, ok anyway name Rei Ayanami, birth date the twenty seventh of December, year two thousand, that's impossible the woman who attacked me was older then fifteen!"  
"你不用告诉我这个，好吧，名字是绫波零，出生日期是十二月二十七日，二千年，这不可能，袭击我的女人看起来比十五岁要大得多！"

"_I see, well we can't use that information so onto other things, the liquid samples, are they still there?"_  
"我明白了，那这条信息我们用不上，说说别的吧，那些液体样本还在吗？"

Asuka opened the drawer to try and find the records from the last Sachiel case only to remember what had happened to all the files from that night. She slammed for drawer shut and responded down the phone angrily.  
明日香打开抽屉试图找到上次与 Sachiel 案件相关的记录，却突然记起那一晚所有文件的遭遇。她愤怒地猛然关上抽屉，对着电话那头怒气冲冲地回应。

"I'm afraid not, they were stolen during the Sachiel case along with everything else to do with the case."  
"恐怕不在了，它们在 Sachiel 案件中被偷走了，连同案件相关的所有东西一起。"

There was a brief pause on the line as she waited for Misato to respond.  
电话那头短暂地沉默了，她等待着美里回应。

"_Stolen? Why was I not informed?"_  
“被盗了？为什么我没被告知？”

"It was before you arrived here, I was told that an internal investigation was ongoing but nothing seems to have been turned up from that."  
“那是在你来之前的事，我听说正在进行内部调查，但似乎什么也没查出来。”

"_I see, well we have two samples here so that's better than nothing, me and Agent Ikari will go to the labs to get them analyzed."_  
"我明白了，我们这里有两份样本，总比没有好。我和池田特工会去实验室进行分析。"

"Right, I'll meet you two down there."  
"好的，我会在下面和你们会合。"

**Labs – 1400 hours 实验室 – 14 点整**

Misato pulled up into the parking space and began to get out of the car, when she noticed Shinji had gone pale again. She put her hand on his shoulder and spoke to him softly.  
美里将车停进车位，正要下车时，注意到真嗣的脸色又变得苍白。她把手放在他的肩上，温柔地对他说。

"Shinji are you sure you're alright? You didn't have to come you know."  
“真嗣，你确定你没事吗？你知道的，你不必非得来的。”

"No it's alright I'm fine, it's just I forgot how bad of a driver you were. Give me a few minutes."  
“不，没事的，我很好，只是我忘了你开车有多糟糕。给我几分钟就好。”

Misato scowled and looked at him with a mock sad expression, he smiled slightly and made his way out of the car, making sure he had the two liquid samples. Misato was pleased to see he was at least looking better, she thought of him as if he was her own son so naturally she hated seeing him like he was earlier.  
美里皱着眉头，用一种假装悲伤的表情看着他，他微微一笑，走出车外，确保带上了那两份液体样本。美里看到他至少看起来好些了，心里感到欣慰，她把他当作自己的儿子一样，自然不喜欢看到他之前那副模样。

"Misato, where did Agent Sohryu say she'll be meeting us?"  
“美里，草薙少尉说她会在哪里和我们见面？”

"Inside the building, Shinji can you tell me more about the Sachiel case and the liquid you found there?"  
“在建筑物里面，真嗣，你能跟我详细说说关于萨基尔案件和你找到的那种液体吗？”

He paused for a moment, trying to remember the exact events and then began telling them to Misato.  
他停顿了一下，试图回忆确切的事件，然后开始向美里讲述。

"Someone sent me a package with case files for the children that were being murdered a few weeks ago, so I began digging into the NERV Archives and found a pattern dating back to about forty five years ago. We went to the crime scene of the latest victim and Agent Sohryu noticed something about the blood on the floor."  
有人寄给我一些关于几周前被谋杀的孩子们的案件文件，于是我开始深入研究 NERV 档案，发现了一个可以追溯到大约四十五年前的模式。我们去了最近受害者的犯罪现场，草薙特工注意到了地板上血迹的一些细节。

"What did she noticed?"  
她注意到了什么？

"It wasn't blood, it was something else, she went to get it analyzed but found nothing. Anyway on that night we went out to the lakes trying to find our suspect, you already know the rest."  
"那不是血，是别的什么东西，她拿去分析了却一无所获。总之，那天晚上我们去了湖边试图找到嫌疑人，剩下的你已经知道了。"

"So do you think what you found today is the same liquid?"  
"那你认为今天找到的液体是同一种吗？"

"Could be, but the records from last time were stolen by someone so we can't really be sure."  
"可能是，但上次的数据被人偷走了，所以我们无法确定。"

"If it is then what could it mean?"  
"如果是这样，那它可能意味着什么？"

"It means that somehow the cases are related, but how I don't know."  
"这意味着这些案件之间有某种联系，但我还不清楚具体是如何。"

"Any ideas?" "有什么想法吗？"

"Maybe some new sort of cult or something else entirely, but the appearance of the liquid and the blue haired girl make it look that way."  
"或许是某种新兴的邪教，或者其他完全不同的东西，但那种液体的出现和蓝发女孩的存在让人不得不这么联想。"

He finished speaking just as they got into the waiting room of the laboratories. Waiting for them was Asuka who had a stern expression on her face.  
他话音刚落，他们便进入了实验室的等候室。在那里，表情严肃的明日香正等着他们。

"I never thought I'd be this glad to see you both."  
"我从没想过自己会如此高兴见到你们俩。"

Shinji shot her a confused look and spoke.  
真嗣困惑地看了她一眼，开口说道。

"Huh, what do you mean?"  
“啊？你什么意思？”

"We have Doctor Pervert again."  
“我们又来了个变态博士。”

"Eh?"

"The guy who asked me out when he had his elbow wrist deep in human torso."  
"那个在我帮他把手肘深深埋进人体躯干时约我出去的家伙。"

Shinji tried to stop himself from laughing out loud, Misato however couldn't restrain herself and laughed loudly.  
真嗣试图忍住不笑出声，但美里却忍不住大声笑了起来。

"Well I'm not surprised someone as young and good looking as you is bound to attract attention from all sorts of people."  
"像你这么年轻又好看的人，吸引各种人的注意也不奇怪。"

Asuka gave Misato a glare of death for that comment and her next words stopped both Shinji and Misato's laughter dead.  
对于那番话，明日香向美里投去了一记死亡凝视，紧接着她的话语让真嗣和美里的笑声戛然而止。

"Oh, shut up." “哦，闭嘴。”

Misato put on a serious expression knowing how severe the situation was.  
美里摆出一副严肃的表情，深知情况的严重性。

"Ok, we're sorry, where is he?"  
“好的，我们很抱歉，他在哪儿？”

"Probably cutting someone up, he's gave us use of one of the labs, we can perform the tests there."  
“大概在解剖什么人吧，他给了我们一间实验室的使用权，我们可以在那里进行测试。”

The three of them made their way into one of the empty labs and Shinji handed the two samples over to Asuka who began to power up some of the machines in the labs. Shinji and Misato merely looked around confused as to what was happening, Asuka however felt immense pride at being able to do something they couldn't. She knew it was perhaps childish to feel it, but after her experiences so far it was great to actually be able to show off her own skills.  
三人走进一间空实验室，真嗣将两份样本递给明日香，她开始启动实验室里的机器。真嗣和美里只是困惑地环顾四周，不知道发生了什么，而明日香却感到无比自豪，因为她能做一些他们做不到的事情。她知道这种感觉可能有些幼稚，但经历了这么多之后，能够展示自己的技能真是太好了。

"This machine will analyze the liquid sample and compare it with the DNA profiles within the system, assuming this is DNA it should provide a match or at least a sense of what it's closest to."  
"这台机器将分析液体样本，并与系统内的 DNA 档案进行比对，假设这是 DNA，它应该能提供匹配结果，或者至少指出最接近的类型。"

Asuka fed the sample into the machine and then switched on an identical machine next to it and repeated the process with the second sample.  
明日香将样本送入机器，然后开启旁边一台相同的机器，用第二个样本重复了这一过程。

"I didn't know you were able to use all this stuff, Agent Sohryu."  
"我不知道你还能操作这些设备，草薙特工。"

"It's nothing complex Agent Ikari, but the results might be which is good that I'm here. As I said I trained as a Doctor at University in Germany."  
"这并不复杂，碇警官，但结果可能很复杂，幸好我在这里。正如我所说，我在德国的大学接受了医生的培训。"

"How come you joined NERV, then?"  
"那你为什么加入 NERV 呢？"

Asuka looked at him and shrugged her shoulders.  
明日香看着他，耸了耸肩。

"I don't know, when I left University I received an invitation to come to Japan and train for NERV. Obviously someone recognized my good work and decided I could do some good here, so I joined."  
"我不知道，当我离开大学时，我收到了来日本为 NERV 训练的邀请。显然有人认可了我的出色工作，并认为我在这里能有所作为，所以我加入了。"

She smiled as she gave her explanation, partly with arrogance and pride. She had always taken great pride in being the best she could at anything. She was quickly brought back down when Shinji asked his next question.  
她微笑着解释，带着几分傲慢和自豪。她总是以成为任何事情中的佼佼者为荣。但当真嗣提出下一个问题时，她很快就被拉回了现实。

"So what were you able to find about Rei Ayanami?"  
"那么，关于绫波零，你发现了什么？"

She scowled slightly and gave over the results of her search, it was a single document, no picture and only two lines of text.  
她微微皱眉，递上了搜索结果，那是一份单页文件，没有图片，仅有两行文字。

"Name Rei Ayanami, Date of Birth twenty seventh of December year two thousand, that's all the NERV Computers could find?"  
“姓名绫波零，出生日期为 2000 年 12 月 27 日，NERV 的电脑就只能查到这些？”

"Yes, it's like she doesn't exist."  
“是的，她仿佛不存在一般。”

"It might still mean something, the date is the same day as second impact."  
"日期与第二次冲击的同一天，或许这仍意味着什么。"

"What does second impact have to do with this?"  
"第二次冲击与这有何关联？"

"Nothing but we should still keep hold of it."  
"并无直接联系，但我们仍应保留它。"

"I don't see why, without any more information we have nothing to go on."  
"我不明白，没有更多信息，我们无从下手。"

"I think I might know where to find more information on her."  
"我想我知道哪里能找到更多关于她的信息。"

Misato stepped over to him and looked at him sternly.  
美里走到他身边，严厉地看着他。

"Shinji you're not thinking of…"  
"真嗣，你不会是想……"

"Yes, they're the only people who will be able to help."  
"是的，他们是我们唯一能求助的人。"

"Shinji, you're risking a lot if you involve them, if you do I can't get involved due to my position at NERV."  
"真嗣，如果你牵扯到他们，风险很大，而且由于我在 NERV 的职位，我无法介入。"

"I know that but I don't have a choice, besides they're my friends and I haven't seen them in a while, might be a good time to pay them a visit."  
"我知道这一点，但我别无选择，再说了，他们是我的朋友，我也很久没见他们了，或许现在是拜访他们的好时机。"

Asuka looked at them both, at first surprised at Shinji having friends and then even more so at Misato's reluctance to allow him to do whatever he had in mind.  
明日香看着他们俩，起初对真嗣有朋友感到惊讶，然后对美里不愿让他做他想做的事更加惊讶。

"Excuse me but, what are you talking about?"  
"不好意思，你们在说什么呢？"

"Two friends of mine, they should be able to find more on Miss Ayanami."  
"我有两个朋友，他们应该能找到更多关于绫波小姐的资料。"

"I see, well the machines should be finished by now."  
"我明白了，机器现在应该已经完成了。"

She walked over to the first machine and looked at the results, studying the only result on the page. She quickly put it down and moved onto the other machine only to find the same results.  
她走到第一台机器前，查看结果，仔细研究页面上唯一的结果。她迅速放下，转向另一台机器，却发现结果如出一辙。

"The liquids are identical, but according to these results there's only a minor deviation of that from human DNA."  
"这些液体完全相同，但根据这些结果显示，它们与人类 DNA 只有微小的偏差。"

**Suzahara Residence – 1630  
铃原宅邸 – 16:30**

"So who are these people exactly?"  
"那么这些人究竟是谁呢？"

Shinji turned to look at her and began explaining.  
真嗣转向她，开始解释道。

"Two friends of mine, I met them a couple of years ago. Touji Suzahara and Kensuke Aida. For lack of a better term they're computer geeks, well Kensuke is, Touji is more into athletics and such, he plays for a small time basketball team. They're conspiracy theorists but are also able to get any information you want."  
“我有两个朋友，几年前认识的。铃原冬二和相田剑介。说得好听点他们是电脑高手，其实剑介是，冬二更热衷于体育运动，他参加了一个小有名气的篮球队。他们热衷于阴谋论，但也能帮你获取任何想要的信息。”

"I see, and you think they'll be able to help us?"  
“我明白了，你觉得他们会帮到我们吗？”

"Maybe." "或许吧。"

Shinji knocked on the door and waited patiently for a response, he could hear movement from inside the apartment but no one near the door. He knocked again, this time calling through the door.  
真嗣敲了敲门，耐心等待回应，他能听到屋内的动静，但似乎没人靠近门口。他又敲了一次，这次对着门喊道。

"Touji, Kensuke open up, its Ikari."  
“阿薰，健介，开门，我是碇。”

They waited a few more moments and eventually the door crept open a small amount. Through the crack Shinji could see a young mans face with glasses and scruffy looking hair.  
他们又等了一会儿，最终门缓缓打开了一条缝。透过缝隙，真嗣看到一个戴着眼镜、头发凌乱的年轻男子面孔。

"Who's the woman?" "那个女人是谁？"

"That's Agent Sohryu, open the door Kensuke."  
"那是苏里乌特工，开门吧，健介。"

The door opened fully and the man quickly beckoned them in, closing the door behind him. Asuka turned to look and noticed the door had over five locks on it, she shot Shinji a confused look and he just shrugged.  
门完全打开了，那人迅速示意他们进来，随后关上了门。明日香转头一看，注意到门上装了不下五个锁，她疑惑地看了真嗣一眼，而他只是耸了耸肩。

'_These people are even weirder than Shinji, guess there is hope for my job yet.'_  
'这些人比真嗣还怪，看来我的工作还有救。'

The three of them made their way into the living area, or at least what was supposed to be the living area. It was more of a storing ground for spare computer parts and numerous amounts of wires.  
三人走进了所谓的起居区，或者说至少应该是起居区的地方。实际上，这里更像是一个存放备用电脑零件和大量电线的仓库。

"Hey Shinji, great to see you, who's the chick?"  
“嘿，真嗣，见到你真好，这姑娘是谁？”

They turned to look at where the voice had came from, Asuka was surprised at what she saw. Whereas Kensuke was probably an accurate portrayal of the geek stereotype this other guy seemed to be anything but, he was fairly athletic and quite well built, if anything Asuka would have thought he was an older version of the Jock stereotype. She was about to respond when she noticed both Kensuke and this other person staring at her.  
他们转身望向声音传来的方向，看到的一幕让明日香颇为惊讶。与可能完全符合书呆子刻板印象的真希波不同，这个新出现的家伙似乎截然相反，他相当健壮，体格匀称，如果非要说明日香的想法，她会觉得他更像是一个成熟版的运动员类型。正当她准备回应时，她注意到真希波和这个新来的人都盯着她看。

"What are you both staring at?"  
“你们俩在看什么？”

"Not..." “不是……”

She quickly held her suit jacket tighter around her.  
她迅速将西装外套裹得更紧了些。

"Perverts, maybe next time I should charge a viewing fee, Shinji who are these two stooges."  
“变态们，或许下次我该收观赏费，真嗣，这两位傻瓜是谁？”

"Hey, we asked first."  
“嘿，是我们先问的。”

Shinji interjected himself at this point.  
此时，真嗣插话进来。

"Calm down, we have a serious situation. Kensuke, Touji I need a favour from you. We're trying to track down a woman called Rei Ayanami we found no other details except date of birth which the document stated as the day of second impact."  
“冷静点，我们面临一个严重的情况。健介，阿薰，我需要你们帮忙。我们正在追踪一个叫绫波零的女人，除了她的生日，其他信息一无所知，文件上写的是第二次冲击那天。”

Kensuke took the sheet of paper from his hand and looked it over.  
健介从他手中接过那张纸，仔细查看。

"Okay, we can do that, when do you need it by?"  
"好的，我们可以做到，你什么时候需要？"

"Well now would be nice."  
"现在就不错。"

"Okay, sure thing, let me just take a look."  
"好的，没问题，让我看看。"

Asuka shot Shinji another confused look as they crowded around the computer. She was about to ask Shinji what was happening when she felt some ones hand on her shoulder. She turned and saw the grinning face of Touji. Without giving it a second thought she slapped him direct across the face. Shinji and Kensuke just looked on with amused looks on their faces.  
当他们围在电脑前时，明日香又向真嗣投去一个困惑的眼神。她正要问真嗣发生了什么事，却感觉到有人把手搭在了她的肩上。她转过身，看到了东治那张咧嘴笑的脸。她毫不犹豫地直接给了他一巴掌。真嗣和健介只是带着有趣的表情看着。

"Touch me again and next time I hit you somewhere more painful."  
“再碰我一下，下次我就打你更痛的地方。”

Kensuke tapped in a few commands on the keyboard and looked up. Asuka recognized immediately what he was doing, he was attempting to break into the government database. Not even she had access to that.  
健介在键盘上敲了几下命令，然后抬头看向明日香。她立刻认出了他在做什么，他正试图侵入政府数据库。连她自己都没有权限进入那个系统。

"Umm, what exactly are you doing?"  
"嗯，你到底在做什么？"

"I'm using a backdoor to get into the government database, don't worry, it's safe no one is ever watching this thing."  
"我在通过后门进入政府数据库，别担心，这很安全，从来没人监控这个东西。"

He tapped Rei's name and waited for it to search, after a short while a result was found. He opened the document and her records showed up, however before anyone could get a good look the screen changed with only the words "Access Denied" at the top and the strange seven eyed logo beneath it. Both Asuka and Shinji immediately recognized it as the one they had seen during the Sachiel case and again earlier that day.  
他点击了丽（Rei）的名字，等待搜索结果。不久，找到了相关记录。他打开文档，她的档案显示出来，但还没等任何人仔细查看，屏幕就变成了“访问被拒绝”的字样，下方是一个奇怪的七眼标志。明日香和真嗣立刻认出这是他们在萨基尔（Sachiel）事件中以及当天早些时候见过的标志。

"Kensuke, change of plan, get out of the system and instead I want you to find whatever you can on that logo. I think it's time for me and Agent Sohryu to pay some people a visit."  
"健介，计划变更，退出系统，我要你尽可能找到关于那个标志的一切。我想是时候我和草薙特工去拜访一些人了。"

He gave Asuka a knowing look and she spoke verifying they were thinking the same thing.  
他给了明日香一个心领神会的眼神，她开口确认他们想到一块儿去了。

"You mean the facility we were in a few weeks ago."  
"你是说我们几周前待过的那个设施。"

"Yes, I think that's where our guy is heading to."  
“是的，我想那就是我们的人要去的地方。”

**Restricted Facility – 1015 hours  
限制区域 – 10 点 15 分**

The exterior of the building was just as Asuka remembered it, on the wall the same seven eyed logo was there and the entrance just a few meters away. Something seemed different about it though, there was no security guard outside and no light from the facility.  
建筑的外部正如 Asuka 记忆中的那样，墙上的七眼标志依旧存在，入口也仅在几米之外。但有些地方似乎不同了，外面没有保安，也没有来自设施的灯光。

'_Maybe they all went home for the night.'_  
'也许他们都回家过夜了。'

Both herself and Shinji exited the car and made their way over to the entrance and peered inside, there was no light from the corridor and no sounds at all from inside. Shinji nervously pulled out his torch and shone it inside. Inside he could make out a broken trolley and various boxes. He turned around and spoke to Asuka.  
她和真嗣都下了车，走向入口处，向内窥视，走廊里没有灯光，里面也没有任何声音。真嗣紧张地拿出手电筒，照向里面。他能看到里面有一辆损坏的推车和各种箱子。他转过身来对明日香说。

"There doesn't seem to be anyone in there, do you think they knew we'd come back?"  
“里面似乎没有人，你觉得他们知道我们会回来吗？”

"No idea, lets take a look inside, you head straight down I'll check the other labs."  
"不知道，我们进去看看吧，你直接往下走，我去检查其他实验室。"

"Ok, sure." "好的，没问题。"

They both made their way into the facility, Asuka pulled out her torch and turned off down the other corridor, leaving Shinji to explore more. He slowly made his way up the corridor, being as silent and cautious as he could just in case there was someone still there. Something about this whole thing wasn't adding up, a few weeks ago this was a fully functional facility and now it was practically abandoned.  
他们两人进入了设施内部，明日香拿出手电筒，转身走向另一条走廊，留下真嗣继续探索。他小心翼翼地沿着走廊前行，尽可能保持安静和谨慎，以防万一还有人在这里。整个情况有些不对劲，几周前这里还是一个完全运作的设施，现在却几乎被遗弃了。

'_Why would they abandon it like this, do they know something we don't?'_  
“他们为何会如此仓促地遗弃这里，难道知道些什么我们不知道的？”

He slowly made his way down a set of stairs and into another laboratory. The lab was huge, towards the center were a bed and a set of drawers. However around this were shelves that appeared to have been emptied in a hurry. On the floor was a strange symbol that Shinji did not recognize. He made his way over to the set of drawers, finding only a set of tablets and a card on it. Shining the light on the card he was shocked to find it belonged to the person they had came here in search of.  
他缓缓走下一组楼梯，进入另一个实验室。这个实验室非常庞大，中心位置有一张床和一组抽屉。然而，四周的架子似乎在匆忙中被清空了。地板上有一个真嗣不认识的奇怪符号。他走向那组抽屉，只发现里面有一套平板电脑和一张卡片。他用手电筒照亮卡片，震惊地发现它属于他们此行寻找的那个人。

'_Rei Ayanami? She was here, hold on a minute what is this?'_  
“绫波零？她曾在这里，等等，这是什么？”

Next to the card was another ID Card, once again belonging to Rei, only this time it was not a generic card but a NERV ID.  
卡片旁边还有一张身份证，同样属于丽，但这次不是普通卡片，而是一张 NERV 的 ID 卡。

'_She's in NERV?'_ '她在 NERV 里？'

He pocketed the card and moved on further into the lab, now he found himself in a huge open space, on the floor he noticed the same liquid they had discovered earlier on. He bent down to examine it and just as he did the lights in the laboratory went on.  
他将卡片放入口袋，继续深入实验室，发现自己来到了一个巨大的开放空间，地板上他注意到了之前发现的那种液体。他弯腰检查时，实验室的灯光突然亮了起来。

"So you're who they've chosen."  
"原来你就是他们选中的那个人。"

He looked up to find himself looking at another man, he immediately knew who the person was.  
他抬头一看，发现自己正面对着另一个男人，他立刻认出了对方是谁。

"Shamshel…" "沙姆谢尔…"

"So they told you the name they gave me, I see. Yes Agent Ikari I am the person they called Shamshel."  
"看来他们告诉了你他们给我的名字。是的，碇警官，我就是他们口中的沙姆谢尔。"

"What is this place and who are you talking about?"  
"这是什么地方，你在说谁？"

"This is one of their labs, this is where I was created, this is where you were given your power."  
"这是他们的实验室之一，我在这里被创造，你在这里被赋予了力量。"

"What power? I don't understand."  
"什么力量？我不明白。"

"You are their latest plaything, they're using you just as they used me. They're going to use you and the female to hunt us and kill us."  
"你是他们最新的玩物，他们利用你就像利用我一样。他们会利用你和那个女人来追捕我们并杀死我们。"

"Who's using us?" "谁在利用我们？"

Shamshel laughed. 沙姆谢尔笑了。

"The people I came here to kill are, but seeing as you found me I guess I will not get to."  
“我来这里要杀的人是，但既然你找到了我，我想我是没机会了。”

Shinji stepped forward, pointing his gun directly at the man called Shamshel.  
真嗣向前一步，将枪直接对准了被称为沙姆谢尔的男人。

"I have no idea who you're talking about but I have no intention of letting you kill anyone."  
"我不知道你在说谁，但我绝不会让你杀任何人。"

"I know you don't, that is why you're going to kill me before I get a chance to."  
"我知道你不会，所以你要在我有机会之前杀了我。"

"You're insane, why would I kill you?"  
"你疯了吧，我为什么要杀你？"

"Because that is what you have been chosen to do, you are the hunter and we are your prey, Evangelion."  
"因为那是你被选中的使命，你是猎人，而我们是你追捕的猎物，福音战士。"

"Evangelion?" "福音战士？"

Shamshel looked at him and studied him closely, his face breaking into a twisted grin when he realized something about Shinji.  
夏姆榭尔盯着他，仔细打量，当意识到关于真嗣的某些事情时，他的脸扭曲成一个狡黠的笑容。

"I see, you know nothing, he has chosen to keep you in the dark. I must say you look like him."  
"我明白了，你一无所知，他选择让你蒙在鼓里。我得说，你看起来很像他。"

"Look like who?" "像谁？"

"Your father." "你的父亲。"

Something inside Shinji snapped when he heard those words, he started shouting.  
听到这些话，真嗣内心有什么东西崩断了，他开始大喊大叫。

"My father? What the hell do you know about him?"  
“我的父亲？你到底知道他什么？”

Shamshel merely laughed and stepped forward towards Shinji, as he did Shinji slowly began to back away and unloaded two shots. The bullets merely deflected off of some sort of forcefield in front of him.  
沙姆谢尔只是笑了笑，向前迈了一步，真嗣见状慢慢后退，并开了两枪。子弹只是被某种力场弹开了。

"This is pathetic, they sent you after me and it hasn't even taken effect yet, maybe I was wrong to expect death"  
“这太可悲了，他们派你来追杀我，效果却还没显现，或许我本就不该期待死亡。”

Shinji found himself looking around for somewhere to move to but it was too late, Shamshel grabbed him and punched him, the force of the blow sending him backwards onto the floor. Shinji got to his feet and fired more shots, each of them deflecting off of Shamshel's field. He watched helplessly as Shelshel's arm began to glow a bright orange color and then struck him again. This time the force sent him further back along the floor, he cried out in pain as he felt himself slamming against a shelving unit.  
真嗣发现自己四处寻找躲避之处，但为时已晚，沙姆谢尔抓住他并给了他一拳，强大的冲击力将他击倒在地。真嗣站起身来，继续开枪射击，但每一发子弹都被沙姆谢尔的力场弹开。他无助地看着沙姆谢尔的手臂开始发出明亮的橙色光芒，然后再次击中他。这一次的力量将他更远地击退，他痛苦地喊出声来，感觉自己猛地撞上了一个货架。

He tried to pull himself up and looked around for anything he could find, hearing Shamshel moving towards him again. Suddenly everything went black, Shinji tried moving around for anything, finding only darkness. He spat up blood onto his hand and felt anger rising up inside him. His vision came back as he saw Shamshel moving towards him again, Shamshel brought his arm back to deliver the final blow but then the same field appeared in front of Shinji, deflecting the blow.  
他试图站起来，四处寻找任何可以利用的东西，听到沙姆谢尔再次向他逼近。突然间，一切都陷入了黑暗，真嗣试图移动寻找任何东西，却只发现了黑暗。他吐出一口血，血溅在手上，愤怒在心中升起。他的视线恢复时，看到沙姆谢尔再次向他逼近，沙姆谢尔挥动手臂准备给予致命一击，但就在这时，同样的力场出现在真嗣面前，挡下了这一击。

Unaware of what he was doing, Shinji reached for something on the shelf and grabbed hold of it. It was a knife, without even knowing what he was doing and in a blind rage he plunged the knife directly into Shamshel and screamed out. He held it there for some time and then slowly withdrew it, only to plunge it once again into Shamshel's torso, completely consumed by rage. Orange liquid splattered everywhere across the ground and a mixture of the liquid and pure red blood swept across the floor from where Shinji was repeatedly stabbing the man. After a few more strikes, Shinji slowly got to his feet and staggered across the floor, unsure of what he had just done. His shirt was stained with blood and he himself was bleeding heavily from his nose. He got back to the area where he found Rei's cards and vomited up orange liquid, before passing out once again.  
不知不觉中，真嗣伸手从架子上抓起某样东西。那是一把刀，他甚至不知道自己在做什么，在盲目的愤怒驱使下，他直接将刀刺入了沙姆谢尔，并尖叫起来。他握着刀在那里停留了一会儿，然后缓缓抽出，却又再次猛地刺入沙姆谢尔的胸膛，完全被愤怒吞噬。橙色的液体四处飞溅，混合着鲜红的血液从真嗣不断刺击的地方涌出，覆盖了地面。再刺了几下后，真嗣慢慢站起身，踉跄着走过地板，对自己刚刚的所作所为感到迷茫。他的衬衫沾满了血迹，自己鼻子里也流出了大量的血。他回到发现绫波卡片的地方，吐出了橙色的液体，随后再次昏迷过去。

### Chapter 7 Departure

_May 2015_ 4th **Hospital Waiting Room – 0415 hours**  
2015 年 5 月 第四医院候诊室 – 凌晨 04:15

Misato sighed as she sat inside the waiting room, in front of her an impatient Asuka stood holding a cup of coffee. They had both been there for hours, waiting for the doctors to allow them to see Shinji. Asuka silently gazed at Misato who was trying her hardest not to cry. She slowly walked over and sat down next to her, putting an arm around her. Asuka wasn't going to admit it outright but she was concerned about Shinji and what they had gotten themselves into.  
美里叹了口气，坐在候诊室里，在她面前站着不耐烦的明日香，手里拿着一杯咖啡。她们已经在这里等了几个小时，等待医生允许她们见真嗣。明日香默默地注视着美里，她正竭尽全力不让自己哭出来。她缓缓走过去，坐在美里旁边，伸出一只手臂搂住她。明日香不会直接承认，但她确实担心真嗣以及他们卷入的这一切。

"What the hell are those Doctors doing in there, he wasn't that badly injured when I found him."  
“那些医生到底在里面搞什么鬼，我找到他的时候他伤得没那么重。”

Misato looked up at her and spoke quietly.  
美里抬头看着她，轻声说道。

"I thought you said he was covered in blood when you found him."  
"我记得你说过发现他时他浑身是血。"

Asuka frowned slightly recalling the moment she found Shinji, she had entered the lab area and found him collapsed near the staircase covered in blood, with a knife near his body. At first she thought someone had killed him but when she examined him a bit closer she found out it wasn't his blood and he wasn't wounded except for a few blows to the head. The strange thing was that there was no trace of the person who's blood it was anywhere around.  
明日香微微皱眉，回忆起发现真嗣的那一刻。她走进实验室区域，发现他倒在楼梯旁，浑身是血，身边还有一把刀。起初她以为有人杀了他，但仔细检查后发现那些血并非他的，除了头部几处打击伤外，他并未受伤。奇怪的是，周围没有任何属于血液主人的痕迹。

"He was… but it wasn't his blood."  
"他确实浑身是血… 但那不是他的血。"

"I see." “我明白了。”

Asuka felt Misato jerk slightly and she increased her grip on the woman. As she felt Misato crying silently she felt a pang of jealousy as she realized how much Misato truly cared for Shinji and how this was affecting her. It was something Asuka had never known, she had always maintained a distance with people and always kept an attitude of independence, not wanting to rely on anyone else, yet she couldn't help but be envious of the bond Misato and Shinji had.  
明日香感觉到美里微微一颤，她便更紧地抓住了这位女性。当她察觉到美里无声哭泣时，心中涌起了一股嫉妒，她意识到美里对真嗣的关心有多深，以及这件事对她的影响有多大。这是明日香从未经历过的，她总是与人保持距离，始终保持着独立的态度，不愿依赖任何人，但她不禁羡慕美里和真嗣之间的纽带。

"He'll be alright, the sight of the blood probably made the idiot pass out."  
“他会没事的，看到血估计就把那傻瓜吓晕了。”

It wasn't the best thing she could have said to ease the situation but it got a smile out of Misato.  
这虽不是最能缓和气氛的话，但却让美里露出了微笑。

"Yeah probably, I should probably try not to worry so much."  
"嗯，大概吧，我应该试着不要太担心。"

Asuka released her arm from around the woman and allowed her to dry her eyes, she then stood up and leaned against the wall opposite the seating. She glanced around and noticed something about the hospital.  
明日香松开了环绕在女子手臂上的手，让她擦干眼泪，然后站起身来，靠在对面的墙上。她环顾四周，注意到了医院的一些情况。

"It's awfully quiet isn't it, for a hospital?"  
"这里安静得过分了，对医院来说是不是太安静了？"

"What do you mean?"  
"你这是什么意思？"

"Aside from the Doctors and the crew who brought us in I haven't seen anyone else here, not even other patients."  
"除了带我们进来的医生和船员，我还没在这里见过其他人，连其他病人都没有。"

"It's early in the morning."  
"现在还是清晨。"

"I suppose, just seemed a bit strange, probably from the lack of sleep."  
"我想也是，只是觉得有点奇怪，大概是因为缺觉吧。"

"You don't have to stay, Agent Sohryu."  
"你不必留在这里，苏里玉探员。"

"No I do, I want to know what happened to him, besides I can catch up on sleep tomorrow at the office. I'll let him write all the reports."  
"不，我必须留下，我想知道他发生了什么事，而且我明天可以在办公室补觉。我会让他写所有的报告。"

"That's not really very appropriate."  
"这确实不太合适。"

"I know but I did them the last time so it's about time he done some paperwork, and I need rest."  
"我知道，但上次是我做的，这次该轮到他处理文书工作了，我需要休息。"

Misato laughed at Asuka's words, it was the first time she had been able to genuinely smile all night. Just at that moment a Doctor finally appeared and started walking towards them both. Asuka frowned as she noticed something on the man's coat that looked remarkably similar to the seven eyed logo she had seen previously. She tried to get a second look but the logo had gone.  
美里听到明日香的话笑了起来，这是她整晚第一次由衷地微笑。就在这时，一名医生终于出现并向她们走来。明日香皱起眉头，注意到这个男人外套上的图案与她之前见过的七眼标志惊人地相似。她试图再看一眼，但那个标志已经不见了。

'_Strange, must be seeing things, probably from lack of sleep and too much coffee.'_  
'奇怪，一定是看错了，可能是因为睡眠不足和咖啡喝多了。'

"Agent Sohryu, Agent Katsuragi, we've finished looking over Mr. Ikari. You'll be pleased to know he's fine and ready to be sent home. I'll take you to his room now, sorry for the wait."  
"草薙特工，葛城特工，我们已经完成了对碇先生的检查。你们会很高兴知道他一切都好，可以回家了。我现在带你们去他的房间，抱歉让你们久等了。"

"Its fine, we're just glad he's alright. Agent Sohryu are you coming?"  
"没关系，我们只是很高兴他没事。草薙特工，你要一起来吗？"

"Of course." “当然可以。”

They quietly followed the doctor through the hospital corridor and towards Shinji's room. As they made their way there, Asuka noticed that there was still no one around, it was almost as if, except for them, there were no other people in the hospital. They rounded the corner to Shinji's room and standing outside his room were two more people. The first was another doctor but the second interested Asuka, the thing that struck her was his resemblance to Shinji. He had tattered brown hair and a beard. The man was wearing a Blue military type uniform that was opened, revealing a red shirt. His eyes quickly locked with Asuka's and then looked away again. As their eyes locked, Asuka felt a chill run down her spine, whoever the man was he was intimidating, even to her. Eventually they reached the room and the man spoke to the doctor who had lead them there.  
他们静静地跟着医生穿过医院走廊，前往真嗣的房间。在前往的路上，明日香注意到周围依然空无一人，仿佛除了他们，医院里再无其他人的存在。他们转过拐角来到真嗣的房间前，那里站着另外两个人。一个是另一位医生，但第二个引起了明日香的注意，让她印象深刻的是他与真嗣的相似之处。他有着凌乱的棕色头发和胡须，身穿一件敞开的蓝色军用制服，露出里面的红色衬衫。他的目光迅速与明日香对上，然后又移开了。当他们的目光交汇时，明日香感到一股寒意沿着脊背而下，无论这个男人是谁，他都令人感到威胁，甚至对她来说也是如此。最终他们到达了房间，那个男人对带领他们的医生说话了。

"Who are these people?"  
"这些人是谁？"

"Agents Katsuragi and Sohryu, they're the ones who brought Agent Ikari in, Mr. Rokubungi."  
"Katsuragi 和 Sohryu 特工，是他们把 Ikari 特工带来的，Rokubungi 先生。"

"I see, very well, let them in."  
"明白了，很好，让他们进来。"

"Yes sir." "是的，长官。"

The doctor opened the door and allowed Misato and Asuka into the room, as they got in they saw Shinji standing up, finishing putting on a new jacket. He saw them both and smiled awkwardly. Immediately, Misato went over to him and pulled him into a huge hug, as she did so he yelped out in pain.  
医生打开门，让美里和明日香进入房间。他们进去时，看到真嗣正站起来，正穿上一件新夹克。他看到她们俩，尴尬地笑了笑。美里立刻走过去，将他紧紧拥入怀中，他疼得叫了一声。

"Misato…" "美里……"

"Oh sorry Shinji, guess I got a bit carried away."  
"哦，抱歉，真嗣，我有点太激动了。"

"It's alright, how are you two?"  
"没关系，你们俩还好吗？"

"Worried about you, what happened down there?"  
"担心你呢，下面发生了什么？"

Shinji frowned and looked down at the floor, thinking about how to phrase this best.  
真嗣皱了皱眉，低头看着地板，思考着如何最好地表达这一点。

"I... don't remember, I remember going down into that lab and then that guy Shamshel was there and he attacked me, but everything after that is a blank."  
“我……不记得了，我只记得走进那个实验室，然后那个叫沙姆谢尔的家伙在那里，他攻击了我，但那之后的一切都是一片空白。”

"I see, so how are you feeling?"  
“我明白了，那你现在感觉如何？”

"I'm in a bit of pain but I should be alright, at least we didn't come away with nothing. I found something down there that might be of interest, it's regarding our mystery female."  
"我有点疼，但应该没事，至少我们没白跑一趟。我在下面找到了一些可能感兴趣的东西，是关于我们那位神秘女性的。"

Shinji went over to his old, blood stained jacket and pulled out the NERV ID Card he had found earlier in the evening belonging to Rei. He handed it over to Misato.  
真嗣走到他那件沾满血迹的旧夹克旁，掏出了当晚早些时候找到的属于绫波的 NERV 身份证。他把它递给了美里。

"What do you think?"  
"你觉得呢？"

Misato looked it over and then handed it back to Shinji, with a confused look.  
美里仔细看了看，然后带着困惑的表情将它递还给真嗣。

"It's authentic, whoever she is she works for or, at least did work for NERV."  
“这是真的，不管她是谁，她为 NERV 工作，或者至少曾经为 NERV 工作过。”

Asuka walked over and snatched the card out of Shinji's hand.  
明日香走过来，从真嗣手中一把夺过卡片。

"That bitch works for NERV, then what the hell was she doing attacking me and why was her ID in that place. Could she have been working with the other guy?"  
"那个婊子为 NERV 工作，那她到底为什么要攻击我，还有她的 ID 卡怎么会出现在那里。她会不会是和另一个家伙一伙的？"

Shinji took the card back and shrugged his shoulders.  
真嗣拿回卡片，耸了耸肩。

"I don't know, she wasn't there last night, I'm certain of that. What happened to Shamshel?"  
"我不知道，她昨晚肯定不在那里。沙姆谢尔怎么了？"

Asuka and Misato looked at each other, wondering how to answer his question.  
明日香和美里互相对视，思索着如何回答他的问题。

"Well Shinji when…" “好吧，真嗣，当……”

Asuka interrupted her and took over.  
明日香打断了她，接过了话头。

"When I found you there was no sign of him, I only found you."  
"当我找到你时，他已不见踪影，我只找到了你。"

"I see, so we're no nearer to solving it than we were before we went in there?"  
"我明白了，这么说我们进去之前和现在一样，都没能解决这个问题？"

"No, that's the thing you see. Shortly before I contacted Misato to tell her about you she got a phone call from the Director, telling her to congratulate us on the successful capture of Shamshel."  
"不，问题就在这里。在我联系美里告诉她关于你的事情之前不久，她接到了总监的电话，让她祝贺我们成功捕获了夏姆谢尔。"

"How could we of captured him if we don't even know what happened? We don't even have a body."  
"如果我们连发生了什么都不知道，怎么可能抓到他？我们甚至连尸体都没有。"

"I asked the same thing, but we've been assured the case is closed."  
"我也问过同样的问题，但他们保证案件已经结了。"

Shinji glared at her, wondering if this was some sort of joke, or even a dream that he was going to wake up from any minute from now. The uneasy silence was cut off by Asuka speaking.  
真嗣瞪着她，怀疑这是不是某种玩笑，甚至是一场他随时会醒来的梦。不安的沉默被明日香打破。

"What are we going to do about 'Agent' Ayanami then?"  
"关于'特工'绫波，我们该怎么办？"

"I don't know, we'll see what we can find tomorrow, I just want to go home at the moment."  
"我不知道，明天看看能找到什么线索吧，我现在只想回家。"

Asuka frowned and accepted the answer not really wanting to go much further as she too wanted to go home and get some sleep, she did however ask the other question that was currently on her mind.  
明日香皱了皱眉，接受了回答，她其实也不想再深入讨论，因为她同样想回家好好睡一觉。不过，她还是问出了目前盘旋在心头的另一个问题。

"Shinji, who was that brown haired man who was outside your room earlier?"  
"真嗣，刚才在你房间外的那位棕发男子是谁？"

"You mean the military uniform style one? No idea, he said his name was Gendo Rokubungi, seemed to be in charge of this place or something."  
"你是说穿军装风格的那位吗？不知道，他说他叫源堂·六分仪，看起来像是这个地方的负责人之类的。"

_11th May 2015 2015 年 5 月 11 日_

**NERV Offices – 1015 hours  
NERV 总部 —— 10 点 15 分**

A week had passed since the Shamshel incident and progress had slowed in the offices. Both Shinji and Asuka had been given the week off strangely enough and weren't even required to submit reports on the case. An act which Shinji found very bizarre, especially considering NERV was usually very heavy on paperwork. However, despite being bizarre, it was also a relief for Shinji who never liked filing paperwork anyway. Shinji did not, however like the idea of taking the week off, so instead he spent the time searching through NERV trying to find any and all details of Rei Ayanami.  
沙姆沙尔事件已经过去一周，办公室里的进展却放缓了。奇怪的是，真嗣和明日香都被安排了一周的假期，甚至不需要提交案件报告。真嗣觉得这非常古怪，尤其是考虑到 NERV 通常对文书工作要求严格。然而，尽管古怪，这对真嗣来说也是一种解脱，因为他本来就不喜欢处理文书。不过，真嗣并不喜欢休假的想法，所以他选择利用这段时间在 NERV 内部搜寻关于绫波零的所有细节。

He was still clueless as to how nothing could be found on her, if it wasn't for the card and the fact that he had seen her she may as well have not existed. The only thing Shinji had thought of was that her records had been wiped and she had been assigned to observe over the two cases, but if that was the case then why did she attack them? He finished reading through a set of files before slipping them back into a folder and slapping them down on his desk, much to the annoyance of Asuka who had been watching him dedicate a week of his life to what she had deemed a pointless search.  
他仍然困惑于为何关于她的信息一无所获，如果不是那张卡片和她确实存在的证据，她简直就像从未存在过一样。真嗣唯一能想到的是，她的记录被抹除了，并且她被指派来监视这两个案件，但如果真是这样，那她为什么要攻击他们呢？他读完了一叠文件，将它们塞回文件夹，重重地拍在桌上，这让一直在旁观察他浪费一周时间进行无谓搜索的明日香感到十分恼火。

"Ikari, will you stop doing that or I'm going to come over there and shove those files in a very painful place."  
"碇，你能不能别再那样了，不然我可要过去把这些文件塞到一个非常痛的地方了。"

"Sorry, it's just frustrating, it's like she doesn't exist. Or she did exist and then they wiped out everything about her."  
"抱歉，只是觉得很沮丧，就好像她根本不存在一样。或者说她曾经存在过，然后他们抹去了关于她的一切。"

"Who are 'they'?" "‘他们’是谁？"

"I don't know, whoever she is with."  
"我不知道，她跟谁在一起。"

Asuka shook her head and went back to her computer screen.  
明日香摇了摇头，回到她的电脑屏幕前。

"Maybe she's with those aliens you believe in and she's observing us."  
"也许她跟你相信的那些外星人在一起，正在观察我们呢。"

"Agent Sohryu isn't there just a minute chance you could open your mind a bit, I mean considering what you have seen, don't you have to admit there is a slight chance?"  
"草薙特工，你就不能稍微敞开心扉一点吗？我是说，考虑到你所见过的那些事，难道你不觉得存在一丝可能性吗？"

"Nope, don't get me wrong I've seen some strange things Ikari, but aliens are still a bit farfetched for me. Now bring me one and I'll reconsider, but until then they're about as nonexistent as the records of Rei Ayanami."  
"不，别误会，我确实见过一些奇怪的事情，碇。但外星人对我来说还是太牵强了。现在你给我带一个来，我会重新考虑，但在那之前，他们就像绫波零的记录一样不存在。"

"So you're giving up on finding Rei as well."  
"所以你也在寻找绫波这件事上放弃了。"

"Are you stupid? Of course not, when I find that blue haired bitch I'm going to hurt her, but she has a habit of finding us."  
"你傻吗？当然不是，等我找到那个蓝毛婊子，我会让她吃点苦头，但她总是能找到我们。"

Just at that moment Misato stuck her head into the office and spoke out loudly.  
就在这时，美里探头进办公室，大声说道。

"I think Agent Sohryu might be onto something, I just received another package from the Director. He's given you another assignment and a surprise."  
"我觉得苏里尤·索鲁可能有点眉目了，我刚收到局长寄来的另一个包裹。他给你又安排了一个任务，还有个惊喜。"

Shinji looked up and frowned.  
真嗣抬头，皱起了眉。

"A surprise?" “一个惊喜？”

Misato walked in clutching a folder, she handed it to Shinji who began to read through it.  
美里拿着一个文件夹走了进来，她递给真嗣，后者开始翻阅起来。

"Agents Ikari and Ayanami? What is this some kind of joke?"  
"碇源堂和绫波零特工？这是在开什么玩笑吗？"

Misato glanced at him.  
美里瞥了他一眼。

"That's what I thought, but just like the ID card it's authentic, Agent Ayanami has been assigned to work with you and Agent Sohryu."  
"我一开始也这么想，但就像那张身份证一样，这是真的。绫波零特工已被指派与你和惣流特工合作。"

Asuka quickly walked over and snatched the case files.  
明日香快步走过去，一把夺过案件文件。

"What is this trash, Agent Ayanami? The same Agent Ayanami who…"  
“这是什么垃圾，绫波零特工？就是那个……”

"..attacked you? Yes, I don't like the idea of it anymore then you do. It's like we're being kept in the dark about everything. Fortunately for you and possibly her you won't be here when she arrives."  
“……攻击你的那个？是的，我对此也不再有好感，就像我们被蒙在鼓里一样。幸运的是，你和她可能都不会在这里见到她了。”

"What do you mean I won't be here, I thought she was being assigned to work with Agent Ikari and Agent Sohryu?"  
"你什么意思，我以为她是要和碇警官、惣流警官一起工作？"

"Yes she is, but you've been given a special assignment."  
"没错，但她有特殊任务。"

"What is it?" “怎么了？”

Misato handed her a second folder and Asuka began reading through the case files, immediately after she started a smile crept up onto her face and Misato noticed her begin to blush slightly.  
美里递给她第二个文件夹，明日香开始翻阅案件资料，刚一打开，她的脸上就浮现出笑容，美里注意到她的脸颊微微泛红。

"Agent Sohryu, are you alright?"  
"草薙特工，你还好吗？"

"I'm fine, it's just this special assignment really lives up to it's name. I'm working with an old friend of mine, well I say friend, he sort of looked after me a bit when I was younger and lived in Germany."  
"我没事，只是这个特殊任务确实名副其实。我和一个老朋友一起工作，虽然我说是朋友，但他有点像在我年轻时住在德国时照顾过我。"

Misato grinned at her and replied teasingly.  
美里笑着对她打趣道。

"Oh really, who is it?"  
"哦，真的吗？是谁？"

"Agent Ryojii Kaji" "碇源堂特工"

Upon hearing those words Misato's face dropped and Shinji looked up.  
听到这个名字，美里脸色一沉，真嗣抬头望去。

"Hey isn't that the guy wh..."  
"嘿，那不是那个谁...吗？"

"Shut up Shinji." "闭嘴，真嗣。"

Asuka looked at them, confused.  
明日香看着他们，一脸困惑。

"What is it?" “怎么了？”

"Oh Misato used to da..."  
"哦，美里以前常……"

"Shinji I'm warning you shut up, it's nothing Asuka, have a nice time with that jerk. Sorry did I say jerk I meant asshole, oh no there I go again."  
"真嗣，我警告你闭嘴，没什么大不了的，明日香，和那个混蛋好好玩吧。抱歉，我说混蛋了吗？我指的是混账，哦不，我又说错了。"

Asuka laughed. 明日香笑了。

"Oh, so you used to date him."  
"哦，这么说你以前和他交往过。"

"Date, no I didn't date him, it was a fling many years ago, no big deal."  
"交往？不，我没和他正式交往，只是多年前的一段短暂恋情，没什么大不了的。"

"I see, well I'll be sure to tell him you said hello."  
"我明白了，那我会转告他你问好。"

"Tell him whatever you like, does it say what the assignment is?"  
"告诉他你喜欢的任何事，上面有写任务内容吗？"

"No, it just says I'll be meeting with Agent Kaji and he'll give me the necessary information."  
"没有，只说我会和凯吉特工见面，他会给我必要的信息。"

Shinji frowned slightly and spoke again.  
真嗣微微皱眉，再次开口。

"NERV seems to like not giving us any information, what are they trying to hide."  
"NERV 似乎喜欢不给我们任何信息，他们到底想隐瞒什么。"

"Oh please, it's just the way this place operates, don't start with the conspiracy theories just yet Ikari"  
"哦拜托，这里就是这样运作的，别急着开始阴谋论，碇。"

"Sorry I just thought it was a bit strange."  
"抱歉，我只是觉得有点奇怪。"

"Yes it is, but I'm sure they have a good reason for it. In the meantime I had better get going, my plane leaves in two hours according to this."  
"是的，但我想他们一定有充分的理由。与此同时，我最好动身了，根据这个，我的飞机两小时后起飞。"

She checked over the documents again, making sure that was indeed what it said, then she looked around the office again. Even though she knew she would be back it was a strange feeling leaving the place for another assignment just a few weeks after she had arrived here. Although she still wasn't too struck on the idea of working here, she had begun to warm up to the place and was beginning to think of it as her permanent location. It was a job where she was able to show off her talent and prove how good of an agent she was.  
她再次检查了文件，确认无误后，又环顾了一遍办公室。尽管她知道自己很快就会回来，但离开这里去执行另一个任务的感觉依然很奇怪，毕竟她才刚到这里几周。虽然她对在这里工作并不十分热衷，但她已经开始对这个地方产生好感，并开始将其视为自己的永久驻地。这是一份能让她展示才华、证明自己优秀特工身份的工作。

'_I'll be back in no time, in fact it won't even feel like I've gone'_  
'我很快就会回来，实际上，离开的时间甚至不会让人感觉我曾离开过'

Her thoughts were interrupted by Misato pulling her into a hug.  
她的思绪被美里拉进怀抱的动作打断了。

"Agen... Asuka, thanks for what you did a week ago and good luck. You had better be back soon."  
“阿绫……明日香，谢谢你一周前所做的一切，祝你好运。你最好尽快回来。”

Asuka smiled at her and replied.  
明日香对她微笑着回答。

"Don't worry this'll be over in no time, I'll be back before you know it. Probably be back in time to help you and Agent Ikari."  
"别担心，这很快就会结束的，我马上就回来。说不定还能赶回来帮你和碇特工。"

She turned just in time and Shinji stepped forward and outstretched his hand.  
她及时转身，真嗣向前一步，伸出了手。

"Agent Sohryu thank you and goodbye."  
"绫波特工，谢谢你，再见。"

"Getting a little sentimental are we, Shinji?"  
"有点多愁善感了，是吗，真嗣？"

She grabbed hold of his hand and pulled him into a hug, much to his surprise.  
她抓住他的手，将他拉进一个拥抱，让他大吃一惊。

"Keep chasing those aliens for me Shinji, and remember if you do catch one I want to see it."  
"继续为我追逐那些外星人吧，真嗣，记住，如果你真的抓到了一个，我可是想亲眼看看的。"

_12th May 2015 2015 年 5 月 12 日_

**NERV Offices – 1125 hours  
NERV 总部办公室 – 11 时 25 分**

Misato stepped into the office and looked around, it was so lifeless now that Asuka had left and that had only been one day ago. She looked around and saw the reason why it was so lifeless, there was no one here. Not only was Asuka's side of the office empty for obvious reasons but Shinji's side was also abandoned, except there seemed to be an unusual amount up of files on his desk.  
美里踏进办公室，环顾四周，自从明日香离开后，这里变得如此死气沉沉，而那仅仅是昨天的事。她四处张望，发现这里空无一人，这便是原因所在。不仅明日香那边因为显而易见的原因空着，真嗣那边也同样无人，只是他的桌上似乎堆了异常多的文件。

'_Oh for crying out loud, he didn't.'_  
'哦，拜托，他没有。'

She stepped over to the pile of papers and sure enough, behind them all was Shinji, sleeping with his head resting on the desk. Misato glared at him and picked up one of the biggest files she could find and hit him directly on the head with it. He woke with a jolt and looked directly into her eyes.  
她走过去，果然，在那一堆文件后面，真嗣正趴在桌上睡着。美里瞪了他一眼，拿起一个最大的文件夹，直接朝他的头砸去。他猛地惊醒，直视着她的眼睛。

"Shinji, have you been here all night?"  
“真嗣，你在这里待了一整晚吗？”

"Yes." "是的。"

"Sohryu is right, you are an idiot, why were you here all night?"  
"惣流说得对，你真是个白痴，为什么在这里熬了一整夜？"

"Something didn't make sense about the last few cases so I looked over the reports and profiles, Sachiel, Shamshel, Rei Ayanami, the seven eyed logo, I even looked up Gendo Rokubungi."  
"最近几起案件有些不对劲，所以我重新审视了报告和档案，萨基尔、夏姆谢尔、绫波零，那个七眼标志，我甚至还查了碇源堂。"

"And did you find anything?"  
"那你发现了什么吗？"

"No nothing of use, either nothing or in Gendo Rokubungi's case a profile and a mention of the hospital he is in charge of, but besides that nothing at all."  
"没有任何有用的信息，要么是毫无线索，要么就是像源堂·六分仪那样，只有一份档案和他负责的医院提及，除此之外一无所获。"

"Well today is the day Agent Ayanami arrives, so I'm giving you permission to go home and clean yourself up for her arrival."  
"今天绫波零特工会抵达，所以我特许你回家整理一下，迎接她的到来。"

"What about all this stuff?"  
"那这些资料怎么办？"

"I'll deal with it, Ayanami arrives at fifteen hundred hours, now go."  
"我会处理的，绫波十五点到达，现在去吧。"

Shinji nodded and yawned loudly, he rested his head on the desk again and watched Misato leaving the room. Just at that moment his phone began to ring, he yawned and picked it up.  
真嗣点点头，大声打了个哈欠，再次将头靠在桌子上，看着美里离开房间。就在这时，他的手机开始响了，他打了个哈欠，拿起了手机。

"Ikari here." "碇，是我。"

"_Agent Shinji Ikari?"_ "碇真嗣特工？"

"Yes that's me." "是的，我就是。"

"_Good I'm glad I was able to contact you, I have information that might be of use to you."_  
"太好了，我很高兴能联系上你，我有信息可能对你有用。"

"Who is this?" “这是谁？”

"_A concerned citizen, I cannot say much, they might be watching this line."_  
“一个热心的市民，我不能多说，他们可能在监听这条线路。”

"Who might be watching this line?"  
“谁可能在监听这条线路？”

"_I can't explain, just meet me at the derelict arena on the edge of the city at half twelve. It is in your best interest, I look forward to meeting you."_  
"我无法解释，午夜十二点半在城市边缘的废弃竞技场见。对你最有利，期待与你见面。"

"Hold on a mi… damnit he hung up."  
"等一下…该死，他挂了。"

He put the phone down and picked it up again and attempted to recall the number, however the phone didn't even get through to dialing, instead he was cut off straight away with a strange message.  
他放下手机，又重新拿起，试图回拨那个号码，但电话甚至还没开始拨号，就直接被切断，传来一条奇怪的信息。

"_The number you have just called is a government line, for security reasons your call cannot be connected."_  
“您拨打的号码是政府专线，出于安全考虑，您的电话无法接通。”

He stared at the phone and put it down slowly, making a note of the time and place. He pocketed the note and stood up, preparing to go home. He wondered who the mystery person could have been, he was already aware of the person who had called Asuka back during the Sachiel case and wondered if it was the same person.  
他盯着电话，缓缓放下，记下了时间和地点。他将纸条放入口袋，站起身准备回家。他好奇那个神秘人会是谁，他已经知道在萨基尔事件期间给明日香回电话的人，不知道是否是同一人。

'_I'm sure I have time to stop by there before I go home'_  
“我肯定回家前有时间顺路去那里一趟。”

His thoughts quickly turned to Asuka who was elsewhere, it was strange but when she arrived he thought she had been sent to get his section shut down, but since she arrived they had actually received recognition from the director and even received praise from the higher ups in NERV. It was something he was not used to, and for the first time he felt happy about his job. Still, there was this nagging feeling inside him that something bad was about to happen.  
他的思绪很快转向了在别处的明日香，虽然奇怪，但当她到来时，他原以为她是被派来关闭他的部门的，但自从她来了以后，他们竟然得到了导演的认可，甚至从 NERV 的高层那里得到了赞扬。这是他不习惯的事情，也是他第一次对自己的工作感到高兴。然而，他内心总有一种不祥的预感，觉得坏事即将发生。

**Abandoned Car Park – 1230 hours  
废弃停车场 – 12 时 30 分**

Shinji got out of his car and looked across the parking lot, it was desolate save for a few abandoned cars. He walked around and leaned against his car, waiting for the person who called him. Almost as if on cue his cell phone started to ring, he answered it and it was the same person as before.  
真嗣下了车，环视着停车场，除了几辆废弃的车外，这里一片荒凉。他四处走动，靠在自己的车上，等待着那个打电话给他的人。仿佛是按了定时器一样，他的手机开始响了，他接起电话，还是之前那个人。

"_I see you made it, make your way to the section under the overpass and hurry it up."_  
“看来你到了，快到立交桥下的区域去，抓紧时间。”

Before he got a chance to reply, the line went dead once again, he nervously glanced around and then pocketed his phone. A realization hit him at that moment, maybe it wasn't such a good idea being here. He had poked his nose around quite a lot in the past few weeks, maybe someone had caught wind of this and this was going to be some sort of set up.  
还没等他有机会回复，电话又一次断了，他紧张地环顾四周，然后将手机放进口袋。那一刻，他突然意识到，也许来这里并不是个好主意。过去几周他打探得太多了，也许有人察觉到了，这可能是个陷阱。

'_No, that's not it, what a stupid idea. It Asuka was here she'd have called me an idiot for even considering that.'_  
“不，不是这样的，多蠢的想法。要是明日香在这里，她肯定会骂我居然会考虑这种事。”

He made his way over to the darkened area and was immediately pulled in by someone else. He felt the person stick a gun to his head and speak quietly at him.  
他走向那片昏暗的区域，立刻被另一个人拉了进去。他感觉到那人将枪抵在他的头上，低声对他说话。

"Stay silent and give me your NERV ID"  
保持安静，把你的 NERV ID 给我。

Shinji reached into his pocket and pulled out his ID being careful not to agitate the person. The person took it and glanced over it before giving it back to Shinji.  
真嗣小心翼翼地伸手进兜里，掏出自己的 ID，生怕激怒对方。那人接过 ID 匆匆扫了一眼，便还给了真嗣。

"Were you followed? "有人跟踪你吗？"

"No."

"Good." “好。”

He released his grip on Shinji and pocketed his gun, Shinji moved around to take a look at who the man was. It was a grey haired man wearing a stern expression, wearing a uniform Shinji recognized slightly but couldn't place where it was from.  
他松开了对真嗣的钳制，将枪收进口袋，真嗣绕到一旁想看看这人是谁。那是一个灰白头发的男人，表情严肃，穿着一套真嗣有些眼熟却想不起在哪见过的制服。

"Who are you?" “你是谁？”

"A friend, I've been observing your progress for the past few weeks. I have to say the way in which you and Agent Sohryu handled the Angels was impressive."  
"一个朋友，我观察你过去几周的进展。不得不说，你和草薙特工对付使徒的方式令人印象深刻。"

"You've been observing us?"  
"你一直在观察我们？"

"Yes, it's part of my job."  
"是的，这是我的工作的一部分。"

"So you're with NERV."  
"这么说你是 NERV 的人。"

"You could say that, I'm not meant to be meeting with you but I have information which may be of use to you and Agent Ayanami when she arrives. It's regarding the next Angel."  
"你可以这么说，我本不该与你见面，但我有一些信息可能对你和即将到来的绫波零特工有用。是关于下一个使徒的。"

"Angel?" "使徒？"

"Yes, the men you tracked down Sachiel and Shamshel were known as Angels. I cannot say more than that, however what you should know is the next one is about to enter Tokyo-3."  
"是的，你们追踪过的萨基尔和沙姆谢尔被称为使徒。我不能透露更多，但你需要知道的是，下一个使徒即将进入第三新东京市。"

"Why are you telling me this?"  
"你为什么要告诉我这些？"

"Because you need to be prepared. You, Ayanami and Sohryu are the only people who can take down the Angels."  
"因为你需要做好准备。你、绫波和惣流是唯一能击败使徒的人。"

"Why us, surely anyone who can handle a gun or any other weapon can take them down. Why does it need to be us?"  
"为什么是我们？肯定有其他人能用枪或其他武器对付他们。为什么非得是我们？"

"That is just the way it is, you have been chosen by NERV to do this."  
"事情就是这样，NERV 选择了你来执行这项任务。"

"Why have NERV chosen me, two months ago NERV didn't want anything to do with me, I was even considering leaving. Now it seems anything important is going straight to me."  
"为什么是 NERV 选择了我？两个月前他们还对我避之不及，我甚至考虑过离开。现在却似乎所有重要的事情都直接找上我。"

"My time here is up Shinji, I cannot explain anymore. Here is the name and data on the next Angel good luck"  
"我的时间到了，真嗣，我无法再解释更多。这是下一个使徒的名字和数据，祝你好运。"

"Where did you get his?"  
"这是从哪儿来的？"

"I have to go, goodbye Shinji."  
"我得走了，再见，真嗣。"

Shinji took the folder from the man and noticed a name on the front of the folder.  
真嗣从那人手中接过文件夹，注意到文件夹正面写着一个名字。

'_Ramiel'_ '拉米埃尔'

"Wait, just who are you?"  
"等等，你到底是谁？"

"My name is Kozo Fuyutsuki, do not try to check the records you won't find anything, just like you couldn't when you looked for Rei Ayanami."  
"我叫芙蓉京子，别费心去查记录了，你什么也找不到的，就像你当初查不到绫波零一样。"

Fuyutsuki began to walk away from Shinji and towards the car he had parked nearby, just as he got to the car he turned to Shinji and asked him one final question.  
冬月开始从真嗣身边走开，朝他停在附近的车走去，就在他走到车旁时，他转身向真嗣提出了最后一个问题。

"Shinji, why do you continue to work for NERV if you hate it so much?"  
“真嗣，既然你这么讨厌 NERV，为什么还要继续为他们工作？”

Shinji thought about his reply before speaking.  
真嗣思考了一下他的回答，然后开口说道。

"I'm here to uncover the truth."  
"我来这里是为了揭露真相。"

"Shinji there is no truth, just a collection of lies told by different men."  
"真司，世上没有真相，只有不同人编织的谎言。"

He got into the car and drove away, leaving Shinji standing there holding the folder he had just been given. Shinji opened the folder and began to look through the papers as he made his way back to the car. They were laid out in a similar manner to the ones during the Shamshel case, there was hardly any information just a name and a supposed picture of the person. There was one extra page attached to it, in the top right was a logo Shinji immediately recognized as the same seven eyed logo he had seen countless times before, underneath were hastily scribbled notes regarding the person.  
他上了车，驾车离去，留下真司站在那里，手里拿着刚被递给他的文件夹。真司打开文件夹，边走回车边翻阅文件。这些文件的排列方式与沙姆谢尔案件中的类似，几乎没有信息，只有一个名字和一张所谓的人的照片。其中还附有一张额外的页面，右上角是一个标志，真司立刻认出这是他之前无数次见过的七眼标志，下面是匆忙写下的关于此人的笔记。

'_Warning: Subject possesses strong A.T. Field and highly accurate aiming within a certain range. Do not approach the subject under any circumstances, if seen fall back and contact SEELE Personnel'_  
'警告：目标拥有强大的 A.T.力场及在一定范围内极高的瞄准精度。在任何情况下都不要接近目标，如发现目标请立即撤退并联系 SEELE 人员。'

Shinji slipped the paper back into the folder and opened the car door, trying to work out what the small passage could be. A.T. Fields and accurate aiming, it was like something out of a science fiction show. He wondered just what to do with the folder and the information.  
真嗣将纸条塞回文件夹，打开车门，试图弄清楚这段简短的文字可能意味着什么。A.T.力场和精准瞄准，这听起来像是科幻剧中的情节。他不知道该如何处理这份文件和其中的信息。

'_I'll hold onto it for now, and if we get any instructions from NERV regarding this person I'll tell Misato and Agent Sohryu when she returns.'_  
'我暂时先保管它，如果 NERV 针对此人下达任何指示，我会告诉美里和索留香特工她回来时的情况。'

**NERV Offices – 1530 hours  
NERV 办公室 – 15:30**

Shinji sighed as he and Misato waited for the arrival of Agent Ayanami, he looked at his watch and watched as the clock turned to 15:30 on the dot, just at that moment the door opened and Rei Ayanami made her way into the room. Shinji wasn't sure what to do, he looked at her nervously, looking up and down. This was, after all, his first proper look at the blue haired agent. The first thing that struck him was how much of a contrast she was to Asuka, whereas Asuka had vibrant blue eyes and fiery red hair, Rei was the complete opposite. His thoughts were interrupted by Misato greeting her.  
真嗣叹了口气，他和美里等待着绫波零特工的到来。他看了看手表，时钟正好指向 15:30。就在那一刻，门开了，绫波零走了进来。真嗣不确定该做什么，他紧张地上下打量着她。毕竟，这是他第一次正式见到这位蓝发特工。首先让他印象深刻的是她与明日香的鲜明对比，明日香有着明亮的蓝眼睛和火红的头发，而绫波则是完全相反。美里向她打招呼，打断了他的思绪。

"Agent Ayanami I'm Agent Misato Katsuragi, I'm the director of operations here"  
“绫波特工，我是美里·葛城，这里的行动主任。”

"Hello Agent Katsurai." "你好，片栗特工。"

Shinji picked up on another big difference between Ayanami and Sohryu here, Asuka spoke not so much loudly but put a fair amount of emotion in her voice. Rei again provided a stark contrast, not so much emotionless but more a voice of sorrow of sadness. Shinji couldn't quite place it but there was something about this woman that struck him as familiar. He cast aside his feelings and decided to greet her.  
在这里，真嗣察觉到了绫波和惣流之间的另一个显著差异，明日香说话声音并不特别大，但语气中充满了情感。丽则再次形成了鲜明对比，她的声音并非毫无感情，而是带着一种悲伤的哀愁。真嗣无法确切指出是什么，但这个女人身上有某种让他感到熟悉的东西。他暂时抛开这些感觉，决定向她打招呼。

"Welcome, I'm Agent Shinji Ikari."  
"欢迎，我是碇真嗣特工。"

She turned to look at him and something flashed in her eyes, Shinji noticed it but couldn't figure it out was it fear or recognition. She obviously recognized him having been present during the Sachiel and Shamshel case but there was something else when she saw him up close for the first time.  
她转头看向他，眼中闪过一丝异样，真嗣注意到了，却无法分辨那是恐惧还是认出他的神情。她显然认出了他，毕竟在萨基尔和沙姆谢尔事件中她也在场，但当她第一次近距离看到他时，似乎还有别的什么情绪。

"Ikari" “碇”

An uneasy silent fell across the room, Misato noticed this and decided to try some type of conversation.  
房间里陷入一阵不安的沉默，美里察觉到了这一点，决定尝试开启某种对话。

"So have you been in NERV very long, Agent Ayanami?"  
"你来 NERV 很久了吗，绫波零特工？"

"Yes." "是的。"

The reply was short and too the point, at that point Misato quickly excused herself, making the excuse she had some paperwork to file, leaving a very uncomfortable Shinji to speak to this young woman.  
她的回答简短而直接，那一刻，美里迅速找了个借口离开，说自己有些文件要处理，留下非常不自在的真嗣与这位年轻女子交谈。

"Agent Ayanami, can I ask you something?"  
"绫波零特工，我能问你一个问题吗？"

"Go ahead." "说吧。"

"How come you were present during two of the cases me and Agent Sohryu were working on?"  
"为什么我和草薙特工会处理的两个案件中都有你在场？"

"I was under instructions from the director to observe you and Agent Sohryu."  
"我是奉局长之命，观察你和草薙特工的。"

"Were you under instructions to attack us as well?"  
"你也是奉命来攻击我们的吗？"

"I cannot say any more Agent Ikari, have you been looking into my files?"  
"我不能再多说了，碇警官，你在调查我的档案吗？"

"What do you mean?"  
"你这是什么意思？"

Rei pointed to the paper Shinji had left on his desk regarding Rei and also to the ID Card that was on his desk.  
绫波指了指真嗣桌上关于她的那份文件，还有他桌上的身份证。

"Oh that, well sorry it's just you appeared and we didn't know who you were so we did a little digging. Sorry."  
"哦，那个啊，抱歉，只是你突然出现，我们不知道你是谁，所以稍微调查了一下。对不起。"

"I see." “我明白了。”

She walked over to the card and pocketed it, leaving Shinji feeling even more uncomfortable with each moment.  
她走过去把卡片收进口袋，每过一刻，真嗣都感到更加不自在。

'_Damnit I wish Agent Sohryu was here, she'd at least have some idea what to say. Although a lot of it would be offensive I guess.'_  
'该死，真希望草薙少尉在这里，她至少知道该说些什么。虽然可能很多话会冒犯到人吧。'

"So anyway, what do… oh the case."  
"总之，要做什么来着……哦，对了，案子。"

Rei turned to him and spoke quietly.  
丽转向他，轻声说道。

"We are to track down a man known as Ramiel, tomorrow he will enter Tokyo 3. The police will set up road blocks on locations he is expected to go to. You will take him out while I act as support."  
"我们明天要追踪一个名叫拉米尔的人，他将会进入第三新东京市。警方会在他预计前往的地点设置路障。你负责将他击倒，而我则提供支援。"

"Support?" "支援？"

"Yes, we will take up positions on opposite sides of the street. You will attack him while I act as a diversion and attract his attention."  
"是的，我们会在街道两侧占据位置。你负责攻击他，而我则作为诱饵吸引他的注意力。"

"Why… How come I haven't been told about this yet?"  
"为什么……我怎么还没被告知这件事？"

"I am unsure, are you uncomfortable with this task?"  
"我不确定，你对这项任务感到不适吗？"

"No why wo..." "不，为什么……"

"Good, the operation will commence tomorrow at Twelve-Hundred hours. Evangelion Units Zero and One will meet at NERV an hour prior to the operation."  
"很好，行动将于明天十二点整开始。零号机和初号机将在行动前一小时于 NERV 总部会合。"

Shinji's eyes flickered when he heard that word again, it was the second time he had hear Rei refer to him and her as Evangelion and it still didn't make any sense. Deciding not to go deeper into it he sat down at his desk, plunging the room into an uncomfortable silence once again. A strange thought crept into his mind, he wasn't sure why he was asking this but he just felt a desire to.  
当再次听到那个词时，真嗣的眼睛闪烁了一下，这是他第二次听到绫波用“EVA”来称呼他和她自己，这依然毫无意义。决定不再深究，他坐到桌前，再次让房间陷入了一种不自在的沉默。一个奇怪的念头悄悄爬上心头，他不明白自己为何会问这个问题，但就是有一种渴望驱使着他。

"Agent Ayanami, do you know a man by the name of Gendo Rokubungi?"  
“绫波特工，你认识一个叫源堂六分仪的人吗？”

Shinji definitely noticed something in Rei's face then, wheras it looked void of emotion before it was now almost happy at hearing that name. Maybe he was imagining it but it was almost as if there was some sort of recognition there. She turned to him and spoke softly.  
真嗣确实在那刻注意到了绫波脸上的变化，之前还毫无表情的脸现在几乎因听到那个名字而显得高兴。或许是他想象出来的，但那表情中似乎有一种认出的意味。她转向他，轻声说道。

"Yes, he looked after me many years ago and is responsible for my being in NERV. Why do you ask?"  
"是的，多年前他照顾过我，也是我进入 NERV 的原因。你为什么问这个？"

"No reason, I just met him last week at the hospital I was in but couldn't find anything else out about him. I was just wondering if anyone else knew him."  
"没什么特别的原因，我上周在医院碰见了他，但没能了解到更多关于他的信息。我只是想知道是否还有其他人认识他。"

"I see." “我明白了。”

**Shinji's Apartment – 1815 hours  
真嗣的公寓 – 1815 小时**

Shinji got out of his car and made his way up to his apartment, relieved that he could finally be at home. He held the folder he had been given by Fuyutsuki tightly, wondering if what was inside would actually be of any help. The documents in the folder gave no mention of Agent Ayanami however, yet she seemed to know more than him, or even Misato, on the case.  
真嗣从车里出来，向自己的公寓走去，庆幸终于能回家了。他紧紧握着被冬月给的文件夹，不知道里面的内容是否真的有用。文件夹里的文件并未提及绫波零特工，但她似乎比他和美里更了解这个案子。

'_Is she working for the same people Fuyutsuki is working for? Are those the same people with the seven eyed logo and what does Gendo Rokubungi have to do with it all? It doesn't make any sense'_  
'她是在为冬月工作的那群人效力吗？那些人是不是有着七眼标志的同一伙人？而碇源堂又与此有何关联？这一切都说不通'

His thoughts quickly turned to Asuka, he wondered what her case was and the reasons for that. He sighed and put his key into the apartment door and opened the door, just wanting to sit down and relax. As soon as he entered he was struck by a strange sense of foreboding. Something wasn't right in there and he knew it, he quietly entered through the hallway and made his way into the kitchen, the entire place had been ransacked. Cupboards had been opened, papers from the drawers were scattered everywhere. He dashed into his main room and found the TV on with the DVD Player open, DVD Cases were thrown about the room, with even more papers.  
他的思绪很快转向了明日香，他好奇她的案情和原因。他叹了口气，将钥匙插入公寓门锁并打开门，只想坐下来放松一下。一进门，他就感到一种不祥的预感。那里有些不对劲，他知道这一点，他悄悄地穿过走廊，走进厨房，整个地方都被洗劫一空。橱柜被打开，抽屉里的文件散落一地。他冲进主房间，发现电视开着，DVD 播放器敞开，DVD 盒散落一地，还有更多的文件。

'_Were… were they looking for something?'_  
“他们……是在找什么东西吗？”

He nervously pulled out his gun which was still holstered in his suit jacket and slowly made his way into his own bedroom. It was the same story there, the entire room had been ransacked but nothing had been taken. Shinji made his way back into the main room and began looking through the scattered papers, it was all the stuff on the Shamshel case including all the copies he had made of the profiles on Ayanami and the images of the seven eyed logo. He felt sick as he came across two profile sheets that had been added to the pile, the first was of Misato Katsuragi the second was of Asuka Langley Sohryu.  
他紧张地从西装外套里掏出还插在枪套里的手枪，缓缓走向自己的卧室。那里同样一片狼藉，整个房间被翻了个底朝天，但什么也没被拿走。真嗣回到客厅，开始翻阅散落一地的文件，全是关于沙姆沙尔案件的资料，包括他复制的关于绫波和七眼标志的所有档案。当他发现两张新增的档案纸时，感到一阵恶心，第一张是葛城美里，第二张是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。

'_Shit, they know we've been looking into them and they know who we are and have been looking for us. Could it be that folder Fuyutsuki gave me they were looking for?'_  
“该死，他们知道我们在调查他们，也知道我们的身份并一直在找我们。难道他们是在找那个由冬月交给我的文件夹？”

Pulling out his cell and quickly dialing in Misato's number he made his way into his bedroom again and sat down on the edge of the bed, waiting for her to pick up.  
他掏出手机，迅速拨通了美里小姐的号码，再次走进卧室，坐在床边，等待她接听。

'_Come on Misato answer the phone'_  
'快接电话啊，美里'

"Hello Katsuragi speaking."  
“您好，我是葛城。”

"Misato it's me Shinji, is everything alright over there?"  
"美里，是我，真嗣，那边一切都好吗？"

"Yes I think so why?"  
"是的，我想是的，怎么了？"

"They were here Misato, they were looking for something, I don't know what, but they thought it was here."  
"他们来过这里，美里，他们在找什么东西，我不知道是什么，但他们认为东西在这里。"

"Who was there?" "谁在那里？"

"I'll explain later, can I stay at yours for now?"  
"我稍后解释，现在能先住你那儿吗？"

"I guess so, I have a guest bedroom, what is all this about?"  
"我想可以，我有一间客房，这到底是怎么回事？"

"I'll explain later, phone me if anything happens."  
"我稍后解释，有事打电话给我。"

Just as he hung up he heard a car door slamming outside, Shinji peered out the window and noticed three men in suits making there way into the building.  
他刚挂断电话，就听到外面车门砰的一声关上，真嗣透过窗户望去，注意到三个穿西装的男人正朝大楼走去。

'_Damnit they've came back'_  
'该死，他们又回来了'

He quickly made his way out into the front room and picked up the folder Fuyutsuki had given him and the profiles on Asuka and Misato and put them into the folder. Dashing out of the front door, he heard the voices of the men coming up the stairs, deciding it would not be in his best interests to be spotted by them he headed towards the fire escape at the other end of the corridor. Fear began to rise in him as he made his way out of the window, being careful not to drop the folder in his hand.  
他迅速走向前厅，拿起冬月交给他的文件夹，将关于明日香和美里的人物资料放入其中。冲出前门时，他听到楼梯上传来男人们的声音，决定最好不要被他们发现，于是朝走廊另一端的消防通道跑去。当他小心翼翼地从窗户爬出时，手中的文件夹让他心生恐惧，生怕一不小心就将其掉落。

Cautiously he made his way down the fire escape, being careful not to make too much noise so as not to alert the people waiting outside his apartment complex. He finally made it to the ground when to his shock he found Rei Ayanami waiting for him.  
他小心翼翼地沿着消防通道往下走，尽量不发出太大声响，以免引起公寓楼外等候的人的注意。当他终于到达地面时，震惊地发现绫波零正在那里等着他。

"Agent Ikari, you must come with me."  
“碇指挥官，请跟我来。”

"Ayanami? What are you doing here?"  
"绫波？你在这里做什么？"

"I have been sent to take you to Katsuragi's place."  
"我被派来带你去葛城那儿。"

Just at that moment two of the men rounded the corner and without speaking, drew out two pistols and fired three shots in both Shinji and Rei's direction. Shinji quickly ducked behind a dumpster but Ayanami instead ran towards the two men. Shinji peered round the corner and watched as she quickly produced a blade and caught one of the men in the stomach. The other man quickly tried to catch Rei but she was too fast for him and was able to dodge his attack.  
就在这时，两名男子转过拐角，二话不说，拔出两把手枪，向真嗣和绫波的方向连开三枪。真嗣迅速躲到垃圾桶后，但绫波却径直冲向那两名男子。真嗣探头望去，只见她迅速抽出一把刀，刺中其中一人的腹部。另一名男子试图抓住绫波，但她动作太快，轻松躲过了他的攻击。

Fear gripped Shinji as he watched Rei fighting with the two men and he found himself unable to move. The previously wounded man got up and landed a blow directly in Rei's stomach. She fell to her knees and coughed up blood as they edged nearer to her, one of them took his pistol and hit her directly across the face with it. Shinji watched intently, trying to will himself to help.  
恐惧紧紧攫住了真嗣，他看着绫波与那两个男人搏斗，自己却动弹不得。先前受伤的男人站了起来，一拳直击绫波的腹部。她跪倒在地，咳出血来，他们逐渐逼近，其中一人掏出手枪，直接用枪身猛击她的脸颊。真嗣全神贯注地看着，努力说服自己上前帮忙。

'_I mustn't run away'_ '我不能逃避'

Rei tried to climb to her feet and produced her blade again, she drove it deep into one of the men and pushed the other away. Just at that moment Shinji made his way out from behind the dumpster and fired off a shot from his pistol at the remaining man, catching him in the shoulder. Overhead he could hear the footsteps of the other two men who had gone up to his apartment.  
绫波试图站起身，再次拔出她的刀，深深刺入其中一人，并将另一人推开。就在这时，真嗣从垃圾桶后现身，朝剩下的那个男人开枪，子弹击中了他的肩膀。头顶上，他听到了另外两个上楼去他公寓的男人的脚步声。

Shinji looked up and saw them running down the fire escape towards them, one of them fired two shots in his direction. He had no time to move out the way and stood there frozen, waiting for death when suddenly what seemed to be a barrier of light deflected the bullets onto the ground. Standing there, stunned for a moment, he put his hands out in front of him trying to feel for any sort of barrier, he was snapped out of it by Rei pulling him out of the alleyway.  
真嗣抬头望去，只见他们正沿着消防梯向这边跑来，其中一人朝他开了两枪。他来不及闪避，僵立原地，等待死亡降临，突然间，一道看似光之屏障的东西将子弹弹开，落在地上。他站在那里，一时惊呆了，伸出双手试图感知任何屏障的存在，却被绫波拉出了小巷。

_13th May 2015 2015 年 5 月 13 日_

**Barricaded Street – 1200 hours  
封锁街道 – 中午 12 点**

Misato looked across at the two agents waiting for the signal to move into position. To say she was scared would be an understatement, she was terrified, not only because of the man they had encountered out there on the streets but because of what had happened to Shinji and Rei last night. She was worried that those men could attack again as soon at any moment and this time they wouldn't let Shinji get away. The thought of losing Shinji scared her deeply. She sighed heavily and moved into the next room, leaving the two agents to talk.  
美里扫视着对面等待信号进入位置的两名特工。说她害怕都算是轻描淡写，她简直是恐惧至极，不仅因为他们在街上遭遇的那个男人，更因为昨晚真嗣和绫波发生的事情。她担心那些人随时可能再次发动攻击，而这次真嗣不会再有机会逃脱。失去真嗣的念头让她深感恐惧。她重重地叹了口气，走进了下一个房间，留下两名特工继续交谈。

Shinji just stared down at the ground, he was in a strange place at the moment, he wasn't to sure if he was doing the right thing. Last night he had been unable to react when someone he was working with was being attacked and in the past two attacks by these angels he had been incapacitated easily.  
真嗣只是低头盯着地面，此刻他身处一个奇怪的境地，不太确定自己是否在做正确的事。昨晚，当与他共事的人遭到攻击时，他无法做出反应，而在过去两次天使的袭击中，他轻易就被制服了。

'_Why am I still here, to uncover the truth? What truth am I trying to uncover, maybe I should just pack it all in. What use am I to them if I can't even react?'_  
'我为何还留在这里，是为了揭露真相吗？我试图揭露什么真相，也许我应该就此放弃。如果我连反应都做不到，对他们还有什么用呢？'

He looked over at Rei, her expression was calm yet stern, she merely stared off into the distance. Suddenly Shinji realized that he wished it was Asuka he was sitting beside and not this strange blue haired woman, Asuka always had something to say and was able to make him feel better, even if it was just her calling him an idiot.  
他瞥向丽，她的表情平静而严肃，只是凝视着远方。突然间，真嗣意识到他希望坐在身边的是明日香而不是这位蓝发女子，明日香总有话可说，总能让他感觉好些，哪怕只是她骂他一声笨蛋。

"Ayanami, why are you with NERV? I mean knowing how dangerous it is, why do you continue to work for them?"  
“绫波，你为什么留在 NERV？我是说，明知有多危险，你为何还继续为他们工作？”

She looked at him, her eyes seemingly sorrowful and simply spoke four words.  
她看着他，眼中似乎带着哀伤，只简单说了四个字。

"I have nothing else."  
“我别无他物。”

The words hit him hard and he wasn't sure why, maybe it was the reason he was there as well. Sure he always told himself he wanted to know the truth, the truth behind his mother's abduction and the truths the government were hiding from the public, but NERV was all he had known. Even when he was a teenager NERV was there, simply because Misato worked for them and then he got invited into the academy, if he left he had nothing else.  
那些话重重地击中了他，他不确定为何如此，也许这也是他来到这里的原因之一。当然，他总是告诉自己想要知道真相，关于他母亲被绑架的真相以及政府对公众隐瞒的真相，但 NERV 是他所知的全部。即便在他还是个少年时，NERV 就在那里，仅仅因为美里在那里工作，然后他被邀请进入学院，如果离开，他将一无所有。

"I see." “我明白了。”

Misato then made her way into the room with a stern expression on her face, she handed Shinji and Rei two sniper rifles and began speaking.  
美里随后带着严肃的表情走进房间，她递给真嗣和丽两把狙击步枪，并开始说话。

"Okay you two, this guy had killed several officers already, so be careful up there. He seems to have some sort of barrier but he needs to be aware of the bullet to project it. Agent Ayanami as per the instructions you will take up position next to Agent Ikari, you will be operating the dummy rifle while Shinji will be operating the main rifle. It has a silencer on it but we're not sure if it'll be of any use. It needs to be charged up but we have been told it should penetrate this person's barrier, but it's a long recharge process, so try to get him on the first shot."  
“好了，你们两个，这家伙已经杀死了几名军官，所以在上面要小心。他似乎有一种屏障，但需要意识到子弹才能展开。绫波零特工，根据指示，你将和碇真嗣特工一起行动，你将操作假步枪，而真嗣将操作主步枪。它装有消音器，但我们不确定是否有用。它需要充电，但我们被告知应该能穿透这个人的屏障，但充电过程很长，所以尽量在第一枪就击中他。”

"Yes Misato." "是的，美里小姐。"

"If he is aware of you he will shoot you, this guy has shot down our snipers in the choppers circling so try not to make him aware of you. Please, for the love of god, don't die out there."  
"如果他察觉到你，他会开枪的，这家伙已经击落了我们直升机上的狙击手，所以尽量不要让他注意到你。拜托，看在上帝的份上，别死在外面。"

The two of them nodded and made their way up the stairs to the next floor, the entire room was abandoned, save for the two rifles. Shinji nervously made his way over to the rifle and slipped his headset on. The rifle felt very heavy and was a new type of rifle, it was experimental technology given to NERV by the Japanese Government weapons research lab. Instead of using traditional ammo it fired a pulse of energy at the target, rendering it dead. Unfortunately it was a slow process between reloading as the rifle needed time to cool down from the previous shot.  
两人点点头，沿着楼梯上到下一层，整个房间空无一人，只剩下两支步枪。真嗣紧张地走向步枪，戴上耳机。这支步枪感觉非常沉重，是一种新型步枪，由日本政府武器研究实验室提供给 NERV 的实验技术。它不使用传统弹药，而是向目标发射能量脉冲，使其死亡。不幸的是，重新装填的过程很慢，因为步枪需要时间冷却上一次射击。

Shinji lifted the rifle and flipped the switch, a display appeared where you would load the bullets into on a normal rifle. It showed a bar charging up, similar to that of a laptop power status bar. He raised the rifle to the window and pointed it out across the desolate street. The entire block had been evacuated, even the people monitoring the police barricades had left. Above him he heard the sound of a helicopter taking off and just then Misato's voice came over his headset.  
真嗣举起步枪，拨动开关，原本装填子弹的地方出现了一个显示屏。上面显示着一条正在充电的进度条，类似于笔记本电脑的电源状态栏。他将步枪对准窗外，指向荒凉的街道。整个街区已被疏散，甚至连监控警察路障的人员也撤离了。头顶上方，他听到直升机起飞的声音，就在这时，美里通过耳机传来了声音。

"_Ok Shinji, we've cleared the building, it's up to you and Agent Ayanami now."_  
“好的，真嗣，我们已经清空了建筑物，现在就看你和绫波特工的了。”

"Okay, the rifle is charging."  
“好的，步枪正在充电。”

Shinji lowered his eye to the scope and looked through it, just as he did so he saw the figure of Ramiel enter the street. Holding a pistol in each hand, the man was huge, if it wasn't for the barrier deflecting everything he would have been captured ages ago even despite the mans aiming. Shinji tightened his grip on the rifle and lined up the scope with Ramiel's head.  
真嗣将眼睛贴近瞄准镜，就在这时，他看到了拉米尔的身影出现在街道上。那人双手各持一把手枪，身形巨大，若非有屏障挡下一切攻击，他早就被捕多年，尽管那人的瞄准技术了得。真嗣紧握步枪，将瞄准镜对准了拉米尔的头部。

"Rei, I'm ready." “绫波，我准备好了。”

Rei fired a shot directly at Ramiel catching his attention, the bullet merely bounced off of his field. Ramiel aimed one pistol at Reis direction and fired a shot, this was when Shinji took his chance' he fired a blast from the rifle aiming it directly at Ramiel's head' when Ramiel quickly spun round noticing the blast coming towards him and fired a shot of his own directly into the center of the pulse of energy' sending it off course and into the ground beside him.  
绫波向拉米尔直接开了一枪，吸引了他的注意，子弹只是从他的力场弹开。拉米尔用一把手枪瞄准绫波的方向开火，这时真嗣抓住了机会；他从步枪中发射出一道冲击波，直接瞄准拉米尔的头部。拉米尔迅速转身，注意到冲击波朝他袭来，便朝能量脉冲中心开了一枪，使其偏离轨道，击中了他身旁的地面上。

Shinji quickly pulled the rifle out of the window and ducked behind the wall' narrowly missing the bullet that flew past him. He quickly set the rifle to recharge' cursing under his breath.  
真嗣迅速从窗户抽出步枪，躲到墙后，险些被飞过的子弹击中。他迅速将步枪设置为充能状态，低声咒骂着。

"Shit Shit Shit, that wasn't meant to happen, how could someone be that precise?"  
“该死该死该死，这不该发生的，怎么会有人如此精准？”

He impatiently growled as he watched the rifles status bar recharge, knowing Ramiel was still outside waiting to take his shot. After what seemed like an eternity the rifle finished recharging. He looked over at Rei who was still ducked behind the wall, she looked at Shinji and spoke softly.  
他不耐烦地低吼着，盯着步枪的状态栏充能，知道雷米尔还在外面等着开枪。仿佛过了一个世纪，步枪终于充能完毕。他看向仍然躲在墙后的绫波，她看着真嗣，轻声说道。

"Goodbye… Shinji." "再见……真嗣。"

With those words she swung out of the cover and began firing at Ramiel.  
说完这些话，她冲出掩体，开始向雷米尔射击。

"Rei what are you doi…"  
"绫波，你在做什么……"

He watched in shock as a bullet hit Rei in the arm, but she kept on firing. Shinji quickly got up and tried to get Ramiel in his scope again, praying that this time he would be able to hit him. He lined up the target in his scope and fired off his second shot, closing his eyes waiting for it to be over. Next to him he heard Rei's body slump to the ground as he fell to his knees with his eyes clamped shut tightly.  
他震惊地看着一颗子弹击中了丽的胳膊，但她依旧继续射击。真嗣迅速起身，试图再次将雷米尔纳入瞄准镜中，祈祷这次能够击中。他将目标对准在瞄准镜中，发射了第二枪，闭上眼睛等待一切结束。在他身旁，他听到丽的身体瘫倒在地，他自己也跪倒在地，双眼紧闭。

After a minute of just kneeling there motionless, he peered out over the edge, the blast had taken down Ramiel and a sense of relief washed over him. Shinji collapsed to the ground and threw the rifle to the side. He looked across and was horrified to see Rei lying motionless on the ground.  
跪在那里一动不动地过了一分钟后，他探头望向边缘，爆炸已经击倒了雷米尔，一阵解脱感涌上心头。真嗣瘫倒在地，将步枪扔到一旁。他环顾四周，惊恐地发现丽一动不动地躺在地上。

"Ayanami" 绫波

He ran over to her and turned her over, thankfully she was still breathing. Shinji felt a tear rolling down his cheek as she looked up into his eyes.  
他跑向她，将她翻过身来，谢天谢地，她还在呼吸。真嗣感到一滴泪水顺着脸颊滑落，当她抬头望进他的眼睛时。

"Why… why are you crying?"  
“为什么……你为什么在哭？”

"I thought… because I'm glad you're alive."  
“我以为……因为我太高兴你还活着。”

"Should I be crying too?"  
"我也应该哭吗？"

"No, you should be smiling Ayanami, because you're alive."  
"不，你应该微笑绫波，因为你还活着。"

**NERV Helicopter NERV 直升机**

"What happened, are you both okay?"  
"发生了什么，你们俩都没事吧？"

"_We're fine, Ayanami was shot in the arm but the target has gone down."_  
"我们没事，绫波手臂中了一枪，但目标已经倒下了。"

"Good, we're inbound on your position now, pick up should be in five minutes."  
"很好，我们正朝你们的位置赶来，预计五分钟后接应。"

Misato switched the headset off and breathed a sigh of relief that it was over. If she was being honest she didn't even expect the operation to be a success, the fact that it was a success was nothing short of a miracle.  
美里关掉耳机，长舒了一口气，庆幸这一切终于结束了。说实话，她甚至没指望这次行动能成功，结果能如此顺利，简直是个奇迹。

'_Damn, I need a drink after this'_  
“该死，这之后我得喝一杯。”

Just at that moment her cellphone went off, she curiously picked it up and spoke into it.  
就在这时，她的手机响了，她好奇地拿起手机，对着话筒说道。

"Katsuragi speaking?" "是葛城吗？"

"_It's Agent Sohryu I'm here with Agent Kaji, look is Ikari there?"_  
"我是惣流特工，我和加持在一起，伊卡洛斯在吗？"

"We're inbound to his position now, why you missing him already?"  
"我们正前往他那儿，怎么，已经开始想他了？"

"_No, this is serious. Look do not tell him this yet Kaji has just given me some important information regarding Shinji that I think you should know."_  
"不，这是认真的。听着，别现在告诉他，加持刚刚给了我一些关于真嗣的重要信息，我觉得你应该知道。"

"Can't it wait, we're in the middle of an operation here?"  
"不能等会儿吗，我们正在执行任务呢？"

"_No it can't I don't have much time, Misato listen to me, whatever you do, do not tell Shinji this."_  
"不行，我没多少时间了，美里，听我说，无论如何，不要告诉真嗣这件事。"

"Okay, okay what is it?"  
“好了，好了，什么事？”

"_Misato, Gendo Rokubungi is Shinji's fath…"_  
“美里，源渡是真嗣的父…”

The call ended abruptly with a loud noise, Misato stood there, open mouthed, wondering what the Agent was about to say and wondering what the noise was. She realized that the call was still going and the noise sounded again.  
电话突然在一声巨响中中断，美里站在那里，张口结舌，不知道特工要说什么，也不知道那声响是什么。她意识到通话还在继续，那声响再次传来。

'_A gunshot?'_ “枪声？”

### Chapter 8 Over The Rainbow

_12th May 2015 2015 年 5 月 12 日_

**Yokohama Airport – 1000 hours  
横滨机场 – 上午 10 点**

Asuka stepped off the plane, taking a look around the terminal, immediately noticing just how similar it was to the one she had been stuck in at Tokyo 3 for most of the night. She hoisted her small travel bag over her shoulder and moved through the terminal to where she was supposed to meet Kaji.  
明日香走下飞机，环顾航站楼，立刻注意到它与她在第三新东京市度过大半夜的那个航站楼有多么相似。她将小旅行包甩到肩上，穿过航站楼，前往她应该与加持见面的地方。

'_I only hope he got my message that the plane was delayed, stupid flights, nothing ever goes right.'_  
“我只希望他收到了我的信息，知道飞机延误了，这些该死的航班，从来就没有顺利过。”

She flashed her NERV ID at one of the security guards at the customs area and was immediately put straight through, much to her surprise and the disgruntlement of the rest of the people waiting in the queue. Making sure there wasn't some sort of mistake she questioned the security guard who had just put her straight through.  
她在海关区域向一名保安出示了 NERV 的 ID，令她惊讶的是，她立刻被直接放行，这让其他排队等候的人颇为不满。她确保这不是什么误会，便向刚刚让她直接通过的保安询问。

"Is something going on here, NERV Agents aren't usually fast tracked like this?"  
“这里是不是有什么情况？NERV 特工通常不会这样快速通关的。”

"You are Miss Asuka Langley Sohryu aren't you?"  
"您就是惣流·明日香·兰格雷小姐，对吧？"

"Yeah..." "是啊..."

"Then come with us, we've been given orders to get you through here as soon as possible, it seems you're a very special VIP Miss Sohryu."  
"那么请跟我们来，我们接到的命令是尽快护送您通过这里，看来您是一位非常重要的贵宾，惣流小姐。"

Asuka grinned widely at hearing the security officer say those words, if there was ever a good way to inflate someone's ego, saying that is one of them.  
听到安保人员这么说，明日香得意地咧嘴笑了，如果说有什么能迅速膨胀一个人的自尊心，这句话绝对算得上其中之一。

"I see, well lead the way."  
"我明白了，那就带路吧。"

"Yes Ma'am." "是的，女士。"

He led her straight through the terminal, bypassing any customs or security checks along the way. Asuka couldn't help but smile when she caught a look at all the angry faces of the passengers who had to wait at all the security checkpoints. Taking a look around as they moved quickly through the corridors and rooms she couldn't help but notice an increased security presence in the terminal.  
他径直带着她穿过航站楼，一路上绕过了所有的海关和安检。看到那些不得不在安检口等待的乘客们愤怒的表情，明日香忍不住笑了。当他们快速穿过走廊和房间时，她不禁注意到航站楼内安保人员的数量有所增加。

"Excuse me, but what's with all the increased security today?"  
"不好意思，今天怎么加强了这么多安保？"

"I haven't been told, we were just told to escort you through the terminal."  
"我也不清楚，我们只是接到命令护送你通过航站楼。"

He continued leading the way until they got into the entrance area of the terminal, the security guard promptly left her and she looked around, hoping to catch a glimpse of Kaji. She looked around at the mass of people and then heard a voice to her left, she spun around and smiled again sure enough he was there and he hadn't changed a bit from when Asuka had last seen him. She shouted his name and ran over towards him, hugging him tightly.  
他继续带路，直到他们进入航站楼的入口区域，保安随即离开她，她环顾四周，希望能看到加持。她扫视着人群，然后听到左边传来一个声音，她转过身，再次微笑，果然他在那里，和上次明日香见到他时一样，一点都没变。她大声喊出他的名字，跑过去紧紧拥抱他。

"Kaji!" "加持！"

"Asuka, or should I say Agent Sohryu now?"  
"明日香，或者我现在该称呼你为碇唯了？"

"Asuka is fine" "叫我明日香就好"

Kaji took a look at her, he was surprised at how much she had changed over the past ten years. He actually had to wonder if this was the same girl he had looked after, the same girl who had the schoolgirl crush on him and thought every other male except for him was a pervert, the same Asuka who built a wall around, herself not letting anyone through.  
加持打量着她，惊讶于过去十年间她变化之大。他甚至开始怀疑，这是否还是那个他曾经照顾过的女孩，那个对他怀有校园情愫、认为除了他以外的所有男人都是变态的明日香，那个筑起高墙、不让任何人进入内心的明日香。

_Maybe people do change. 或许人真的会改变。_

"So how is NERV treating you?"  
“那么，NERV 对你怎么样？”

"It's good, although they've got me stuck in Tokyo 3 at the moment working on special cases dealing with 'the unexplained' and my partner is a bit weird."  
“挺好的，不过他们现在把我困在第三新东京市，处理一些关于‘无法解释’的特殊案件，而且我的搭档有点古怪。”

Kaji laughed. 加治笑了。

"And who are you working with?"  
"你在和谁合作？"

"Shinji Ikari." 碇真嗣。

Kaji stopped in his tracks, Ikari it was a name he hadn't heard for some time, not since he joined NERV and not since he dated…  
加治停下脚步，碇这个名字他已经很久没听到了，自从他加入 NERV 以来，自从他交往过……

'_Katsuragi'_ '葛城'

"Shinji Ikari, tell me is it the same Shinji Ikari who..."  
“碇真嗣，告诉我，是不是那个……”

"…Misato Katsuragi was the guardian of? Yes the very same, Misato is our director of operations."  
"…葛城美里是那位监护人吗？没错，正是同一位，美里是我们作战部门的主任。"

"I see, what a coincidence that we all meet again."  
"原来如此，我们再次相遇真是巧合。"

"I suppose so, but you're only here for this one case aren't you?"  
"我想是的，但你只是为了这个案件才来的，对吧？"

"Nope, after this case I'm being assigned to NERV Tokyo 3. I won't be working in the same area as you and Shinji but I'm being assigned there anyway."  
"不，这个案子结束后，我将被调到 NERV 东京 3 号分部。虽然不会和你以及真嗣在同一区域工作，但无论如何我都会被派到那里。"

"Great, so what are we here for?"  
"那太好了，我们来这儿是为了什么？"

"I'll explain when we get back to the NERV Branch here, but what do you say we go get something to eat first. Doesn't seem right launching a pretty young agent like you straight into work when she's just flown in."  
"等我们回到这里的 NERV 分部我再解释，不过我们先去吃点东西怎么样？让一位刚飞来的年轻漂亮特工直接投入工作，似乎不太合适。"

Asuka smiled and felt herself glowing red, she might have changed a bit in the past ten years but this was definitely the same Kaji she had a schoolgirl crush on all that time ago. She nodded and followed him out the airport towards the waiting car.  
明日香微笑着，感觉自己脸颊泛红，虽然过去十年间她或许有所改变，但眼前这人无疑是当年那个让她心动的加持先生。她点点头，跟着他走出机场，朝等候的汽车走去。

**NERV Yokohama – 1230 hours  
NERV 横滨分部 – 1230 时**

Yokohama's branch of NERV was more grand and majestic than the branch in Tokyo 3. Whereas Tokyo-3's branch was a huge tower situated in the center of the city, the Yokohama branch was a smaller, four leveled building situated just outside one of Yokohama's parks. It served as an amazing contrast to what Asuka was used to. She stepped out of the car and removed her sunglasses, another thing she had quickly came to like about Yokohama was it was a lot brighter than Tokyo 3.  
NERV 横滨分部的规模与气势远超第三新东京市的分部。第三新东京市的分部是一座位于城市中心的高塔，而横滨分部则是一座较小、四层楼高的建筑，坐落于横滨某公园的外围。这种对比让明日香感到新奇。她走出汽车，摘下太阳镜，横滨比第三新东京市明亮得多，这也是她很快喜欢上这里的原因之一。

'_I almost wish I had been assigned here in the first place'_  
'我几乎希望一开始就被分配到这里'

She followed Kaji through into the main building, even the interior was incredibly different. Everything looked so new, clean and welcoming, it was almost as if she was visiting one of those huge English mansions she had read about and not going to work. She couldn't help but make a comment about it to Kaji.  
她跟着加持穿过主楼，就连内部也截然不同。一切看起来都那么新、干净且温馨，仿佛她是在参观那些她读过的宏伟英国庄园，而不是去上班。她忍不住向加持发表了对此的看法。

"This place is so different to the Tokyo 3 branch."  
“这个地方和第三新东京分部太不一样了。”

He laughed and quickly replied.  
他笑了笑，迅速回答。

"It's different to most of the other NERV Branches throughout Japan, after the impact incident fifteen years ago NERV Tokyo had to move its HQ and the Japanese Government gave them lease of this place which was originally a palace, it wasn't until a year or two after the impact incident when NERV relocated its main HQ to Tokyo 3."  
“与日本各地的其他 NERV 支部不同，在十五年前的那场撞击事件后，NERV 东京不得不搬迁总部，日本政府将这个地方——原本是一座宫殿——租给了他们。直到撞击事件发生一两年后，NERV 才将主要总部迁至第三新东京市。”

"I see, they should have kept the main HQ here."  
“我明白了，他们本应保留这里的总部。”

"Too many important people live in Tokyo-3 Asuka, it had to be there, especially with that being Japan's capital now."  
“太多重要人物居住在第三新东京市了，明日香，那里必须成为总部，尤其是现在那里已成为日本的政治中心。”

The made their way into Kaji's office and he immediately sat down behind his desk, Asuka found a seat near to the desk and pulled it across, wondering if she was now going to find out her reason for being in Yokohama. Sure enough Kaji pulled out a folder from his desk and handed it to Asuka.  
他们走进了加持的办公室，他立刻坐到了自己的办公桌后，明日香在桌旁找了个座位，拉近椅子，心中猜测是否即将揭晓她来横滨的原因。果然，加持从桌子里抽出一个文件夹递给了明日香。

"Asuka, before you open that I need to know something, you don't get seasick do you?"  
“明日香，在你打开之前，我需要确认一件事，你不会晕船吧？”

"No, what does that have to do with this?"  
“不会，这跟这个有什么关系？”

She opened the folder and took a look at the front document, it was a similar document to the one her and Shinji had been given during the Shamshel case.  
她打开文件夹，瞥了一眼前面的文件，与她和真嗣在沙姆谢尔案件中收到的文件相似。

"_For Agents Sohryu and Kaji,_  
致特工绫波和加持，

_NERV has recently become aware of a terrorist threat about to move into Japan, we believe this person, who goes by the alias of Gaghiel, is plotting to cause a widespread disturbance in the cities of Yokohama, Tokyo 3 and Matsushiro. We have reason to believe he is hiding away on a UN Navy Ship, The USS Over The Rainbow, this ship is currently part of a fleet carrying various nuclear weapons towards Japan, should these weapons fall into Gaghiel's hands the entire country of Japan is at risk.  
NERV 最近获悉一起即将进入日本的恐怖威胁，我们相信此人，代号为加吉尔，正策划在横滨、第三新东京市和松代町制造大规模骚乱。我们有理由相信他藏匿在一艘联合国海军舰艇上，即彩虹号（USS Over The Rainbow），该舰目前隶属于一支载有多种核武器向日本驶来的舰队，一旦这些武器落入加吉尔手中，整个日本都将面临巨大风险。_

_He has not made any demands as of yet but the US Government are also tracking him and have reason to believe he was behind the bombing of a facility in Nevada just under a year ago. Target is incredibly dangerous and must be stopped by any means necessary, you will both rendezvous with a helicopter pilot at 1030 hours on the 13th May and he will fly you both on board the Over The Rainbow.  
截至目前，他尚未提出任何要求，但美国政府也在追踪他，并有理由相信他就是去年几乎同一时间内华达州某设施爆炸案的幕后黑手。目标极其危险，必须不惜一切手段阻止。你们两人将于 5 月 13 日 10 时 30 分与一名直升机飞行员会合，他将载你们登上‘彩虹之上’号。_

_The crew are not aware of your reasons for being there, you are there under the pretences of an emergency inspection by the Japanese Government. Enclosed are two passes which should give you free roam of the ship. You are to apprehend Gaghiel and bring him back by any means necessary.  
船员们并不知晓你们此行的真正目的，你们将以日本政府紧急检查的名义登船。随信附上两张通行证，应能让你们在船上自由行动。你们的任务是逮捕加吉尔，并务必将其带回。_

_Signed 签名_

_Director of NERV" NERV 局长_

Strangely enough the letter ended there, the name of the director had been blurred out, Asuka turned to Kaji and enquired about this.  
说来奇怪，信件到此戛然而止，署名处被模糊处理了。明日香转向加持，询问此事。

"Has this letter been tampered with since you received it?"  
“这封信自你收到后，有没有被人动过手脚？”

He looked at the blurred name and frowned slightly.  
他看着那模糊的名字，微微皱起了眉头。

"No that's how it arrived, probably an error in the printing."  
“不，它是那样送来的，可能是印刷错误。”

"I see, so who is this person we're after?"  
"我明白了，那我们追查的这个人是谁？"

"We don't have much to go on, not even a picture of the supposed suspect, all we know is the identity of him. NERV believes he is the head of a small terrorist organization responsible for the bombing of an American Government facility in Nevada last year and we also have reason to believe he was associated with the Tokyo 2 attacks."  
"我们掌握的线索不多，甚至连嫌疑人的照片都没有，只知道他的身份。NERV 认为他是一个小型恐怖组织的头目，该组织去年在美国内华达州炸毁了一处政府设施，而且我们有理由相信他与东京 2 号的袭击有关。"

"You mean the poisoned water supply? That was a terrorist attack?"  
"你是说水源被投毒的事？那是恐怖袭击吗？"

"Publicly no, but NERV believes it was the act of his group. However, to not cause widespread panic they have not released this information until they can be sure. It now seems this person has snuck into the fleet."  
"公开场合下没有承认，但 NERV 相信这是他所属组织的行动。为了避免引起大规模恐慌，他们没有公布这一信息，直到能够确定为止。现在看来，这个人已经潜入了舰队。"

Kaji looked up and suddenly noticed Asuka clutching her head, apparently in some sort of pain. He frowned and moved around to her, putting his arm around her.  
加持抬头时突然注意到明日香紧抱着头，显然是感到疼痛。他皱起眉头，绕到她身边，用手臂环抱住她。

"Asuka, are you feeling alright?"  
"明日香，你感觉还好吗？"

"I... I'm fine, What's the fleet carrying?"  
“我……我没事，舰队携带了什么？”

"Nuclear Weapons, that's why NERV needs him taken care of."  
"核武器，这就是 NERV 需要他处理的原因。"

"I see." "原来如此。"

"Asuka maybe it'd be best for you to go back to your motel and get some rest for tomorrow, you don't look very well at all, you've gone extremely pale."  
"明日香，也许你最好回汽车旅馆休息一下，为明天做准备，你看起来不太好，脸色非常苍白。"

"No I'm fine, don't worry about it."  
"不，我没事，不用担心。"

She stood up and immediately lurched forward, she put her hands out on Kaji's desk trying to stop herself from collapsing. Her vision became blurred, she felt Kaji's hand steering her back down towards the chair she was previously sitting on. Nausea overwhelmed her as she sat down.  
她站起身来，随即向前踉跄一步，双手撑在加持的桌面上，试图稳住自己不致倒下。视野变得模糊，她感到加持的手正引导她重新坐回先前的椅子。坐下时，恶心感如潮水般袭来。

"Asuka there's something wrong, look don't worry about it I'll drive you back to your hotel."  
"明日香，有点不对劲，别担心，我开车送你回酒店。"

"No really I'm fine, it's not to far from here anyway."  
"真的，我没事，这里离酒店也不远。"

She stood up and Kaji tried to steady her, she turned to face him and swatted his hands away.  
她站起身来，加持试图扶稳她，她转过身面对他，挥手甩开了他的手。

"I told you I'm fine, just... leave me alone, ok. I'll see you tomorrow"  
"我告诉过你我没事，只是...让我一个人待着，好吗。明天见"

She ran out of the room leaving Kaji standing there frowning and thinking to himself.  
她跑出房间，留下碇真嗣站在那里皱眉沉思。

'_Maybe some people don't change so easily'._  
'或许有些人并不那么容易改变'。

He took a look at the front sheet of the document once again before looking towards where Asuka had just left.  
他再次瞥了一眼文件的封面，随后转向了明日香刚刚离开的方向。

'_Ikari what are you going to put those two through?'_  
'碇，你打算让那两个人经历什么？'

**Motel Room – 1940 hours  
汽车旅馆房间 – 晚上七点四十分**

Asuka lay in the bath, desperately trying to will her headache to leave her, she had hoped taking a bath would help ease the headache and the feeling of nausea in her stomach but it was to no avail. Ever since she had left the NERV Offices the feeling had only gotten worse. She got out of the bath and quickly dried herself off before moving into the bedroom, not bothering to put any clothes on. She stood in front of the full length mirror in the room and looked herself over, her entire body had turned pale. Another pain shot across her stomach, bringing her to her knees.  
明日香躺在浴缸里，拼命试图用意志力驱走头痛，她本以为泡个澡能缓解头痛和胃里的恶心感，但毫无效果。自从离开 NERV 办公室后，这种感觉愈发严重。她从浴缸中起身，迅速擦干身体，走进卧室，懒得穿上任何衣物。她站在房间里的全身镜前，审视着自己，整个身体都变得苍白。又一阵疼痛划过腹部，使她跪倒在地。

'_Stupid fucking pain why won't it go, why me?'_  
'该死的疼痛，为什么就是不消，为什么要找上我？'

She screamed out and knocked the bedside table over in frustration, tears threatened to form but she quickly blinked them away before pain shot through her stomach again. She quickly dashed back into the bathroom overwhelmed by nausea, she held her stomach and lurched forward, emptying the contents of her stomach into the toilet. She fell back onto the cold tiles and breathed deeply as her stomach began to settle down. Unable to stand, she made her way back into the bedroom and looked at herself in the mirror.  
她尖叫着，愤怒地将床头柜推倒，泪水几乎要涌出，但她迅速眨眼忍住，紧接着又一阵疼痛贯穿腹部。她急忙冲回浴室，被恶心感淹没，双手抱腹向前倾，将胃里的东西吐进马桶。她跌坐在冰冷的地砖上，深呼吸试图平复胃部。无法站立，她爬回卧室，再次望向镜中的自己。

'_Disgusting…'_ '恶心……'

She felt herself at the brink of passing out and looked up at the mirror, she was a complete mess. Sweat was pouring down her face and her body had grown even paler over the last ten minutes. As she stared at herself she could have sworn she saw something moving inside her, right from the center of her breasts down to her stomach. She blinked and fell to the floor uttering only one word.  
她感到自己即将昏厥，抬头望向镜子，发现自己狼狈不堪。汗水顺着脸颊直流，过去十分钟里她的身体变得更加苍白。盯着镜中的自己，她几乎可以发誓看到有什么东西在体内移动，从胸口正中一直延伸到腹部。她眨了眨眼，随即瘫倒在地，只吐出一个字。

"Mama…" “妈妈……”

_13th May 2015 2015 年 5 月 13 日_

**Yokohama Docks – 1030 hours  
横滨码头 – 上午 10 点 30 分**

Kaji stepped out of the car and looked out across the docks, sure enough Asuka was there waiting for him. He was surprised at how different she looked from yesterday, especially after the incident in the office. She looked up and peered through her dark sunglasses at him and called him over.  
加持走下汽车，环视着码头，果然，明日香在那里等着他。他对她与昨天截然不同的样子感到惊讶，尤其是在办公室发生那件事之后。她抬起头，透过深色太阳镜盯着他，招呼他过去。

"Kaji! Over here." “加持！这边。”

"Hold on a minute."  
“等一下。”

He pulled his suit jacket on and then quickly made his way over towards Asuka, he studied her carefully. She still looked pale but he couldn't get a good look at her as she stood with her back to him. He frowned realizing what she was doing.  
他穿上西装外套，随即快步走向明日香，仔细打量着她。她的脸色依旧苍白，但由于她背对着他，他无法看清她的表情。他皱起眉头，意识到她在做什么。

"So are you ready for this?"  
“那么，你准备好迎接这个了吗？”

"Of course I am, why wouldn't I be?"  
“我当然在，怎么会不在呢？”

"No reason, I was just wondering because you didn't seem to be well yesterday."  
“没什么特别的原因，只是昨天看你状态不太好，有点担心。”

She glared at him through her sunglasses and replied angrily, her headache not helping matters.  
她透过太阳镜瞪着他，愤怒地回答，头痛更是火上浇油。

"There was nothing wrong with me yesterday and there's nothing wrong with me now, can we just drop the subject."  
“我昨天没事，现在也没事，我们能不能别再提这个了。”

Kaji knew she was lying but he also knew there was nothing he could do to get her to admit it, he decided it would be best to drop the subject. He decided to move onto the subject at hand as he heard the chopper approaching.  
加持知道她在撒谎，但也明白无法让她承认，他决定最好还是别再纠缠这个话题。他听到直升机接近的声音，决定转向当前的议题。

"You're aware of what needs to be done aren't you?"  
"你知道需要做什么，对吧？"

"Of course, we go onto the ship capture the person and come back. It'll be easy."  
"当然，我们上船抓人然后回来。这很简单。"

"Let's not be overconfident here, this is a dangerous individual."  
"我们不要太自信，这是个危险人物。"

"Whatever." “随便。”

She stared out towards the incoming chopper and felt a sharp pain through her stomach again. The chopped flew overhead and set itself down on the helipad nearby, before she got a chance to move towards it Kaji put his hand out and stopped her, smiling down at her.  
她凝视着迎面而来的直升机，胃部再次传来一阵剧痛。直升机从头顶掠过，稳稳降落在附近的停机坪上，她还没来得及迈步，碇便伸出手拦住了她，低头对她微笑。

"Look Asuka, sorry if I said something wrong, I'm just concerned for you, it's been ten years and I don't want something to happen to you."  
“听着，明日香，如果我说错了什么，我很抱歉，我只是关心你，已经十年了，我不想你出什么事。”

"I told you it's nothing, just well just personal stuff."  
“我说了没事，只是……只是些私事。”

"Oh I see, I'll just uhh, drop the subject then."  
“哦，我明白了，那我就...呃，不提这个话题了。”

"Thank you." “谢谢。”

He followed her into the chopper and took a seat opposite her, frowning as he watched her trying to hide herself from rubbing her head.  
他跟着她上了直升机，坐在她对面，皱着眉头看她试图掩饰自己因头痛而揉头的动作。

'_You're good at lying Asuka but you can't fool me, I know there's something wrong. The serum is taking full effect on you, but you don't know you've got it inside you, your pride won't let you admit you're not well.'_  
“你很擅长撒谎，但骗不了我，我知道你有问题。血清正在你体内发挥作用，但你并不知道自己体内有它，你的骄傲不允许你承认自己身体不适。”

**USS Over the Rainbow – 1115 hours  
彩虹号飞船 —— 1115 时**

Asuka looked out over the ocean, taking a look at the fleet they were approaching, the ship they were to be landing on was a huge aircraft carrier. On the front she could see various missiles covered in white sheets. Just as there were about to land she felt another sharp pain shoot through her head.  
明日香眺望着海面，审视着即将接近的舰队，他们即将降落的船只是一艘巨大的航空母舰。在前方，她可以看到各种被白布覆盖的导弹。就在他们即将着陆时，她感到头部又一阵剧痛袭来。

"Well here we are." “好了，我们到了。”

She looked across at Kaji who was smiling at her, she smiled back at him and got herself ready to exit the chopper. It came to a halt and landed softly on the ships desk, allowing both her and Kaji to exit quickly, as soon as they exited it pulled back up and headed away from the fleet.  
她望向正在对她微笑的克己，回以微笑并准备离开直升机。直升机稳稳地降落在舰船甲板上，她和克己迅速下机。他们一离开，直升机便重新升空，远离了舰队。

"Why isn't it waiting for us?"  
“为什么它不等我们？”

"Too risky, if Gaghiel gets his hands on it he can escape, we want to try to avoid that. Also try to avoid weapons fire on board the ships deck, we can't risk setting off one of these weapons."  
"太冒险了，如果加吉尔拿到它就能逃脱，我们得尽量避免这种情况。另外，尽量避免在甲板上使用武器，我们不能冒险引爆其中一件。"

"Yes, yes I understand."  
“是的，是的，我明白。”

As they walked off the helipad they were immediately stopped by a man in a UN Uniform.  
当他们离开停机坪时，一名身着联合国制服的男子立刻拦住了他们。

"Excuse me, no civilians on deck."  
“抱歉，甲板上不允许平民进入。”

Asuka pulled out her ID, Kaji quickly followed suit.  
明日香掏出她的身份证，加持也迅速照做。

"We're NERV agents, I believe your admiral was expecting us."  
"我们是 NERV 的特工，相信你们的舰队司令在等我们。"

He looked at her sternly and barked back.  
他严厉地看着她，厉声回应。

"I am the Admiral, so you're who NERV have sent. There's no point if they had given me the chance we could have captured this person easily. Damn NERV, always having to stick their noses in."  
“我是舰队司令，所以你是 NERV 派来的。如果他们给我机会，我们本可以轻易抓住这个人。该死的 NERV，总是要插手。”

"Sorry but…" “抱歉，但是……”

"Yeah well just don't forget you're on my ship and I'm in command of this fleet. I don't care what your government says, just don't get in our crews way and don't go down into the lower decks."  
"好吧，别忘了你在我船上，我是这支舰队的指挥官。我不在乎你的政府怎么说，只要别妨碍我们船员，也别下到下层甲板去。"

"We have authorization from NERV and the UN to have free reign of the ship tho…"  
"我们有 NERV 和联合国的授权，可以在船上自由行动……"

"Well I'm not the UN am I, while you're on my ship you abide by my rules and the lower decks are off limits. Now go and find your 'suspect'."  
"我不是联合国的人，对吧？既然你在我的船上，就得遵守我的规矩，下层甲板是禁区。现在去找你的‘嫌疑人’吧。"

Asuka glared at him trying to restrain herself from tearing the Admiral apart, luckily Kaji stepped in between them both.  
明日香瞪着他，努力克制自己不去把这位将军撕成碎片，幸好加持及时插到他们两人之间。

"We will thank you, Admiral."  
“我们会感谢你的，将军。”

They quickly made their way away from the Admiral and towards the quarters they had been temporarily assigned. Along the way Kaji decided to ask about the Shamshel incident and what happened before she arrived.  
他们迅速离开将军，朝临时分配给他们的住处走去。途中，加持决定询问关于萨姆谢尔事件以及她到达之前发生的事情。

"You know before you flew out here, I read up on the Shamshel incident."  
"你知道在你飞来这里之前，我研究了一下沙姆谢尔事件。"

Asuka raised her eyebrow and replied casually.  
明日香挑了挑眉毛，随意地回答道。

"I thought those case details weren't to be shown to anyone?"  
“我以为那些案件细节不对外公开？”

"I was granted access due to the delicate nature of this case and the previous one."  
“由于此案及前一案件的敏感性，我被授予了访问权限。”

"I see, so what did you think?"  
“我明白了，那你怎么看？”

"I was impressed with yours and Ikari's performance, capturing someone like that on what must be only your third case together is impressive."  
"我对你们和碇的表现印象深刻，仅凭第三次合作就能抓获那样的人物，真是令人钦佩。"

"Maybe, there are still a few things I don't understand about it."  
"或许吧，关于这件事我还有些地方不太明白。"

"Oh?"

"Well yeah, how come we got congratulated on the case but there was no body when I arrived. Also something about 'Agent Ayanami' doesn't add up either."  
"嗯，没错，为什么我们在案件上受到了祝贺，但我到达时却没有发现尸体。还有关于‘绫波零特工’的事情也有些不对劲。"

"Maybe you're just being paranoid."  
“或许你只是有点多疑。”

"No I'm just being cautious, Agent Ikari is the paranoid one."  
“不，我只是谨慎，碇一曹才是那个多疑的人。”

"How so?" "此话怎讲？"

"Well he seems to be finding problems everywhere, while I agree there's something wrong with the supposed 'Agent Ayanami' and various other things we've seen he wants to examine everything. He even tried to look into the guy who ran the hospital we were at."  
“嗯，他似乎在每个地方都能发现问题，虽然我也同意那个所谓的‘绫波特工’和其他我们见过的种种事情有问题，但他想检查所有东西。他甚至试图调查在我们所在的医院里那个家伙。”

"Why would he do that?"  
“他为什么要这么做？”

"Well his excuse was something didn't add up because he was the only patient there, and they got him there a bit quickly. So he decided to look up on the administrator, a Gendo Rokubungi I believe it was."  
“他的理由是有些事情说不通，因为他是那里唯一的病人，而且他们把他送去的速度有点太快了。所以他决定调查一下管理员，我想是叫源度六本木吧。”

Kaji stopped in his tracks and shot her a worried glance.  
加治停下脚步，担忧地瞥了她一眼。

"Sorry, what was that name again?"  
“抱歉，那个名字能再说一遍吗？”

"Gendo Rokubungi, I know, stupid isn't it."  
"碇源堂，我知道，真蠢对吧。"

"No, Asuka get into your quarters quickly, there's something we need to discuss about Agent Ikari."  
"不，明日香，快回你的房间，我们有关于碇指挥官的事情需要讨论。"

**Asuka's Quarters – 1130 hours  
明日香的房间 – 11 点 30 分**

She felt herself being pushed into the quarters by Kaji, he quickly turned and locked the door shut and turned to her with a worried look on his face. She took off her sunglasses and stared at him through her blue eyes.  
她感觉到自己被卡吉推进了房间，他迅速转身锁上门，然后带着一脸忧虑的表情转向她。她摘下太阳镜，用她那双蓝色的眼睛盯着他。

"Just what is this about Kaji, you're acting worse than Ikari."  
“卡吉，这到底是怎么回事？你这副样子比碇还糟糕。”

"Be quiet, this is important Asuka."  
“安静点，这很重要，明日香。”

He reached around the desk and pulled out what appeared to be a small monitoring device. Shocked, she leapt up but immediately went back down, clutching her stomach in pain.  
他绕到桌子后面，拿出一个看似小型监控设备的东西。她震惊地跳了起来，但随即又痛苦地捂着肚子坐了回去。

"Kaji… what… what is that?"  
“加持……那……那是什么？”

"It's an audio monitoring device, there's something important I have to tell you Asuka, about Mr Rokubungi and also about you."  
“这是一个音频监控设备，关于六本木先生，还有你，我有件重要的事必须告诉你，明日香。”

"What do you mean about me? I'm fine I already told you that"  
"你说的我怎么了？我很好，我已经告诉过你了"

"No Asuka you're not look, just sit on the bed I'll explain what I can."  
"不，明日香，你并不好。看，就坐在床上，我会解释我能解释的。"

He looked at her as she got to her feet and sat down on the bed holding her stomach. She jolted as pain shot through her again, she spoke, although barely whispering.  
他看着她站起身，坐在床上，双手抱着肚子。疼痛再次袭来，她猛地一颤，尽管声音微弱，她还是开口了。

"Ok, I'm listening just explain."  
"好吧，我在听，解释一下。"

"Asuka this entire thing today, Gaghiel, it's related to Shamshel and Sachiel. It's also related to what Shinji is doing in Tokyo 3 at the moment to do with a person called Ramiel, I can't explain much more than that."  
"明日香，今天发生的这一切，加吉尔，它与沙姆谢尔和萨基尔有关。这也与真嗣目前在东京 3 区所做的事情有关，涉及到一个叫拉米尔的人，我无法解释更多了。"

"What does that have to do with, Rokubungi or what's wrong with me?"  
"这与六方或我有什么问题有什么关系？"

"So you're admitting it now?"  
“所以你现在承认了？”

"I don't have any fucking choice do I, after collapsing in front of you. Just explain."  
“我没有别的狗屁选择，对吧？在你面前昏倒之后。解释一下。”

"Asuka what's happening to you is no accident, you're suffering exactly the same effects as Shinji. I don't know what is causing it but I do know that it's the same thing."  
“明日香，发生在你身上的绝非偶然，你正在遭受与真嗣完全相同的影响。我不知道是什么引起的，但我知道是同一种东西。”

"How do you… how do you know this?"  
"你怎么……你怎么知道这些？"

"I'm a little bit higher up in NERV than you've been lead to believe, I shouldn't be revealing this to you but if Shinji or Misato find out later they'll never forgive me."  
"我在 NERV 的地位比你被告知的要高一些，我不该向你透露这些，但如果真嗣或美里后来发现了，他们永远不会原谅我。"

"Find out what?" "发现什么？"

She heaved forward and nearly threw up all over the floor, Kaji put his arm around her shoulder and held her gently. Asuka forced back the tears in her eyes and let her head lie gently on his shoulder.  
她猛地前倾，差点吐得满地都是，加持将手臂搭在她肩上，温柔地搂住她。明日香强忍住眼中的泪水，轻轻地将头靠在他的肩膀上。

"Asuka, has Misato told you about Shinji's past."  
“明日香，美里跟你说过真嗣的过去吗？”

She nodded not daring to speak.  
她点点头，不敢出声。

"You know his mother died when he was young right, and his father abandoned him. Well his father was a man named Gendo Ikari."  
“你知道他母亲在他小时候就去世了，对吧，而且他父亲抛弃了他。其实，他父亲就是叫碇源堂的人。”

"What does that have to do with Gendo Rokubungi, there must be millions of people named Gendo in Japan."  
“这跟源堂六本木有什么关系，日本叫源堂的人肯定有成千上万。”

"Yes but Gendo Ikari took his wife's last name, Gendo's original name was Rokubungi. The man you saw at the hospital was Shinji..."  
“是的，但碇源堂采用了他妻子的姓氏，碇的原本姓氏是六分仪。你在医院见到的那个人是真嗣……”

She whispered the word finishing Kaji's sentence for him  
她轻声说出了那个词，替卡吉完成了句子

"...father?" "...爸爸？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"How come Shinji didn't know that his father used to be called Rokubungi?"  
"为什么真嗣不知道他父亲以前被称为六分仪？"

"Not many people do." "没多少人会这么做。"

"But why was he..." "但他为什么……"

They were cut off by a loud noise from outside the quarters, Kaji cautiously stood up and withdrew his gun. He switched the safety off and stood next to the entrance, looking in towards Asuka who was standing near him.  
一阵响亮的噪音从宿舍外传来，打断了他们的话。加持小心翼翼地站起身，拔出手枪，关闭了保险，站在入口旁，目光转向站在他附近的明日香。

"No Asuka, you stay here, phone Katsuragi and inform her we have a potential situation here and tell her what I've just told you about Rokubungi, it's important Shinji finds out. I'll go and investigate."  
"不，明日香，你留在这里，打电话给葛城，告诉她我们这里可能有情况，并且把我刚告诉你的关于六分仪的事也告诉她，让真嗣知道这件事很重要。我去调查一下。"

"I'll come with you, I'm fine now."  
"我跟你一起去，我现在没事了。"

"No you're not, I'm ranked higher than you so I'm ordering you to stay here and contact Misato."  
"不，你还没好，我的级别比你高，所以我命令你留在这里联系美里。"

"Fine I'll contact her, but if you don't come back within half an hour I'm coming after you."  
"好吧，我会联系她，但如果你半小时内不回来，我就去找你。"

"Okay, deal." "好的，成交。"

He smiled at her and opened the door and stepped out onto the deck, closing it behind him. Immediately after he left, Asuka withdrew her gun and also her cellphone, she dialed in Misato's number and made her way over to the door, opening it slightly.  
他朝她微笑，打开门，踏上了甲板，随后关上了门。他一离开，明日香立刻取出枪和手机，拨通了美里小姐的号码，并走向门口，轻轻打开了一条缝。

'_Idiot thinks I can't handle it, I'll show them all that I can handle it.'_  
'白痴以为我应付不来，我会让他们都看到我能应付得来。'

The phone rang for a few times until it was eventually picked up, she heard Misato's voice speaking as she stepped out into the corridor.  
电话响了几声后终于被接起，她听到美里声音的同时，踏出了走廊。

"_Katsuragi speaking."_ "葛城 speaking."

"It's Agent Sohryu, I'm here with Agent Kaji, look is Ikari there?"  
"我是代理索留，我和代理加持在一起，伊卡里在吗？"

_"We're inbound to his position now, why you missing him already?"  
"我们正前往他的位置，怎么，已经开始想他了？"_

"No, this is serious. Look, do not tell him this yet, Kaji has just given me some important information regarding Shinji that I think you should know."  
"不，这是严肃的事。听着，先别告诉他，加持刚刚给了我一些关于真嗣的重要信息，我觉得你应该知道。"

"_Can't it wait, we're in the middle of an operation here?"_  
"这不能等吗，我们正在执行任务呢？"

"No it can't I don't have much time, Misato listen to me, whatever you do, do not tell Shinji this."  
"不行，我没多少时间了，美里，听着，无论如何，不要告诉真嗣这件事。"

"_Okay, okay what is it?"_  
“好了，好了，是什么事？”

"Misato, Gendo Rokubungi is Shinji's fath…"  
“美里，源渡是真嗣的父亲……”

Asuka dropped the phone as she felt someone grabbing hold of her, she quickly spun round and found herself standing face to face with the Admiral from before. Without giving her a chance to do anything he swiftly delivered a kick to her stomach and sent her flying back into her quarters.  
明日香手中的电话滑落，她感到有人抓住了她，迅速转身，发现自己正面对着之前的那位上将。还没等她反应过来，他迅速一脚踢向她的腹部，将她击飞回自己的房间。

"What's the matter little girl, not feeling so confident now are you?"  
"怎么了，小姑娘，现在没那么自信了，是吗？"

"You asshole, I should have known."  
"你这个混蛋，我早该料到的。"

She pointed her gun at him and smiled, before firing a shot directly at him, immediately afterwards she felt pain shoot through her again and another wave of nausea. She threw up as she heard the man crying out in pain from the gun shot. He moved towards her and picked her up off of the floor, gripping his hand around her throat.  
她将枪口对准他，微笑着扣动了扳机，子弹直射而出。紧接着，她再次感到剧痛袭来，一阵恶心也随之涌上心头。在听到男子因枪伤而痛苦呼喊的同时，她忍不住呕吐起来。他向她走来，将她从地上抱起，一手紧紧扼住了她的喉咙。

"Look what you done, you messed up my ship you little bitch. I'll have to make you pay for that."  
"看看你干的好事，你把我的船弄得一团糟，你这个小贱人。我会让你为此付出代价的。"

He pulled the bullet out of his arm and the wound regenerated itself instantly.  
他从手臂中拔出子弹，伤口瞬间自我愈合。

"I can't believe NERV would send someone as pathetic as you after me, I suppose they didn't even tell you what I am. Just apprehend the one known as Gaghiel."  
“真不敢相信 NERV 会派你这样可怜的人来追捕我，想必他们连我是谁都没告诉你。只需逮捕那个被称为 Gaghiel 的家伙。”

"Go…to…hell." "滚…去…地…狱。"

"Didn't anyone ever tell you, Sohryu, that arrogance like that would be your downfall?"  
"难道没人告诉过你吗，龙神，那种傲慢终将导致你的失败？"

"I said… go… to… hell."  
"我说了…滚…去…地…狱。"

He stepped back for a moment and threw his fist forward towards her stomach again, only this time he was stopped. Gaghiel stepped back in shock as he looked at the barrier of light that had just formed between them.  
他后退一步，再次挥拳向她的腹部击去，但这一次却被挡住了。加吉尔震惊地后退，看着刚刚在他们之间形成的光之屏障。

"An A.T. Field, so you are one of them. Shame you're in no condition to persue me then."  
“AT 力场，原来你是他们中的一员。可惜你现在状态不佳，无法追击我。”

Asuka felt herself sliding down the wall as she watched him walking out of the room. Her vision began to blur again as she felt herself passing out, this time muttering in anger.  
看着他走出房间，明日香感到自己顺着墙壁滑落。她的视线开始模糊，再次感到昏厥，这次愤怒地喃喃自语。

"I'll kill you… I'll fucking kill you."  
“我要杀了你……我他妈要杀了你。”

**Laboratory – 1215 hours 实验室 – 12:15**

When Asuka awoke she felt the cold steel floor beneath her and realized she was no longer in her quarters. She opened her eyes and stood up, looking around at her surroundings. Above her she could hear the ships alarm going off and a chopper flying overhead. Slowly she made her way towards the exit of the room and tried to force the door open, only to find it locked.  
当明日香醒来时，她感觉到身下冰冷的钢制地板，意识到自己已不在自己的房间。她睁开眼睛，站起身来，环顾四周。头顶上，她能听到船上的警报声和头顶飞过的直升机声。她慢慢地向房间的出口走去，试图强行打开门，却发现门被锁住了。

A cold shudder ran down her spine and she turned around, trying to look for another way out. All around the room tables with various vials and various laboratory equipment, it immediately hit her.  
一阵寒意沿着她的脊背滑下，她转过身，试图寻找另一条出路。房间里到处都是摆满各种试管和实验室设备的桌子，她立刻明白了。

'_This is why he didn't want us in the lower decks'_  
'这就是他不想让我们进入下层甲板的原因'

Asuka made her way over to one of the tables and examined the vial, inside was a strange yet oddly familiar orange liquid. On it the label read 'LCL Sample #132' accompanying the words was the seven eyed logo she had already seen so many times in the past. The memories of the past few weeks rushed through her mind, Sachiel, The Medical facility, Shamshel, Shinji's father, the attack by Gaghiel and now this. She put the vial into her pocket and reached around for her pistol.  
明日香走向一张桌子，仔细端详着试管，里面是一种既陌生又莫名熟悉的橙色液体。标签上写着“LCL 样本#132”，旁边是那个她过去已见过无数次的七眼标志。过去几周的记忆涌入脑海：萨基尔、医疗设施、夏姆榭尔、真嗣的父亲、加吉尔的袭击，以及现在这个。她将试管放入口袋，伸手去摸自己的手枪。

"Looking for something, Agent Sohryu?"  
“在找什么东西吗，索留香探员？”

She spun around trying to locate the source of the voice.  
她转过身来，试图找到声音的来源。

"What is this place?" “这是什么地方？”

"This is where the future of mankind is held Miss Sohryu, one of many locations. You've already visited two so recently."  
“这就是人类未来的所在，草薙小姐，众多地点之一。你最近已经访问过两个了。”

"What are you talking about?"  
"你在说什么呢？"

"Oh come, surely you remember, the location where you were turned into one of us, where you and Agent Ikari killed two of my brethren."  
“哦，别这样，你肯定记得，那个你被转化成我们一员的地方，你和碇探员在那里杀死了我的两个同伴。”

"Turned into one of you, I'm nothing like you."  
"变成了你们中的一员，我与你们截然不同。"

"We're more alike than you imagine Agent Sohryu, we're strong while everyone else is weak. We're evolving while everyone else is stagnating, we are the new breed of humanity."  
"我们比你想象的更为相似，草薙特工。我们强大而他人弱小，我们在进化而他人停滞不前，我们是人类的新品种。"

"I am nothing like you."  
“我与你截然不同。”

"Believe what you will, but you are turning your back on a great opportunity. If it is death you truly desire though, I shall grant it."  
“随你信不信，但你正在错失一个绝佳的机会。若你真渴望死亡，我会成全你。”

She spun around just in time to find Gaghiel running towards her, taking her down to the ground, he quickly got back up and taunted her.  
她及时转身，发现加吉尔正朝她冲来，将她扑倒在地，随即迅速起身并嘲弄她。

"What's wrong Sohryu, can't use your A.T. Field?"  
"怎么了，苏流，用不了你的 A.T.力场吗？"

He delivered a swift kick to her stomach, causing her to double over in pain. She swung her arm around trying to fight back but he quickly swept it away. In one quick motion he picked her up by her hair and threw her onto one of the lab tables. She felt the cracks of the test tubes and equipment breaking beneath her as she screamed out in pain.  
他猛地一脚踢向她的腹部，让她痛苦地弯下了腰。她挥动手臂试图反击，但他迅速将其扫开。他迅速地揪住她的头发，将她甩到一张实验台上。她感觉到身下的试管和设备碎裂的声音，痛苦地尖叫起来。

"What's the matter little girl, no mommy to save you?"  
“怎么了，小姑娘，没有妈妈来救你了吗？”

Asuka felt him grab her by the wrist and slide her off, his words echoing in her mind. She felt rage burning away inside her, turned towards him and using as much strength as she could pulled him towards her.  
明日香感到他抓住她的手腕，将她推开，他的话在她脑海中回响。她感到内心的愤怒在燃烧，转身面对他，用尽全力将他拉向自己。

"Die you bastard." "去死吧，混蛋。"

She screamed out as he went to deliver another punch to her, only to be blocked by the barrier of light. He looked up at her, stunned as she walked towards him, delving a kick of her down directly to the man's face, blood splattered everywhere as the man taunted her.  
她尖叫着，当他再次挥拳向她时，却被一道光之屏障挡住了。他抬头看着她，惊愕中，她走向他，一脚狠狠踢向那人的脸，鲜血四溅，那人却还在嘲弄她。

"Now that's more like it, come on Sohryu, use your A.T. Field, show me what you've got."  
“这才像话，来吧，惣流，用你的 A.T.力场，让我看看你的本事。”

She snarled and leapt at him, delivering blow after blow to his head, she was lost in a frenzy of attacks. He grabbed hold of her by the throat and threw her back towards the table, she hit it with full force, the sound of her body hitting the cold steel echoing around the room. Asuka turned to her side, coughing up blood. Feeling him getting closer she felt around for anything to stop his brutal attack, she clambered around the lab table and found a vial of the LCL. Without thinking she smashed it directly into his forehead and into one of his eyes.  
她咆哮着向他扑去，对着他的头部连续猛击，陷入了一阵狂暴的攻击中。他抓住她的喉咙，将她甩向桌子，她重重地撞在冰冷的钢板上，身体撞击的声音在房间里回荡。明日香侧身躺着，咳出血来。感觉到他越来越近，她四处摸索着任何能阻止他残暴攻击的东西，她爬过实验室的桌子，找到了一瓶 LCL。不假思索地，她将瓶子直接砸向他的额头，碎片刺入了他的眼睛。

Blood was flowing freely down the mans face as he stumbled backwards trying to see, she felt blood trickling down her own hand from the glass going in but she didn't care. All she wanted to do was kill the person in front of her, she moved towards him and reached out with her hands and clasped them tightly around his throat, repeating the same sentence.  
鲜血从男人的脸上自由流淌，他踉跄后退试图看清，她感到玻璃碎片刺入自己的手，血流不止，但她毫不在意。她只想杀死眼前的人，她向他走去，双手紧紧掐住他的喉咙，重复着同一句话。

"I'll kill you, I'll kill you"  
“我要杀了你，我要杀了你”

After several minutes of standing there with her hands clamped around his neck she felt his body stiffen and slump to the floor. She immediately let go and stumbled backwards, pain shooting through her. Her hands stung from the glass shards stuck inside and blood was trickling from her mouth, but she didn't care. Slowly she made her way over to the door and back up towards the ships deck.  
她双手紧扼他的脖子，站了几分钟后，感觉到他的身体僵硬并瘫倒在地。她立刻松手，踉跄后退，疼痛贯穿全身。她的手因嵌入的玻璃碎片而刺痛，血从嘴角渗出，但她毫不在意。她缓缓走向门口，再一步步回到船甲板上。

**Hanger – 1245 hours 机库 – 1245 时**

"Agent Sohryu!" “索留香特工！”

She spun around towards where the voice was coming from and looked over towards the hanger. Standing next to a waiting chopper was Misato and Shinji. Slowly making her way towards them she looked around for any sign of Kaji. Unable to see him she began to move quicker towards them both and immediately wrapped her arms around Shinji, nearly collapsing to the floor.  
她转身朝声音来源的方向望去，目光投向了机库。站在一架待命的直升机旁的是美里和真嗣。她缓缓向他们走去，四处张望寻找加持的踪影。没看到他，她便加快脚步向他们两人走去，立刻张开双臂紧紧抱住真嗣，差点瘫倒在地。

Shinji, unsure of what to do, put his arm's around her and embraced her tightly, then something strange happened. He felt her slipping something inside his inside jacket pocket. She let go of him and looked into his eyes giving him a knowing smile, he simply smiled back.  
真嗣不知所措，伸出双臂拥她入怀，紧紧抱住，随后发生了件奇怪的事。他感觉到她在往他夹克内袋里塞东西。她松开他，凝视着他的眼睛，露出了一个会心的微笑，他只是回以微笑。

"What happened down there, you're a mess?"  
“下面发生了什么，你弄得这么狼狈？”

""I… was attacked by Gaghiel, he was on board as the Admiral. He's down in the lab's now."  
""我…被 Gaghiel 袭击了，他当时以海军上将的身份在船上。他现在在实验室里。""

"I see, I'll go and check, you two stay here."  
""我明白了，我去检查一下，你们俩留在这里。""

Misato ran off towards the lab's, leaving the two of them standing there in complete silence. Asuka felt her eyes going heavy so she sat down inside the chopper, Shinji followed her with a concerned look.  
美里朝实验室跑去，留下他们两人站在那里，四周一片死寂。明日香感到眼皮沉重，便坐进了直升机里，真嗣带着关切的神情跟着她。

"Are you alright?" “你还好吗？”

"Not you as well, I'm fine, there's nothing wrong with me."  
“连你也这样，我没事，我一点问题都没有。”

"Of course there is, you're bleeding Sohryu."  
当然有，你可是龙族的草薙呀。

It's nothing I'll get it seen to when we get back. Agent Ikari, did Misato give you my message?"  
没什么大碍，我们回去后我会处理。碇警官，美里把我的口信带到了吗？

"No, she just said there was an incident here, why what message?"  
“不，她只说这里发生了件事，什么消息？”

She breathed deeply knowing she had to tell him, she reached out and pulled him towards her and sat him down.  
她深吸一口气，知道必须告诉他，于是伸出手将他拉向自己，让他坐下。

"Shinji, Gendo Rokubungi… he's your father."  
“真嗣，碇源堂……他是你的父亲。”

### Chapter 9 Impact

_30th December 2000 2000 年 12 月 30 日_

**Japanese Government Facility – 2330hours  
日本政府设施 – 23 时 30 分**

"What is the status on Adam?"  
“亚当的情况如何？”

"He is…stable at the moment, we currently have him sedated and our computers are also tracking the other specimens. We are ready to move onto phase two of the operation, if you would like to come with me, Director."  
“他目前……稳定，我们已给他注射了镇静剂，电脑也在追踪其他样本。如果您愿意，主任，我们可以进入手术的第二阶段。”

"Of course." "当然可以。"

The director stood up and took one final look around his office and smiled at the man who stood at the other side of the room. A light from one of the choppers overhead shone through the window illuminating the entire room, he took a step forward and made his way out into the corridor, continuing his conversation with the man.  
主任站起身，最后环顾了一遍办公室，对着房间另一侧的人微笑。一架直升机上的灯光透过窗户照亮了整个房间，他向前迈了一步，走出走廊，继续与那人交谈。

"Is Keel still here?" "基尔还在这里吗？"

"No Sir, Keel and the rest of the committee left just over an hour ago."  
"不，长官，基尔和委员会的其他成员一个多小时前就离开了。"

"So they are not staying to see the beginning?"  
"这么说他们不留下来看开场了？"

"They are watching from a location outside of Tokyo 3, just in case one of the specimens returns."  
"他们正在东京 3 区外的一个地点观察，以防万一某个样本返回。"

"Of course, they would want to play it safe."  
"当然，他们想要确保安全。"

They made their way into one of the facilities laboratories, this laboratory was the largest within the facility, along the walls were tanks filled with an orange liquid and inside were various humanoids in different stages of growth. The director stopped when they passed by one tank, inside was a fourteen year old girl, her blue hair shimmered in the orange liquid. He reached up and began typing on the keypad next to the tank, the man accompanying stopped and looked at him.  
他们走进了设施中的一个实验室，这个实验室是设施内最大的，沿着墙壁排列着装满橙色液体的罐子，里面是处于不同成长阶段的各种人形生物。当他们经过一个罐子时，主任停了下来，里面是一个十四岁的女孩，她的蓝发在橙色液体中闪烁。他伸手开始在罐子旁边的键盘上输入，陪同的男子停下来看着他。

"Sir what are you doing? SEELE's instructions were to leave everything here and resume the genetic modification procedures elsewhere."  
"先生，您在做什么？SEELE 的指示是留下这里的一切，转移到其他地方继续基因改造程序。"

"SEELE aren't here are they?"  
"SEELE 不在这里，对吧？"

"No but still we can…"  
"是的，但他们仍然可以……"

He was cut off suddenly when the director pulled a gun out and pointed it at him, he turned to face him. The director spoke again this time sounding fiercer.  
当他突然被导演打断，对方掏出枪指向他时，他转过身来面对导演。这次导演的声音听起来更加凶狠。

"If you wish to stop me go ahead, I think you'll find however that the people left here are under my command and not SEELE's."  
“如果你想阻止我，尽管试试，不过你会发现，这里剩下的人都是听命于我，而非 SEELE。”

"Sir if you do that I'll have to inform Ke…"  
“先生，如果您这么做，我必须通知碇……”

The sound of the shot echoed around the laboratory as the man slumped to the ground, blood pouring from the gunshot wound. As the director finished putting in the commands on the keypad another person stepped into the area, this time a brown haired scientist. She looked at the body on the floor and then to the director and smiled.  
枪声在实验室中回荡，那人应声倒地，鲜血从枪伤处涌出。当导演在键盘上输入完指令后，又一个人走进了这片区域，这次是一位棕色头发的科学家。她看了看地板上的尸体，又转向导演，微笑着。

"Did he try to stop you?"  
“他试图阻止你吗？”

"He threatened to tell Keel"  
“他威胁要告诉基尔”

"Unfortunate, I'm sure he would have made a good test subject for Project E."  
"不幸的是，我确信他本可以成为‘E 计划’的优秀实验对象。"

"You will have plenty of test subjects later Naoko, why are you here?"  
"之后你会有很多实验对象的，直子，你来这里做什么？"

"I came to find you, Fuyutsuki is at the chopper with my daughter. We're preparing to leave the facility."  
"我来找你，冬月和我的女儿在直升机那里。我们正准备离开设施。"

"Tell them I will be along in a minute, there is something I must do."  
"告诉他们我一会儿就过去，有些事情我必须处理。"

Naoko looked at him and then to the tank he was opening, a look of disgust appeared across her face, but she quickly disguised it. She turned and made her way out of the laboratory, leaving the director and the person he was helping out of the tank.  
直子看了看他，又看向他正在打开的水槽，脸上露出了厌恶的表情，但她很快掩饰了过去。她转身离开了实验室，留下主任和那个刚从水槽里出来的人。

"Rei, we're leaving." "丽，我们要走了。"

"Yes sir." "是，长官。"

He took off his jacket and gave it to the young girl to put on and they quickly moved out of the laboratory. A few moments later they were outside on the roof of the facility, a chopper waiting for them along with three other people. Naoko, a young blonde haired girl and an older grey haired man. The man stepped forward and spoke to the director.  
他脱下夹克递给年轻女孩穿上，两人迅速离开了实验室。片刻后，他们来到了设施的屋顶，一架直升机正等待着他们，还有另外三个人在场：直子、一位金发少女和一个灰白头发的老人。老人走上前，对指挥官说道。

"Director Ikari, quickly, we don't have much time."  
“碇司令，快，我们时间不多了。”

"Of course Fuyutsuki, I was just getting Rei."  
“当然，冬月，我刚在带绫波。”

Fuyutsuki looked down at the Blue Haired girl who was wearing only Ikari's jackets and frowned slightly.  
冬月低头看着那个只穿着碇的外套的蓝发女孩，微微皱起了眉。

"Ikari, you know Keel will not be pleased with this."  
"碇，你知道基尔不会对此感到高兴的。"

"Of course I do, but we cannot afford to leave Rei behind. She is the key to project E."  
"当然知道，但我们不能把绫波留在这里。她是 E 计划的关键。"

"I understand, was a survivor chosen?"  
"我明白，有幸存者被选中了吗？"

"Yes a young woman, the daughter of one of the head scientists here, Dr Katsuragi's daughter. All has been taken care of and the beacons are set up, all we have to do now is activate Adam."  
“是的，一位年轻女性，是这里一位首席科学家的女儿，碇博士的女儿。一切都已经安排妥当，信标也已设置完毕，我们现在只需激活亚当。”

"Doctor Akagi has the Magi system logged in and ready, we will activate when we reach the outskirts of Tokyo."  
“赤木博士已经登录了 MAGI 系统并准备就绪，我们将在抵达东京郊区时激活。”

"Lets proceed then." “那我们继续吧。”

_16th May 2015 2015 年 5 月 16 日_

**Katsuragi Residence – 1720 hours  
葛城宅邸 —— 17 时 20 分**

"_2015 marks the fifteenth year since the 'Impact Incident' a deadly explosion which took out most of Old Tokyo. It is believed the explosion was caused by a malfunction at the Gehirn research facilities in the heart of Tokyo, however even to this day scientists have not been able to return to Tokyo due to the radiation that surrounds the area and the city itself._  
2015 年标志着'冲击事件'发生十五周年，这是一场致命的爆炸，摧毁了旧东京的大部分地区。据信，爆炸是由东京心脏地带的 Gehirn 研究设施故障引起的，然而，即使到了今天，科学家们仍因该地区及城市周围的辐射而无法返回东京。

_The Japanese Prime Minister has recently made preparations for a special memorial service on the 30th December to mark the 15th Anniversary of the incident many are calling the biggest disaster in human history. The entire city of Tokyo was turned into a ghost town with no survivors…."  
日本首相近日为 12 月 30 日举行的特别纪念仪式做准备，以纪念许多人称之为人类历史上最大灾难的 15 周年。整个东京市变成了无人区，无一幸存……_

Misato switched the TV off and threw the remote down to the floor sighing to herself.  
美里关掉电视，将遥控器扔到地板上，自言自语地叹了口气。

'_Yeah...no survivors except one.'_  
'是啊...除了一个，没有幸存者。'

She made her way into the kitchen and pulled another beer out of the fridge, she gazed over towards Shinji's room as she took a seat at the table. Despite them living together again she had barely heard from Shinji since they got back from the Over The Rainbow. She had seen him at NERV but they barely exchanged words, Misato knew it was because of what Asuka told him.  
她走进厨房，从冰箱里又拿出一罐啤酒，目光扫向真嗣的房间，然后坐到餐桌旁。尽管他们再次同居，但自从从彩虹之上回来后，她几乎没怎么听到真嗣的消息。她在 NERV 见过他，但他们几乎没怎么交谈，美里知道这是因为明日香对他说了些什么。

'_He's just like he was thirteen years ago, shutting himself away and not talking to anyone, he's barely spoke to me at work and he only comes out for dinner. He's twenty seven not fourteen, he needs to learn to deal with this.'_  
“他还是和十三年前一样，把自己关起来，不和任何人说话，在单位几乎没和我交流过，只有吃饭时才出来。他已经二十七岁了，不是十四岁，他需要学会处理这些事情。”

Misato stood up and made her way over to the door, she tapped on it lightly and spoke through it.  
美里站起身，走向门口，轻轻敲了敲门，对着门内说道。

"Shinji, I'm coming inside."  
“真嗣，我要进来了。”

There was no response so she slowly opened the door and peered inside, the room was just as tidy as it was when Shinji arrived. She looked over towards the bed and looked on in shock when she realized Shinji was not there. His possessions were still in the sports bag on the bed but Shinji had left. Tears burnt the back of her eyes as she looked around whispering to herself.  
没有回应，于是她缓缓推开门，向内窥视，房间依旧如新，和真嗣刚来时一样整洁。她朝床的方向望去，震惊地发现真嗣并不在那里。他的物品仍放在床上的运动包里，但真嗣已经离开了。泪水在她的眼眶后灼烧，她环顾四周，低声自语。

"No… don't do this to yourself Shinji."  
“不……别这样对自己，真嗣。”

Wiping her eyes on her sleeve she made her way back into the kitchen and picked up her cellphone dialing in Asuka's number. It rang for a few times before she picked up.  
她用袖子擦了擦眼睛，回到厨房，拿起手机拨通了明日香的号码。电话响了几声后，她接了起来。

"_Hello."_ “你好。”

"Agent Sohryu, its Katsuragi have you seen Shinji today?"  
“碇君，我是葛城，你今天见到真嗣了吗？”

"_No, you guys still won't let me go back to work remember, something to do with the injuries I got and subsequently healed from."_  
“没有，你们还是不让我回去工作，记得吗，是因为我受的伤虽然痊愈了，但还是有问题。”

"Sorry I forgot, have you heard from him at all?"  
"对不起，我忘了，你有他的消息吗？"

"_No. Why what's happened?"_  
"没有。怎么了，发生什么事了吗？"

"He's run away again?" 他又跑掉了？

"_What do you mean again?"_  
"你又是什么意思？"

"When I first took him in thirteen years ago I quickly found out that if something was troubling him he would run away from the problem. He did it a few times before I finally managed to convince him to face his problems, but after what you told him I think he's started again."  
"十三年前我第一次收留他时，很快就发现，如果有什么事困扰他，他会逃避问题。他这样做过几次，直到我最终说服他面对问题。但自从你告诉他那些事后，我觉得他又开始了。"

"_How do you know he has run away, maybe he's working late or something?"_  
"你怎么知道他跑了，也许他加班或者什么的？"

"No he wasn't at work today, he wasn't here when I woke up, and his stuff is still in the bag on his bed, he hasn't been in there since yesterday."  
"不，他今天没上班，我醒来时他就不在，他的东西还在床上的包里，从昨天起他就没碰过。"

"_Well he's an adult it's up to him, if the idiot is going to do that then it's up to him."_  
"好吧，他是成年人了，他要是那么蠢，那就随他去吧。"

"I know but I just get the feeling he's in trouble."  
我知道，但我就是有种感觉，他遇上麻烦了。

"_Have you tried contacting him?"_  
"你试过联系他吗？"

"Yeah, but his cell phone is switched off."  
"试过了，但他的手机关机了。"

From the other end Misato heard Asuka sighing heavily.  
从另一端，美里听到明日香重重地叹了口气。

"_He's probably with Wondergirl."_  
他大概和神奇女孩在一起。

"Wondergirl?" “奇迹女孩？”

"_Yeah Agent Ayanami, I'm going to start calling her that because I'm still wondering who the hell she is and how she got away with attacking me."_  
“是啊，绫波零特工，我打算这么称呼她了，因为我还在纳闷她到底是谁，又是怎么逃脱袭击我的罪责的。”

"Agent Sohryu please be serious I'm worried about him, I think what you said to him messed him up."  
草薙特工，请认真些，我很担心他，我觉得你对他说的话让他心烦意乱了。

"_More than he already is you mean?"_  
“你是说比现在更甚？”

Misato was now nearly shouting down the phone, trying her best not to break down.  
美里现在几乎是冲着电话大喊，竭尽全力不让自己崩溃。

"Agent Sohryu!" “索留香特工！”

"_Okay I'm sorry, but I'm not taking the blame for saying that. He needed to be told if I didn't tell him, no one else would have."_  
“好吧，我很抱歉，但我不会为那句话承担责任。他需要知道真相，如果我不告诉他，没人会说的。”

"You were too blunt though, you saw what he was like on the flight back."  
“但你太直接了，你看到他回来时的样子了。”

"_Look I'll meet you at the offices okay? We'll see if he's been there, but you need to stop treating him like a kid, despite being an idiot he is capable of handling himself."_  
"听着，我会在办公室那边跟你碰头，好吗？我们看看他有没有去过那里，但你得停止把他当小孩对待，尽管他是个傻瓜，但他有能力照顾自己。"

"I suppose you're right, I'll meet you there in half an hour then."  
"我想你是对的，那我半小时后在那儿见你。"

_30th December 2000 2000 年 12 月 30 日_

**Streets of Tokyo -2350 hours  
东京街头 -2350 小时**

A huge explosion rocked the street as a young Misato Katsuragi stumbled out of her apartment block. She looked out towards the center of the city, entire buildings had collapsed and smoke poured from those still standing. She stumbled onto the street and was suddenly swept into the crowd of moving people, all of them racing in a panicked frenzy trying to get out of the city.  
一声巨响震撼了街道，年轻的葛城美里跌跌撞撞地从公寓楼里跑出来。她望向市中心，整片建筑已经倒塌，烟雾从那些依然矗立的楼宇中滚滚而出。她踉跄地走上街头，突然被卷入了涌动的人群中，所有人都在惊慌失措地狂奔，试图逃离这座城市。

As she tried to keep up with the crowd she felt something shoving her out of the way, she quickly fell to the floor screaming out in pain. She scrambled over to the side of the street as best she could to try to avoid being trampled on by the thousands moving through the city. She looked out towards the center and saw a huge pillar of light hovering over a building, she blinked and then looked on in fear realizing just what the light was hovering over.  
当她试图跟上人群时，突然感觉有人将她推开，她迅速跌倒在地，痛苦地尖叫。她尽可能地爬到街边，试图避免被成千上万涌过城市的人踩踏。她望向市中心，看到一道巨大的光柱悬浮在一栋建筑上，她眨了眨眼，然后惊恐地意识到那光柱正悬浮在何处。

'_GEHIRN… FATHER!'_ '大脑…父亲！'

She rushed back out onto the street and tried to make her way towards the light only to be dragged along by the crowd again. Suddenly the light vanished and the sound of a huge explosion tore through the sky, everyone on the street began screaming even louder. Misato stood on watching as flames and smoke rose from the area where the light previously was.  
她急忙冲回街上，试图向那束光的方向前进，却又被人群拖着走。突然间，光芒消失了，一声巨大的爆炸声撕裂了天空，街上的人们尖叫声更加刺耳。美里站在那里，看着火焰和浓烟从光芒曾经所在的地方升起。

'_No… please don't let it be GEHIRN'_  
'不…请不要是 GEHIRN'

Several more explosions sounded off all around her as she tried her best to fight through the streets towards where Gehirn was located. All around her people were screaming, women, men, children, all of them screaming and running. She moved onto one of the main roads and straight into another crowd of people, a white flash tore through the sky causing everyone to stop and stare towards the center of Toyko. Two of what appeared to be lightning bolts were coming down from the sky, they broke into what seemed to be wings. Misato looked up at this beautiful yet disturbing image, more explosions tore through the city, this time even closer to Misato's location.  
更多的爆炸声在她周围响起，她竭尽全力穿过街道，向 GEHIRN 所在的地方前进。四周的人们都在尖叫，女人、男人、孩子，所有人都在尖叫和奔跑。她走到一条主干道上，直接撞进另一群人中，一道白光划破天空，让所有人都停下脚步，望向东京的中心。天空中似乎有两道闪电落下，它们分裂成看似翅膀的形状。美里抬头看着这美丽却又令人不安的景象，更多的爆炸声在城市中响起，这次离美里的位置更近了。

A huge sound was heard overhead as a light swept through the street, similar to a helicopters spotlight. Misato covered her eyes as the light shone directly in her eyes getting closer. A rumbling sound could be heard above her as the light stopped moving directly over the street. Everyone at that moment looked up at the huge object which was above them, Misato being no exception. She closed her eyes as she felt herself being pulled upwards by some strange external force.  
头顶传来一声巨响，一道光束扫过街道，宛如直升机的探照灯。光直射入美里眼中，越来越近，她不禁用手遮住双眼。上方传来隆隆声，光束停止移动，悬停在街道正上方。那一刻，所有人都抬头望向头顶的庞然大物，美里也不例外。她闭上眼，感到一股奇异的外力将自己向上拉扯。

'_What... What is happening to me?'_  
'我...我这是怎么了？'

_17th May 2015 2015 年 5 月 17 日_

**NERV Offices – 1750 hours  
NERV 办公室 —— 17 时 50 分**

Lightning flashed through the sky as Misato brought her car to a halt in the NERV carpark, she stepped out the car and looked across the parking lot and noticed Asuka's car parked nearby. She breathed a sigh of relief and quickly made her way into the building and down towards the offices. When she opened the door to the office she found Asuka stood over by Shinji's desk looking through documents and sipping from a cup of coffee. She looked down as Asuka's bandaged hand from two days ago and frowned.  
闪电划破天际，美里将车停在 NERV 的停车场，她走出车门，环视着停车场，注意到明日香的车就停在附近。她松了一口气，迅速走进大楼，朝办公室走去。当她推开办公室的门时，发现明日香站在真嗣的桌旁，翻阅着文件，啜饮着一杯咖啡。她低头看向明日香两天前包扎的手，皱起了眉头。

"Agent Sohryu, glad you could make it."  
“草薙少尉，很高兴你能来。”

Asuka turned towards her and nodded and then looked back at the documents before taking another sip from the cup. Misato watched her unsure of what to say instead she just watched the woman as an uneasy silence fell upon the room. It was eventually broken by Asuka speaking.  
明日香转向她，点了点头，然后又回头看向文件，再次啜饮了一口咖啡。美里注视着她，不知该说什么，只是静静地观察着，房间里弥漫着一种不安的沉默。最终，明日香打破了沉默。

"He's been here." "他来过这里。"

"How do you know?" "你怎么知道的？"

"All the files from the recent cases Sachiel, Shamshel, Ramiel even what just happened to me on the Over The Rainbow were all here on his desk. He's got profiles of both Gendo Rokubungi and Gendo Ikari, I know what you're going to say but I'm still not taking the blame for him running off, would you preferred for him not to have found out?"  
"最近的几起案件，萨基尔、沙姆谢尔、拉米尔，甚至我刚在彩虹之上经历的那件事，所有文件都在他的桌上。他还有源堂六分仪和源堂真嗣两人的档案。我知道你想说什么，但我不会为此承担他跑掉的责任，难道你希望他没发现这些吗？"

Misato looked at her and shook her head as a tear rolled down her face.  
美里看着她，摇了摇头，一滴泪水顺着脸颊滑落。

"Agent Soh… Asuka I'm sorry for blaming you… I just… I don't know what to do…"  
"代理副长……明日香，对不起，我之前责怪了你……我只是……不知道该怎么办……"

Asuka looked at her and felt uneasy as the woman broke down crying before her, she walked over and put her arm around Misato and led her towards one of the seats in the room.  
明日香看着她，感到不安，因为那女人在她面前崩溃哭泣，她走过去，伸出胳膊搂住美里，带她走向房间里的一个座位。

"It's alright, I'll find the idiot even if I have to travel all around Japan."  
"没事的，我会找到那个笨蛋的，哪怕要走遍整个日本。"

Misato looked up at her and looked at her quizzically.  
美里抬头看着她，眼神中带着疑惑。

"You don't have to do all that…"  
“你不必做这些的……”

"No I do, because I'm sure as hell not getting stuck here with you being depressed and me having to work with Wondergirl, at least Shinji hasn't attacked me."  
“不，我必须做，因为我绝对不想被困在这里，和你一起沮丧，还要和明日香一起工作，至少真嗣还没攻击我。”

Misato wiped her eyes on her sleeve and looked at Asuka smiling slightly, Asuka however was still frowning.  
美里用袖子擦了擦眼睛，看着微微一笑的明日香，然而明日香依旧皱着眉头。

"Thank you, I really appreciate this."  
“谢谢你，我真的很感激。”

"It's alright don't get upset over it, like I said the idiot can handle himself."  
“没事的，别为这事生气，就像我说的，那傻瓜能照顾好自己。”

"Asuka why do you keep calling him an idiot, from what you said the other day when you got back from the Over The Rainbow you were starting to agree with some of he said."  
“明日香，你为什么一直叫他白痴？那天你从彩虹桥回来时，不是开始同意他的一些说法了吗？”

"That's not the reason, the reason I'm calling him an idiot is because of what he done."  
“那不是原因，我叫他白痴是因为他做的事。”

She couldn't help herself but a slight grin crept onto Misato's face as looked at Asuka.  
她忍不住，一丝微笑悄悄爬上了美里看着明日香的脸庞。

"You're concerned about him aren't you?"  
"你担心他，对吧？"

Asuka immediately turned red and replied back fiercely.  
明日香立刻脸红了，语气激烈地回道。

"Don't be stupid Misato, I'm only helping you so I don't have to get randomly attacked by Agent Ayanami. Yes, I said I agreed with some of what he has said but that doesn't mean I'm going to start getting concerned about him because of something like this."  
"别犯傻了，美里，我帮你只是为了避免被绫波零特工随便攻击。没错，我是说过我同意他的一些观点，但这并不意味着我会因为这种事就开始关心他。"

"He likes you, you know?"  
"你知道吗，他喜欢你？"

Misato grinned as she watched Asuka growing even redder then before, despite her concern for Shinji it was providing her some relief teasing Asuka like this.  
美里咧嘴笑着，看着明日香的脸比之前更红了，尽管她对真嗣的担忧，但这样逗弄明日香确实让她感到些许宽慰。

"Well so he should, after all to be able to work with someone like me… hold on a minute what do you mean he likes me?"  
“嗯，他当然应该，毕竟能和我这样的人一起工作……等等，你说的他喜欢我是什么意思？”

"He told me the night he was came to live with me after his apartment was burnt down, he said he was worried something might happen to you and that he was enjoying working with you. It was he who got the chopper to come and pick you up from the Over The Rainbow as well, he was with Rei in the ambulance but when he heard something had gone wrong he left and immediately had it fly out to help you."  
“他搬来和我住的那晚告诉我的，就在他的公寓被烧毁之后。他说他担心你可能会出事，而且他很享受和你一起工作。也是他叫来直升机从‘彩虹之上’接你回家的，他和丽在救护车上，但一听说出了问题，他就立刻离开并让直升机飞出去救你。”

"That doesn't mean anything, I'm sure any other Agent would have done the same for the person they worked with and what do you mean his flat was burnt down?"  
"那并不意味着什么，我相信任何其他特工会为他们的搭档做同样的事情，你说的他的公寓被烧毁是什么意思？"

"He didn't tell you?" "他没告诉你吗？"

"No, he hasn't spoken to me since I told him about his father."  
"没有，自从我告诉他关于他父亲的事情后，他就没再和我说话。"

"On the night you left Tokyo 3, a car pulled up outside Shinji's apartment block and broke into his room. Agent Ayanami was able to rescue him and bring him to my flat but the people burnt the entire block down in the process."  
"在你离开东京 3 区的那个晚上，一辆车停在了真嗣的公寓楼外，闯入了他的房间。绫波零特工成功救出了他并带他到了我的公寓，但那些人在过程中烧毁了整栋楼。"

Asuka thought for a moment and looked back to Shinji's desk and the documents on there. She glanced through the Shamshel documents looking for something, Misato shot her a confused glance when Asuka threw the documents down in frustration.  
明日香思索片刻，回头看向真嗣的书桌和上面的文件。她快速翻阅着沙姆沙尔文件，寻找着什么，当明日香沮丧地将文件扔下时，美里投去了困惑的目光。

"They're gone." "它们不见了。"

"What are?" “什么？”

"The documents of the liquid samples we took during the Shamshel case."  
"我们在沙姆谢尔案件期间采集的液体样本文件。"

"What, how? Do you think Shinji took them?"  
"什么，怎么？你觉得是真嗣拿走了它们？"

"I don't know I want to see Shinji's apartment block."  
"我不知道，我想看看真嗣的公寓楼。"

"Do you think he'll have returned there?"  
“你觉得他会已经回去了吗？”

"No, but I want to see if something has been there."  
“不，但我想看看那里是否有什么东西。”

**Shinji's Apartment – 1800 hours  
真嗣的公寓 —— 18:00**

"Agent Sohryu I don't think NERV are going to be too happy with you stealing that lab equipment."  
“草薙特工，我想 NERV 不会太高兴你偷走那些实验室设备的。”

"I'll pay for it later, besides I'm not stealing it, we're investigating the disappearance of an Agent."  
“我之后会赔偿的，再说了，我不是偷，我们是在调查一名特工的失踪。”

Asuka shot Misato a cocky grin and stepped out of the car and looked at the building in front of her. Just as Misato said, it had been practically destroyed after those people burnt it down. She wondered just what they had used as the smell of the fire still hung heavily in the air, mixed in with the dampness from the pouring rain. Asuka made a personal note to get out of here as soon as possible. She ran into the alleyway where Misato said Shinji and Rei had been attacked by two of the men. She got down on her hands and knees, looking around the debris from the building, Misato followed her, wondering what the red headed girl was planning.  
明日香向美里投去一个得意的笑容，然后走出了汽车，抬头看向眼前的建筑。正如美里所说，这座建筑在那些人纵火焚烧后几乎被彻底摧毁。她好奇他们究竟用了什么，因为火灾的气味依然浓重，与倾盆大雨带来的湿气混合在一起。明日香暗自决定尽快离开这里。她跑进美里所说的那条小巷，那里是真嗣和绫波被两名男子袭击的地方。她跪在地上，双手撑地，在建筑残骸中四处寻找，美里紧随其后，好奇这位红发女孩的计划。

"Agent Sohryu, what are you looking for?"  
“草薙少尉，你在找什么？”

Asuka withdrew the equipment she had brought with her and began collecting from what seemed to be a small puddle of orange liquid. Misato asked her again what she was doing.  
明日香拿出随身携带的设备，开始从一小滩橙色液体中采集样本。美里再次询问她在做什么。

"Agent Sohryu, what is that stuff?"  
"草薙特工，那是什么东西？"

"I don't know, but it's been present at most of the cases me and Agent Ikari have worked on. It was present at the Sachiel case, the Shamshel case, and it was on the ship when I was with Gaghiel. I've ran so many tests on it but the results are always inconclusive, from what I can tell it's very close to human blood but there's something inside it that makes it different."  
"我不清楚，但它在我们和碇特工处理的大多数案件中都有出现。在萨基尔案件、沙姆谢尔案件中都有它的踪迹，甚至在和加吉尔一起在船上时也发现了它。我进行了无数次测试，但结果总是无法得出结论，据我所知，它非常接近人类血液，但里面有些东西让它与众不同。"

"Like what?" "比如什么？"

"I don't know, I was recruited to NERV before I finished all my medical training."  
"我不知道，我在完成所有医学训练之前就被招募进了 NERV。"

"Shinji said you had a degree i…"  
"真嗣说你有学位……"

"I do but...it's a long story. Anyway I'll take this sample hopefully it'll give me the same results as the others."  
"是的，但……说来话长。总之，我会处理这个样本，希望它能得出与其他样本相同的结果。"

"What happened to the other samples?"  
"其他样本怎么了？"

"Stolen or went missing, on the Over The Rainbow there was an entire laboratory consisting of this stuff though. It was labeled as LCL in there, I took a sample but I gave it to Shinji when I surfaced on deck."  
"被盗或失踪，在《彩虹之上》号上有一个完全由这种物质组成的实验室。那里标着 LCL，我取了样本，但当我登上甲板时，我把它交给了真嗣。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"I knew I was going to end up in hospital and didn't want to risk it being stolen and I knew I could trust him with it. Of course now he's gone missing so I can't run any tests on it."  
"我知道我最终会进医院，不想冒险它被偷走，而且我知道我可以信任他保管它。当然，现在他失踪了，所以我无法对它进行任何测试。"

"I see, but why didn't you trust the hospitals?"  
"我明白了，但你为什么不信任医院呢？"

"I hate hospitals, it was in one where my mo…"  
"我讨厌医院，我的母亲就是在医院里……"

Misato looked on as Asuka stopped herself mid sentence, if Misato didn't know any better she could have sworn a look of sorrow appeared on Asuka's face, but it soon turned to anger.  
美里看着明日香话说到一半突然停住，如果不是了解她的话，美里几乎要以为她脸上闪过了一丝悲伤，但很快就被愤怒所取代。

"It doesn't matter, I just don't like hospitals and after Shinji's father appearing so coincidently in the last one I thought it'd be best to let him take care of it."  
"这无关紧要，我只是不喜欢医院，而且上次真嗣的父亲那么巧合地出现在那里，我觉得还是让他自己处理比较好。"

"I see, so what do we do now?"  
"我明白了，那我们现在该怎么办？"

"We get this sample back to a safe location, my house. Besides that, I don't know, maybe Shinji will have retur…."  
"我们得把这个样本带回一个安全的地方，我家里。除此之外，我也不清楚，也许真嗣会有办法……"

Asuka was cut off by the sound of her phone ringing, she pulled it out of her pocket and looked at the caller ID on the screen and looked in shock when she saw who it was.  
明日香的话被手机铃声打断，她从口袋里掏出手机，看到屏幕上的来电显示时，露出了震惊的表情。

'_Shinji Ikari'_ '碇真嗣'

She answered the phone and put it to her ear only to have the person hang up immediately. Just as Asuka was about to tell Misato what had happened the phone went again, only this time telling Asuka she had a text message, this too was from Shinji and only contained one word.  
她接起电话，放到耳边，却立刻被对方挂断。正当明日香准备告诉美里发生了什么时，电话再次响起，这次是短信提示，同样来自真嗣，只包含一个词。

'_Home'_ '家'

**Unknown Facility – 1500 hours  
未知设施 – 1500 时**

Kaji looked out across the car park from his spot under the entrance, he smiled when he saw the person stepping onto the tarmac and moving towards him. As he watched the man he threw his cigarette to the floor and stamped it out.  
碇站在入口下方的位置，眺望着停车场，当他看到那个人踏上柏油路面并向他走来时，他笑了。看着那人，他将香烟扔到地上，用脚踩灭。

"So we finally meet again, Shinji Ikari."  
“我们终于又见面了，碇真嗣。”

Shinji looked at him and moved into the facility as well.  
真嗣看了他一眼，也走进了设施。

"Agent Kaji…" "加治先生……"

"Please, just Kaji will do, it's been a while."  
"请直接叫我加治就好，已经有一段时间了。"

"That it has, what was the important thing you wanted to tell me about?"  
“确实如此，你之前想告诉我的重要事情是什么？”

"First of all there is something I want to know, why weren't you at Misato's last night or at work today?"  
"首先，我有件事想知道，为什么你昨晚不在美里那里，今天也没去上班？"

Shinji looked at him and then stared down at the floor, speaking quietly.  
真嗣看了看他，然后低头盯着地板，轻声说道。

"There was something I needed to think about, have you been watching me?"  
"有些事情我需要思考，你一直在观察我吗？"

"I've been assigned to Tokyo 3 and I heard from people that you had barely been seen. Misato will be worried about you."  
"我被派驻到第三新东京市，听说你几乎没露过面。美里会很担心你的。"

"I… It doesn't matter, there's nothing she can do, and anyway I need to sort this out on my own."  
“我……没关系，她什么也做不了，而且无论如何，我需要自己解决这件事。”

"That's where you're wrong Shinji, you need people you can trust and people who trust you."  
"你错了，真嗣，你需要的是那些你可以信赖的人，以及那些信赖你的人。"

Shinji looked up and began shouting.  
真嗣抬起头，开始大声喊道。

"And who trusts me? Misato only acts the way she does because she was my guardian, Sohryu thinks I'm an idiot and I don't know anything about Ayanami. I was even last to know about my father being who he was."  
"又有谁信任我呢？美里之所以那样做，只是因为她是我的监护人，丽认为我是个白痴，对绫波我一无所知。就连我父亲的真实身份，我也是最后一个才知道的。"

"Shinji I didn't want you to find out that way, that's why I asked you to come out here. I wanted to apologize for you finding out the way you did from Asuka, she always was a little blunt."  
"真嗣，我不希望你以那种方式得知真相，所以我才叫你出来。我想为你是从明日香那里得知这件事而道歉，她总是有点直来直去。"

"It's alright, if she didn't tell me like that no one would have, I just…why did he have to be there, why didn't he say anything to me?"  
"没关系，如果不是她那样告诉我，可能没人会说了，我只是……为什么他非得在场，为什么他不对我说些什么？"

"I don't know Shinji, but I do know something that might help you find out."  
"我不知道，真嗣，但我知道一些可能帮助你弄清楚的事情。"

"Is this the real reason you called me out here?"  
“这就是你叫我出来的真正原因吗？”

"Yes, there's a case you might be interested in."  
"是的，有个案件你可能会感兴趣。"

"So that's it huh? What's the case?"  
"原来如此，是什么案件？"

"Fifteen years ago two people, twins to be precise, went missing from their home on the outskirts of Tokyo. Their parents moved out of Tokyo on the day of the impact incident."  
"十五年前，一对双胞胎从东京郊外的家中失踪。他们的父母在事发当天离开了东京。"

"I see, what about it?"  
"我明白了，那又如何？"

"Well yesterday the twin girls returned to their home, their parent's new home. Not a scratch on them or anything and no memory of what had happened to them."  
"昨天那对双胞胎女孩回到了她们的新家，她们父母的新家。她们毫发无损，也没有任何关于发生过什么的记忆。"

"Unusual, but why would I be interested in it?"  
"虽然不寻常，但我为何会对这感兴趣呢？"

"Well a few reasons, on the day of the incident their parents reported seeing strange lights in the sky, second and probably the strangest the twins have not aged a day since the day they were abducted. They vanished at the age of nineteen and they both returned having not aged a day since then."  
"有几个原因，事发当天他们的父母报告说看到了天空中奇怪的光，其次，也是最奇怪的是，这对双胞胎自被绑架以来一天也没有老过。他们在十九岁时消失，回来时却和那时一样，一天也没有变老。"

"That's…" "那真是…"

"Impossible? Highly improbable? I know, but it's happened."  
"不可能？极不可能？我知道，但确实发生了。"

"Ok, so what's the third reason?"  
"好吧，那第三个原因是什么？"

"Their parents knew your father."  
"他们的父母认识你父亲。"

When Misato came too she was staring straight into two bright lights, she turned her head and found herself inside a hospital room. She attempted to lift herself up off of the bed but immediately went back down due to the immense pain around her back and stomach. As she propped herself into a sitting position a nurse entered the room and shot her a look of shock.  
当美里醒来时，她正直视着两个明亮的灯光，她转过头发现自己身处一间病房。她试图从床上坐起来，但立刻因背部和腹部的剧痛而躺了回去。当她撑起身体坐好时，一名护士走进房间，脸上露出震惊的表情。

"You're finally awake! We were afraid you'd never wake up."  
"你终于醒了！我们还担心你永远不会醒来了。"

Misato looked at her and spoke softly.  
美里看着她，轻声说道。

"Where… where am I?" "这…这是哪里？"

"It's alright, you're safe now."  
“没事了，你现在安全了。”

"What happened to me, how did I get here?"  
"我发生了什么，我是怎么来到这里的？"

"There was an incident in Tokyo, we found you on the outskirts and brought you to this medical facility."  
"东京发生了一起事件，我们在郊外发现了你，并把你带到了这家医疗机构。"

Misato felt pain at the back of her head as all the memories from that night ran through her mind at once, she felt herself freeze up as the nurse continued speaking.  
美里感到后脑勺一阵疼痛，那一夜的所有记忆瞬间涌入脑海，她感到自己僵住了，而护士还在继续说话。

"More will be explained later, it'd be best for you to just rest for now."  
"后续会有更多解释，你现在最好先休息。"

She was met with silence, the nurse made her way over to Misato and took a needle from the tray.  
她面对着沉默，护士走向美里，从托盘里取出一根针。

"You've been asleep for near enough three days now Miss Katsuragi, when you were recovered you were badly injured. This injection should help relieve some of the pain, the doctor will be in later to explain more."  
"你已经昏迷了近三天了，葛城小姐，你醒来时伤得很重。这个注射应该能缓解一些疼痛，医生稍后会来详细解释。"

Misato was still sat in silence as the nurse began to inject her with something. She looked down at the needle, still unable to speak, she could smell the stench of the liquid being injected into her.  
美里依旧沉默地坐着，护士开始给她注射某种药物。她低头看着针头，依旧无法言语，她能闻到被注入体内的液体散发出的恶臭。

'_It smells… like blood'_ '这味道……像是血'

A slight tingling sensation was felt in her arm and it quickly raced around her body, she felt her eyelids growing heavy as she sank into sleep once again.  
她的手臂感到一丝刺痛，这感觉迅速蔓延至全身，她感到眼皮愈发沉重，再次陷入沉睡。

**Asuka's Residence – 1830 hours  
明日香住所 – 18 时 30 分**

Asuka pulled her car into the driveway and looked across, just as she expected, Shinji was standing there on the doorstep looking at her. She got out the car and stormed over to him with a furious expression on her face.  
明日香将车驶入车道，目光一扫，不出所料，真嗣正站在门口望着她。她下车快步走向他，脸上带着怒气冲冲的表情。

"Agent Sohryu I…" "惣流特工，我……"

He was unable to get his sentence out before Asuka slapped him across the face, he brought his hand up to his face, feeling where she slapped him and looked down away from her.  
他还没能说完他的话，就被明日香一巴掌扇在了脸上，他抬起手摸了摸被她打过的地方，低头避开她的目光。

"I'm sorry for what happened…"  
"对于发生的事，我很抱歉……"

She slapped him again only this time she spoke afterwards.  
她再次扇了他一巴掌，只是这次之后她开口说话了。

"The first one was for Misato, the second one was for me. Now you may speak."  
“第一份是给美里小姐的，第二份是给我的。现在你可以说了。”

Asuka looked him directly in the eyes, noticing slight tears forming and a hint of sadness across his face. He reached his hand out towards her but he immediately brought it back and spoke, his voice breaking up.  
明日香直视着他的眼睛，注意到他眼角微微泛起的泪光和脸上的一丝哀伤。他伸出手想要触碰她，却又立刻缩了回去，开口时声音哽咽。

"Agent Sohryu… Asuka… I'm sorry I can't say anything more than that."  
“草薙特工……明日香……对不起，我只能说这么多。”

"Is that why you're here, to apologize?"  
“你来这里，就是为了道歉吗？”

"No… well yes I want to explain what happened but I…"  
"不…好吧，我是想解释发生了什么，但我…"

"Explain inside, despite what's happened I don't want you to die of pneumonia out here."  
"进去说吧，不管发生了什么，我可不想你在外面冻得得肺炎。"

"Thank you." “谢谢。”

Asuka frowned and unlocked the door and they both stepped inside into the house, she took her jacket off and hung it up. She stopped Shinji before he got any further into the entranceway.  
明日香皱了皱眉，解锁了门，两人一起走进屋内，她脱下外套挂了起来。她在真嗣进一步走进门厅前拦住了他。

"Give me your jacket, shirt and trousers."  
"把你的夹克、衬衫和裤子给我。"

"What, why?" "什么，为什么？"

"They're soaked through, idiot."  
"它们全湿透了，笨蛋。"

"But what will I wear then?"  
"但我要穿什么呢？"

"Well I've got a dress upstairs that'll suit you if you'd like that…."  
"嗯，楼上有一条裙子，如果你喜欢的话，应该适合你……"

"I don't think so, I'm fine."  
"我想不必了，我这样挺好。"

"See this bag here, they've got a change of clothes for you, Misato thought this might happen and had us stop off and pick them up from a store. What did you think I'd go out looking for you and stop to do some shopping for myself along the way?"  
"看这个包，里面有给你换的衣服，美里觉得可能会发生这种情况，让我们中途去商店买了一些。你以为我会出去找你，顺便给自己买点东西吗？"

"You were looking for me?"  
"你在找我？"

"Yes, Misato was worried about you, I personally didn't care. Now hurry up and get changed."  
"是的，美里担心你，我个人倒是不在乎。快点换衣服吧。"

"Here?" "这里吗？"

"No, on the moon, of course here. I'm not letting you get all that water in my house."  
"不，当然是在月球上，这里。我可不想让你把那么多水弄到我家里来。"

"But… but...oh alright then."  
"但是…但是…哦，好吧。"

"Good, I'll go make you a coffee and then you can tell me why you decided to be an idiot."  
"好，我去给你冲杯咖啡，然后你再告诉我为什么决定当个傻瓜。"

Shinji began to unbutton his shirt as Asuka turned towards the kitchen, a slight grin on her face. She paused when he heard him calling her.  
真嗣开始解开衬衫的扣子，而明日香转身走向厨房，脸上带着一丝微笑。当她听到他叫她时，她停了下来。

"Asuka… thank you." "明日香……谢谢你。"

"What for?" "为什么？"

"For… never mind." "为了……算了，没什么。"

Shinji quickly changed out of his clothes and put on the new set Misato had gotten him, a few moments later he went into the kitchen to find Asuka pouring two cups of coffee and putting them on the side. She turned and looked at the clothes she had picked out for him, of course she wasn't going to tell him that. It was nothing too grand but it made a change from the same black trousers and white shirt he always wore. She pointed him towards the main room and she took a seat, she watched Shinji as he nervously looked around.  
真嗣迅速换下衣服，穿上美里为他准备的新衣服，片刻后他走进厨房，发现明日香正在倒两杯咖啡并放在一旁。她转过身，看着她为他挑选的衣服，当然她不会告诉他这一点。这并不是什么特别华丽的装扮，但总算让他摆脱了总是穿的那条黑色裤子和白衬衫。她示意他去客厅，自己则坐了下来，她观察着真嗣紧张地四处张望。

"You can sit down you know, the furniture isn't going to eat you."  
“你可以坐下的，你知道，家具不会吃了你。”

He smiled and took a seat, as soon as he did so Asuka began speaking.  
他笑了笑，坐了下来，他一坐下，明日香就开始说话。

"So where did you run off to?"  
"那你跑哪儿去了？"

"I just had some things I needed to think about, it was about my father."  
"我有些事情需要思考，是关于我父亲的。"

Asuka looked down embarrassed slightly.  
明日香略显尴尬地低下头。

"Oh."

"Thanks for telling me, if you hadn't I don't think I would have gotten to know."  
“谢谢你告诉我，如果不是你，我想我可能永远不会知道。”

"Well that's what I'm there for, you're the one who looks for the outlandish explanations and I'm the one who puts it bluntly."  
“这就是我的作用，你总是寻找那些离奇的解释，而我则是直截了当地说出来。”

He laughed and took a drink from his coffee as she continued.  
他笑着喝了一口咖啡，她继续说着。

"So why did you come here, of all the places I didn't expect you to end up here?"  
“那么，为什么你会来这里，我完全没想到你会出现在这个地方？”

"I can't face Misato yet, I need a bit more time and besides I wanted to return something to you."  
“我还不能面对美里，我需要更多时间，而且我想把某样东西还给你。”

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"The vial you gave me, it's in my jacket pocket still, I thought you might want it back to analyze or something."  
"你给我的那个小瓶子，还在我夹克口袋里，我想你可能需要拿回去分析什么的。"

"Oh right." "哦，对。"

"I also met up with Kaji today, he contacted me. He gave me information on a new case, he also said it might help me find out more about my father."  
"今天我还和加治碰面了，是他联系我的。他给了我一个新案件的信息，还说这可能有助于我了解更多关于我父亲的事情。"

Asuka glanced at him and sighed.  
明日香瞥了他一眼，叹了口气。

"Is that really why you're here?"  
“你来这里真的是因为这个原因吗？”

Shinji sat back in the chair looking dejected, what he had said didn't quite come out how he had hoped it to.  
真嗣沮丧地靠在椅背上，他刚才说的话并没有完全表达出他希望的意思。

"No, I… sorry." “不，我……对不起。”

"Three." “三。”

"What?" "什么？"

"That's three times you've apologized to me in the space of ten minutes."  
"十分钟内你已经向我道歉三次了。"

"Sorry…" "对不起…"

"You did that on purpose."  
"你是故意的。"

"I know." "我知道。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Why what?" "为什么这样问？"

"Why do you want to find out about him?"  
"你为什么想知道他的事？"

"He abandoned me with my uncle two years after my mother vanished, I want to find out why, I want to find out why he was there in that place and why he couldn't even say anything to me. I want to tell him… never mind."  
"他在我母亲消失两年后就把我丢给了叔叔，我想知道为什么，我想知道他为什么会在那个地方，为什么连一句话都不跟我说。我想告诉他……算了。"

"Do you hate him?" "你恨他吗？"

Shinji looked around the room and nodded slightly, Asuka moved over to his seat and nervously put an arm around him. She smiled at him and changed the subject.  
真嗣环顾房间，微微点头，明日香走到他的座位旁，紧张地搂住他。她朝他微笑，并转换了话题。

"Well, seeing as you've got a new case, and I owe you one for upsetting you I guess this means I'll have to go back to work."  
"好吧，既然你有了新案子，而我欠你一个人情，看来我得回去工作了。"

"You don't have to rush back and besides, you didn't upset me I just…."  
"你不必急着回来，而且，你并没有让我不高兴，我只是……"

Asuka ginned and quickly interrupted him off.  
明日香咧嘴一笑，迅速打断了他。

"I know, but I want to get back to work, my talents go to waste sitting around at home besides, I can't imagine you'd get anywhere without me."  
“我知道，但我想要回去工作，我的才能在家闲坐是浪费，再说了，没有我，你恐怕也走不远。”

Shinji smiled and turned slightly red, he looked away, hoping Asuka wouldn't notice and spoke quietly.  
真嗣微笑着，脸上微微泛红，他转过头去，希望明日香没有注意到，然后轻声说道。

"Thanks." "谢谢。"

### Chapter 10 The Morning After

_17th May 2015 2015 年 5 月 17 日_

**Asuka's Residence – 0930 hours  
明日香的家 – 上午 0930 时**

An unfamiliar ceiling, that was the first thing Shinji thought of when he slowly opened his eyes. Blinking twice, he looked straight up, noticing something else that was strange about this ceiling, it appeared to be spinning, or was it him who was spinning? He brought his hand up towards his head and rubbed it slightly as a sharp pain ran across it.  
陌生的天花板，这是真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛时的第一个念头。他眨了眨眼，直视上方，注意到这个天花板有些奇怪，它似乎在旋转，还是说其实是他在旋转？他抬起手，轻轻揉了揉头部，一阵尖锐的疼痛随之袭来。

'_Oh god, I feel terrible'_  
'哦天哪，我感觉糟透了'

He closed his eyes as the rest of the side effects began to hit him, his head began to pound slightly more and his mouth was incredibly dry. Slowly he turned his head only to feel his stomach churning, he resisted the urge to throw up all other the carpet and sat up slowly groaning slightly.  
他闭上眼睛，随着其他副作用开始袭来，他的头开始更剧烈地疼痛，嘴巴也异常干燥。他慢慢地转过头，只感到胃里一阵翻腾，他强忍着不把东西吐得满地毯都是，缓缓坐起身，发出轻微的呻吟。

'_This isn't good, what the hell happened?'_  
'这可不妙，到底发生了什么？'

He jumped as there was a loud thud from upstairs, this only served to make his headache worse. Shinji slowly began to rub the sides of his head and breathed slowly, trying to ease his stomach. There was another thud followed by a loud shout of pain, once again Shinji jumped at the sound. He looked around the living room he was in, trying to remember what happened and finally realizing where he was.  
他猛地一跳，因为楼上突然传来一声巨响，这只会让他的头痛更加剧烈。真嗣缓缓地开始揉搓太阳穴两侧，慢慢呼吸，试图缓解胃部的不适。紧接着又是一声巨响，伴随着一声痛苦的喊叫，真嗣再次被这声音吓了一跳。他环顾自己所在的客厅，试图回忆发生了什么，最终意识到自己在哪里。

'_Oh yeah… I'm at Asuka's, but what happened?'_  
'哦对了……我在明日香家，但到底发生了什么？'

There were more noises as he heard someone making their way down the stairs, albeit slowly. He groggily turned his head towards the door as it opened slowly, he watched as Asuka slowly made her way into the living room wearing pajamas and a dressing gown, she too looked incredibly pale and was holding her head. Shinji tried to open his mouth to speak but thought better of it as a wave of nausea swept over him again. Instead he merely nodded towards her. She motioned back at him and made her way over to one of the other seats in the living room, she threw herself down on it, moaning slightly.  
随着楼梯上传来更多声响，有人正缓慢地走下来。他昏昏沉沉地转头望向门口，门缓缓打开，他看到明日香穿着睡衣和晨衣，慢慢地走进客厅，她的脸色也异常苍白，手捂着头。真嗣试图张嘴说话，但一阵恶心感再次袭来，他明智地选择了沉默，只是向她点了点头。她回应了他的动作，走向客厅的另一张椅子，猛地坐下，轻轻呻吟了一声。

"Never again… I don't care what anyone say's, never ever again."  
"再也不……我不在乎别人怎么说，再也不了。"

Shinji swallowed hard and opened his mouth to speak.  
真嗣艰难地咽了咽口水，张开嘴准备说话。

"What happened last night?"  
"昨晚发生了什么？"

Asuka gave a muffled reply from where she was lying.  
明日香从她躺着的地方发出了一声闷闷的回答。

"You mean you don't remember? Some idiot here had the great idea to start drinking last night."  
“你是说你不记得了？昨晚这里有个傻瓜提议开始喝酒。”

Shinji leaned back on the sofa and closed his eyes, trying to remember. He knew he had met Kaji then went to Asuka's where she slapped him twice for what he done. Then he was invited into her house they talked for a bit and then…  
真嗣靠在沙发上，闭上眼睛，试图回忆。他记得自己遇到了加持，然后去了明日香那里，她因为他做的事扇了他两巴掌。然后他被邀请进她的房子，他们聊了一会儿，然后……

He came to a realization and replied, his voice slightly rose, which didn't help his head one bit.  
他突然意识到这一点，回答时声音略微提高，这对他的头疼毫无帮助。

"It was your idea to start drinking, you thought it'd make me feel better."  
“是你提议开始喝酒的，你以为这会让我感觉好些。”

"Yes I know, please don't remind me… and stop shouting, my head feels like it's been ran over."  
“是的，我知道，请别再提醒我了……而且别再喊了，我的头感觉像被碾过一样。”

"Sorry." "对不起。"

Shinji lay back down and threw the cover over his head, shutting his eyes as the room fell into silence. The memories of last night coming back to him, he remembers the first drink and then the second and then maybe one more, everything after that was a blur. Shinji was never much of a drinker.  
真嗣重新躺下，把被子拉过头，闭上眼睛，房间陷入寂静。昨晚的记忆涌回脑海，他记得第一杯酒，然后是第二杯，或许还有一杯，之后的一切都模糊不清。真嗣向来不怎么喝酒。

"Oh shit." “该死。”

Shinji spoke out from beneath the covers.  
真嗣在被窝里出声道。

"What?" "什么？"

"It's half nine, we're late. Misato is going to kill us."  
"已经九点半了，我们迟到了。美里会杀了我们的。"

Shinji threw the covers off of him and opened his eyes.  
真嗣掀开被子，睁开了眼睛。

"Crap…" "糟糕……"

Shinji looked over at where Asuka was, she was still lying face down on the sofa. He reached round, his head still swimming, and quickly pulled on the shirt and trousers he had been given. His stomach churned as he stood up, causing him to sit back down for a second.  
真嗣朝明日香所在的地方望去，她依旧面朝下躺在沙发上。他摸索着穿上别人给他的衬衫和裤子，脑袋还晕乎乎的。他站起来时胃里一阵翻腾，不得不又坐了回去。

"There's no time for breakfast, we can get something at lunch if you want, and I'll pay."  
“没时间吃早餐了，如果你想的话，我们可以在午餐时吃点什么，我请客。”

Thinking about food was something Shinji immediately regretted, not only because of the effect it had on his body but also because of the look Asuka gave him.  
想到食物，真嗣立刻后悔了，不仅因为这影响到了他的身体，还因为明日香看他的眼神。

"If you mention food again I'll kill you."  
“你要是再提吃的，我就宰了你。”

"Sorry." "对不起。"

"Shut up, let's just go."  
“闭嘴，我们走吧。”

She stood up and steadily made her way into the kitchen and poured herself a small glass of water. Shinji followed her into the kitchen and did the same, the water hit his mouth easing some of the dryness but not helping his stomach much. Asuka stood over the sink, her head bowed slightly as she sipped from the glass, resisting the urge to immediately throw up whenever she took a drink. She threw the rest of the contents into the sink and turned to Shinji.  
她站起身，稳稳地走向厨房，为自己倒了一小杯水。真嗣跟着她进了厨房，也照做了，水润过他的嘴唇，缓解了一些干燥，但对他的胃却没多大帮助。明日香站在水槽前，头微微低垂，小口啜饮着玻璃杯中的水，强忍着每次喝水时立刻呕吐的冲动。她将剩下的水倒进水槽，转身面对真嗣。

"Come on, let's go." “走吧，我们出发。”

Shinji nodded as they made their way out of house, Asuka stopped to get her car keys and put her shoes on. They stepped out of the house and walked over to the car, however Shinji halted Asuka before they got in.  
真嗣点头，他们一起走出家门，明日香停下来拿车钥匙并穿上鞋子。他们走出房子，走向汽车，但就在上车前，真嗣叫住了明日香。

"Asuka, should you really be going to work like that?"  
"明日香，你真的要这样去上班吗？"

She looked down noticing she still had on her pajamas and dressing gown, looking up she glared a hole through Shinji.  
她低头注意到自己还穿着睡衣和晨袍，抬头时狠狠地瞪了真嗣一眼。

"You idiot, why didn't you tell me before I stepped outside the house?"  
"你这个白痴，为什么不在我出门前告诉我？"

"Sorry." "对不起。"

"I should make you walk for this, give me five minutes."  
"我该让你走回去的，给我五分钟。"

She threw the car keys at Shinji and stormed back into the house, slamming the door behind her. Shinji laughed quietly to himself as he opened the car door and stepped inside, ready for what was going to be a very long day.  
她把车钥匙扔给真嗣，怒气冲冲地回到屋里，砰的一声关上门。真嗣暗自轻笑，打开车门坐了进去，准备迎接这漫长的一天。

**NERV Offices – 1000 hours  
NERV 总部办公室 —— 上午十点  
**Misato wandered into the office, a furious look on her face, she jumped when she saw Rei sitting at one of the desks in the room, typing something into the computer. She wandered over to Rei's desk and looked at the Blue Haired girl curiously. Rei turned and looked up, her cold red eyes staring directly at her.  
美里怒气冲冲地走进办公室，当她看到丽坐在房间的一张桌子前，对着电脑打字时，她吓了一跳。她好奇地走到丽的桌前，看着这位蓝发女孩。丽转过头来，抬起头，她那双冰冷的红色眼睛直直地盯着她。

"Agent Katsuragi, is there something you wanted?"  
“葛城上尉，您有什么事吗？”

"Well actually yes, I was just wondering where the hell agents Sohryu and Ikari were today."  
"实际上是的，我刚才还在想，今天两位特工草薙和碇到底去哪儿了。"

"I have not seen them."  
"我没见到他们。"

They both turned just as the door to the office opened again, Misato glared as both Shinji and Asuka made their way into the room looking pale and moving slowly. A wave of anger flashed through her as she realized just what was wrong with them and waited until they had both sat down to speak, her voice serious.  
他们俩刚转过身，办公室的门再次打开，美里瞪着眼睛，看着真嗣和明日香脸色苍白、动作缓慢地走进房间。她立刻意识到他们出了什么问题，等到两人都坐下后，她才严肃地开口说话。

"Well I'm glad you have both finally shown up, where have you been?"  
“我很高兴你们俩终于出现了，之前去哪儿了？”

Shinji looked up and spoke quietly.  
真嗣抬起头，轻声说道。

"Sorry, we were held up by something."  
“抱歉，我们被一些事情耽搁了。”

"I can see that, what is wrong with you both, as if I can't already guess?"  
“我看得出来，你们俩怎么了，好像我猜不到似的？”

Asuka switched on her computer screen and recoiled back from the sudden flash of light on it. She rubbed her eyes and muttered.  
明日香打开电脑屏幕，被突然的闪光吓得往后一缩。她揉了揉眼睛，低声嘀咕。

"There's nothing wrong with us, we're just tired."  
“我们没事，只是累了。”

Rei looked on at the two pilots as they spoke to her, knowing exactly what was wrong with her fellow agent's. It was a concept she found hard to understand, the idea of drinking so much alcohol it made you ill the next day, if it made people feel unpleasant then why would they do it? She turned back to her screen as Misato continued berating the two Agents.  
丽看着两位驾驶员向她说话，心中清楚她的同事们出了什么问题。她难以理解那种喝得酩酊大醉以至于第二天生病的感觉，如果酒精让人感觉不适，那为什么还要这么做呢？她转回屏幕，继续听着美里训斥两位特工。

"Tired, yes you both look it. Dry throat, spinning ceilings and a bad headache is often signs of tiredness. Don't talk to me like I'm stupid, what you do in your own time is up to you but you're both NERV Agents, you have an example to set. If you are going to do something like this next time, don't even bother coming in."  
“累了吧，你们俩看起来确实如此。干涩的喉咙、旋转的天花板和剧烈的头痛通常是疲劳的迹象。别把我当傻子，你们私下的行为我管不着，但你们都是 NERV 的特工，得树立榜样。下次再这样，干脆别来了。”

They both spoke from behind their desks in unison.  
他们俩异口同声地从各自的办公桌后说道。

"Yes Misato." “是的，美里小姐。”

Misato frowned and looked at them both as they sat with their heads on their desk. A wicked smile crept across her face as she found out just the way to punish them, first some light teasing then the final blow.  
美里皱着眉头，看着他们俩把头靠在桌子上。当她想到了惩罚他们的方法时，一个邪恶的微笑慢慢爬上了她的脸庞，先是轻轻的嘲弄，然后是最后的重击。

'_There's nothing I can do to punish them, I can't take this to the director but I can still have some fun.'_  
“我没有什么可以惩罚他们的办法，我不能把这事报告给导演，但我还是可以找点乐子。”

"So what were you two celebrating in order to get so drunk last night, were you really that happy about Shinji returning safely?"  
"昨晚你们俩喝得那么醉，是在庆祝什么？真就那么高兴真嗣平安回来吗？"

Asuka lifted her head up off the desk and stared over at Misato, a slight hint of redness burning onto her face.  
明日香从桌上抬起头，望向美里，脸上微微泛起红晕。

"No, we just decided to have a drink, nothing more."  
"不，我们只是决定喝一杯，没别的。"

She put her head down again as the wicked smile turned into a fully fledged grin.  
她再次低下头，那邪恶的微笑转变成一个完全绽放的笑容。

"So you're sure you didn't do anything you'd both regret, well maybe you'd had enjoyed it. You know some people don't have control of themselves when they're drunk, who knows what you both done."  
“所以你确定你们没做任何事后会后悔的事，嗯，或许你们当时还挺享受的。你知道有些人喝醉后就控制不住自己，谁知道你们俩干了些什么。”

Now it was Shinji's turn to quickly raise his head and get embarrassed.  
现在轮到真嗣迅速抬起头，脸红了起来。

"Misato we… we did n-nothing like that, if you must know I slept on the sofa downstairs and Agent Sohryu slept upstairs."  
“美里，我们……我们没做那种事，如果你非要知道的话，我在楼下的沙发上睡的，惣流小姐睡在楼上。”

"Oh, so you did stay at hers then?"  
“哦，所以你确实在她那儿过夜了？”

He nodded slightly. 他微微点头。

"Y-Yes…" “嗯-嗯…”

"Excellent." “太好了。”

Asuka quickly shouted back...  
“明日香迅速回喊道...”

"Just what is that supposed to mean?"  
“那到底是什么意思？”

"Nothing at all, now who's hungry, I could take you all out for some breakfast."  
“一点意思也没有，现在谁饿了，我可以带你们去吃早餐。”

Asuka and Shinji groaned and put their heads down on the desk, Shinji muttering slightly.  
明日香和真嗣呻吟着把头埋在桌上，真嗣小声嘀咕着。

"Please don't mention food."  
“请别提食物。”

"Oh now come on, I sure could go for something fried right about now, something like…"  
“哦，拜托，我现在真想来点炸的东西，比如……”

Asuka groaned. 明日香呻吟了一声。

"I think I'm going to be sick."  
“我觉得我要吐了。”

"Don't be like that, maybe something fried and greasy."  
“别这样，或许来点炸的和油腻的会好些。”

Shinji spoke again. 真嗣再次开口。

"No really Misato, stop, I really am about to be sick."  
“真的，美里，别这样，我真的快吐了。”

"You'll feel better after this, I know a place that does the greasiest bacon sandwiches, just what you need after…"  
“这之后你会感觉好些的，我知道一家店做的培根三明治特别油腻，正是你……之后需要的。”

"Oh God." "哦，天哪。"

Both Shinji and Asuka leapt up from their desks and ran out of the room their hands clamped over their mouths. Misato couldn't help but laugh at their suffering as she made her way over to Rei again.  
真嗣和明日香同时从桌边跳起，双手捂嘴冲出了房间。美里看着他们痛苦的模样，忍不住笑了起来，再次走向丽。

'_Can't hold their alcohol, oh well.'_  
'酒量不行啊，算了。'

Rei turned and looked at Misato again, trying to figure out why Misato found the events that had transpired so funny.  
丽转身再次看向美里，试图弄明白为什么美里会觉得发生的事情如此好笑。

"Agent Katsuragi, why do you find their situation so amusing?"  
“葛城美里特工，你为何觉得他们的情况如此好笑？”

"Oh that's easy, Asuka and Shinji brought this on themselves. Maybe it's a bit cruel but how else am I going to punish them?"  
“哦，那很简单，明日香和真嗣这是自作自受。或许有点残忍，但除此之外我还能怎么惩罚他们呢？”

"Can you not submit a report to the Director or suspend them?"  
"你不能向局长提交报告或者暂停他们的职务吗？"

"I could but coming in with a hangover isn't really bad enough for that sort of thing, besides I need my best agents here and not at home. No, they inflicted it on themselves and besides, they'll be better once they've got it out of their system."  
"我可以，但宿醉上班其实还没严重到那种程度，而且我需要我最好的特工在这里而不是在家。不，他们这是自作自受，而且等他们把这股劲儿缓过去，就会好起来的。"

"I see." “我明白了。”

Rei turned back to her computer just as Shinji and Asuka reentered the room, holding their stomachs still. She felt her lips curl upwards into a smile as she caught a glimpse of their faces. Shinji had now broken into a sweat and was breathing deeply, he reentered the room, glaring daggers into Misato. Asuka soon followed him, also glaring at Misato, her hair sticking to her face. Rei smiled and turned back to the computer just as she saw Asuka turn to look at her. Before Asuka was able to say anything Misato quickly cut her off.  
丽转回电脑前，恰逢真嗣和明日香再次进入房间，两人手捂腹部。她瞥见他们的面容，嘴角不由上扬。真嗣已是满头大汗，呼吸沉重，他回到房间，目光如刀般射向美里。明日香紧随其后，同样怒视美里，发丝贴在脸上。丽微笑着转回电脑，就在这时，她看到明日香转向她。明日香还未及开口，美里便迅速打断了她。

"Ok, well I've got paperwork to do, so I'll leave you to work, although I want to speak to you Shinji."  
“好吧，我还有文书工作要做，所以不打扰你工作了，不过我确实想和你谈谈，真嗣。”

Shinji looked up from his desk at Misato, the grin on her face had gone and had been replaced with a concerned look. He looked downwards shamefully as he caught Asuka looking at him as well. The memories of the previous day came back to him as he remembered how Asuka reacted when she got back to her home and how she told him Misato was concerned.  
真嗣从桌前抬起头，望向美里，她脸上的笑容已经消失，取而代之的是担忧的神情。他羞愧地低下头，注意到明日香也在看着他。昨天的记忆涌上心头，他想起了明日香回到家时的反应，以及她告诉他自己美里很担心。

"I understand." "我明白了。"

**Directors Office – 1100 hours  
局长办公室 – 11 点整**

Kaji stepped forward towards the lone desk in the low lit room, below him the carpet was adorned with a white symbol he didn't recognize. A smile spread across his face as he saw the director looking on at him, his hands folded neatly in front of his face, the lone ceiling light reflecting in the man's glasses.  
加持向前迈步，走向昏暗房间中唯一的一张桌子，脚下地毯上装饰着一个他不认识的白色符号。当他看到局长正注视着他，双手整齐地叠放在脸前，头顶唯一的灯光在对方的镜片上反射时，他的脸上露出了笑容。

"I love what you've done with the place, Ikari."  
“我喜欢你对这个地方的布置，碇。”

He produced a vial of orange liquid from his pocket and held it up to the light, studying it carefully. The liquid inside gave off a faint glow, Kaji wasn't sure if it was the liquid or the lighting in the room.  
他从口袋里掏出一瓶橙色液体，举到灯光下仔细端详。瓶内的液体散发出微弱的光芒，Kaji 不确定这是液体本身的光泽还是房间灯光的效果。

"You know if the committee knew I took this and gave it to you they'd not only kill me, they'd kill you and the two agents you've injected with the Serum."  
“你知道如果委员会知道我拿了这瓶药给你，他们不仅会杀了我，还会杀了你和那两个被你注射了血清的特工。”

"The committee has other concerns than finding one lost vial, they have the rest of the angels to track and of course the human instrumentality project. Keel and the rest won't miss it."  
“委员会有其他更重要的关注点，他们要追踪剩下的天使，当然还有人类补完计划。Keel 和其他人不会在意这一瓶遗失的药剂。”

"That's true, but this vial doesn't contain the same serum that was in the rest of the vials in that laboratory, this one contains something slightly more special.  
确实如此，但这支试管里的血清与实验室其他试管中的并不相同，这里面装着的是某种略显特别的东西。

Gendo smiled and picked the vial up, examining it through the light, he turned back to see Agent Kaji looking at him, expecting some sort of explanation.  
源渡微笑着拿起试管，透过光线仔细观察，他转过身来，看到加持良治特工正看着他，期待着某种解释。

"Correct, this is not the Evangelion Serum that we have used on the two Agents, this is one of the main ingredients for the serum of course, heavily unmodified. This vial contains DNA of SEELE's first specimen, the DNA of Adam."  
“没错，这不是我们用在两位特工身上的 EVA 血清，当然，这是血清的主要成分之一，未经大幅修改。这支试管中包含了 SEELE 的第一号样本，亚当的 DNA。”

"Very impressive, now I wonder why you would need such a thing."  
“非常令人印象深刻，现在我好奇你为何需要这样的东西。”

"My plans are none of your concern, you were just to collect this from the ship and deliver it to me as agreed. You will find your payment in your office."  
“我的计划与你无关，你只需按约定从船上取来此物交给我。报酬自会在你办公室里找到。”

"Yes sir." “是的，先生。”

Kaji nodded and began to exit the office, he was just about to reach the door when Gendo stopped him.  
加持点点头，开始离开办公室，就在他快要走到门口时，源度叫住了他。

"And Agent Kaji, it would be wise for you not to tell my son or Agent Sohryu anymore about me, that includes my role at this organization, am I understood?"  
“还有，加持特工，最好不要再向我儿子或惣流特工透露更多关于我的信息，包括我在组织中的角色，明白了吗？”

Kaji grinned as he walked out the door.  
加治笑着走出门去。

"I understand." “我明白了。”

Kaji exited the room, closing the door behind him only to come face to face with Misato, acting quickly he grabbed hold of her and spun her round. Looking into her eyes and grinning at her.  
加持走出房间，关上门后，却迎面碰上了美里。他迅速抓住她，将她转了个圈。凝视着她的眼睛，向她咧嘴一笑。

"Fancy us meeting like this."  
“真巧啊，我们这样相遇。”

Misato shot him a look of disgust and quickly shoved him away.  
美里厌恶地瞪了他一眼，迅速将他推开。

"Oh god it's you, what the hell are you doing here?"  
"哦天哪，是你，你到底在这里干什么？"

"Well I was just in the neighborhood and thought I'd nip in and see how you were."  
"嗯，我正好在附近，想着顺便进来瞧瞧你怎么样。"

"Well I'm fine, and busy, so leave me alone."  
"我挺好的，也很忙，所以别烦我。"

"Oh now don't be like that, we have a lot of catching up to do, maybe you'd like to see my office."  
"哦，别这样嘛，我们有很多要聊的，或许你想参观一下我的办公室？"

"Pervert… wait a minute, your office, you work here!?"  
"变态……等等，你的办公室，你在这里工作！？"

"Just got transferred in today, we'll be seeing a lot of each other in the future."  
"今天刚调过来，以后我们会经常见面的。"

"Not if I can help it."  
“只要我能阻止。”

"You're still as cute as ever you know."  
“你还是一如既往地可爱，你知道吗？”

"And you're still as pathetic and immature as ever."  
“而你还是一如既往地可怜又幼稚。”

Misato turned towards the elevator, Kaji grinned and followed her inside, she sighed and pressed the button to go down to the basement level as he simply stood there grinning.  
美里转向电梯，加持笑着跟了进去，她叹了口气，按下按钮前往地下室，而他只是站在那里，依旧咧嘴笑着。

"What do you think you're doing?"  
“你以为你在做什么？”

"I'm going to my office."  
我要去办公室。

"Is this some sort of joke?"  
“这是某种玩笑吗？”

"Would I lie to you?"  
“我会骗你吗？”

"Do you want me to answer that question?"  
“你想让我回答这个问题吗？”

Misato was about to halt the elevator and storm out just to get away from the man when she remembered what had happened a few days ago. Their eyes met as she spoke.  
美里正准备停下电梯，冲出去只是为了逃离那个男人，这时她想起了几天前发生的事情。当她说话时，他们的目光相遇了。

"How did you know about Shinji's father?"  
“你怎么知道真嗣的父亲是谁？”

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

"Gendo Rokubungi… how did you know that was Shinji's father?"  
“源堂·碇……你怎么知道那是真嗣的父亲？”

Kaji frowned, the smile from his face had gone as he tried to work out how to answer Misato. He couldn't tell her the truth, she wasn't ready for it, but if he couldn't lie to her, knowing what she had been through in the past, she had a right to know parts of it.  
加持皱起眉头，脸上的笑容消失了，他努力思索着如何回答美里。他不能告诉她真相，她还没准备好接受，但如果不能对她撒谎，考虑到她过去的经历，她有权知道其中的一部分。

"It comes from when I was in Germany, the girl I looked after, Asuka Langley Sohryu, her mother was friends with Yui Ikari. I later found out she was married to someone called Gendo Ikari, or as he used to be called, Rokubungi."  
“这源于我在德国时照顾的一个女孩，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，她的母亲与碇唯是朋友。后来我得知，碇唯嫁给了一个人，名叫碇源堂，或者他以前被称为六分仪。”

It wasn't the most convincing of explanations, but in his mind it would do for now, he glanced over at Misato as the elevator came to a halt. He could immediately tell what she was thinking, it had been ten years since they had last seen each other but it felt like it was only yesterday. Their eyes met again as she nodded her head slightly, acknowledging the explanation "  
这个解释并不十分令人信服，但在他看来，眼下足够了。电梯停下时，他瞥了一眼美里。他立刻明白她在想什么，虽然他们已经十年未见，但感觉就像昨天才分开一样。两人的目光再次相遇，她微微点头，认可了这个解释。

**Shinji/Asuka's Office – 1115 hours  
真嗣/明日香的办公室 – 上午 11 点 15 分**

Shinji turned his head away from the screen down towards the documents on his desk, they had still been unopened since he had received them from Kaji the previous day. He looked around the room realizing he was the only person in there, Asuka was talking to Misato in her office about making an early return to active duty since the Over The Rainbow incident, and as for Ayanami, well even when she was there it was as if she wasn't.  
真嗣将视线从屏幕上移开，转向桌上的文件，这些文件自前一天从加持那里收到后还未曾拆封。他环顾四周，意识到房间里只有他一人。明日香正在办公室与美里讨论提前重返现役的事宜，毕竟经历了“彩虹之上”事件；至于绫波，即便她在场，也仿佛不存在一般。

A strange thought possessed him as he looked over at Ayanami's desk, his eyes scanning the bare surface. He slowly stood up and made his way over towards the desk and began looking around. Her workstation was still on but was locked, instead he slowly opened up one of the drawers. He wasn't sure why he had this urge to check through her stuff but nonetheless there he was. Maybe it was a trust issue, until the Ramiel incident the only time he had seen her was when she was present when he was being attacked by Sachiel and again when he fell ill a few weeks later. Asuka on the other hand, claimed to have been attacked by her.  
当他目光扫过绫波的桌面，那空无一物的表面时，一种奇异的想法攫住了他。他缓缓站起身，走向那张桌子，开始四处打量。她的工作站仍在运行，但已锁定，于是他慢慢拉开其中一个抽屉。他不确定为何会有翻看她物品的冲动，但他就站在那里。或许这是信任问题，在雷米尔事件之前，他唯一一次见到她是在萨基尔袭击他时，以及几周后他生病时。而另一方面，明日香声称自己曾被她攻击过。

There was something else there that drove him to look, it was when he thought back to their first proper meeting when, Shinji mentioned the name Gendo Rokubungi, his fathers name, he saw something flash in Ayanami's eyes and just now he had figured out what it was, recognition. She had recognized the name, she knew who he was. He rummaged through the drawer, hoping that she wouldn't return while he was searching. That was when he found it, a small piece of card in the drawer with a photo of a man and what Shinji assumed was a younger Rei Ayanami on it.  
那里还有其他东西驱使他去查看，那是在他回想起他们第一次正式见面时，当真嗣提到名字 Gendo Rokubungi，他父亲的名字，他看到绫波眼中闪过一丝光芒，就在刚才他才明白那是什么，是认出。她认出了那个名字，她知道他是谁。他在抽屉里翻找，希望她不会在他搜索时回来。就在那时，他找到了它，抽屉里有一张小卡片，上面有一张男人的照片，以及真嗣猜测是年轻时的绫波零的照片。

'_That's him, she does know him but how? Why would my father be in a picture with Agent Ayanami?'_  
那是他，她的确认识他，但怎么认识的？为什么我父亲会和绫波零特工会在一起的照片里？

"What are you doing?" “你在做什么？”

He felt a sense of dread as he heard the words being spoken, this was just what he didn't want to happen. Shinji clutched hold of the photo and looked up slowly only, to be met with the red eyes of Agent Ayanami, he swallowed hard as he stumbled backwards and away from the desk. She looked down at the photo he was clutching and immediately went to grab it, this was the first time Shinji had noticed the girl showing emotion, anger flashed across her face as she tried to grab the photo out of his hand.  
听到这些话，他感到一阵恐惧，这正是他最不想发生的事。真嗣紧紧抓住那张照片，缓缓抬头，迎上了绫波零特工那双红色的眼睛，他艰难地咽了口唾沫，踉跄后退，远离了桌子。她低头看着他紧握的照片，立刻伸手去抢，这是真嗣第一次注意到女孩流露出情感，愤怒在她脸上闪过，她试图从他手中夺走照片。

"Agent Ayanami calm down, I can explain."  
“绫波零特工，冷静点，我可以解释。”

The words did nothing to stop the girl as she still continued to try and grab the photo away from him. For some reason Shinji's mind wouldn't allow him to let go as he struggled to hold on, wanting to try to get some answers from her.  
这些话并未让女孩停下，她依然继续试图从他手中夺走照片。不知为何，真嗣的内心不允许他放手，他挣扎着坚持，想要从她那里得到一些答案。

"Wait, what do you know about him?"  
"等等，你对他的了解有多少？"

Still no effect as she pulled the photo away from him and held onto it tightly, placing it back onto her desk.  
她依然无动于衷，将照片从他手中抽离，紧紧握住，然后放回桌上。

"Ayanami…do you know him?"  
"绫波…你认识他吗？"

Silence befell them both as he awaited her response, his heart racing and his mind focused on one thing. After what seemed like an eternity the answer came, Rei spoke much more softly then she had before, it was almost sorrowful.  
沉默笼罩着他们，他等待着她的回应，心跳加速，思绪集中在一事上。仿佛过了一个世纪，答案终于来了，丽的声音比之前柔和了许多，几乎带着哀伤。

"Yes." "是的。"

"How and why? Why didn't you tell me?"  
“怎么回事，为什么？你为什么不告诉我？”

"I…I was ordered not to tell you?"  
“我……我被命令不能告诉你？”

"By who?" "被谁？"

"I cannot say." “我不能说。”

"Why? Has he told you not to tell me?"  
“为什么？他是不是告诉你别跟我说？”

"I cannot say." “我不能说。”

Shinji sat back down behind his desk and buried his head in his hands, trying to sort out his thoughts. It was too much for him to take, not only had he found out his father was alive and who his father was, but now that his father was somehow involved in his work as well. He looked over at Rei uncomfortably and noticed her looking down at the picture clutched in her hand. She quickly stood up and made her way towards the office door, not even looking at Shinji on the way out.  
真嗣重新坐回桌后，双手抱头，试图理清思绪。这一切对他来说太过沉重，不仅得知了父亲尚在人世且身份，现在连父亲也牵扯进了他的工作中。他不安地瞥向绫波，注意到她正低头凝视着手中紧握的照片。她迅速起身，径直走向办公室门，离开时甚至没有看真嗣一眼。

"Excuse me, I have to go."  
"对不起，我得走了。"

Shinji could do nothing but just look blankly at where she had just been, he rested his head on his hand, deep in thought.  
真嗣只能茫然地盯着她刚刚所在的地方，他用手撑着头，陷入了沉思。

'_My father… Ayanami… what's their connection?'_  
“我的父亲…绫波…他们之间有什么联系？”

**Twins Residence – 1215 hours  
双胞胎住所 – 12 点 15 分**

"Agent Ikari, what are we doing here?"  
"碇警官，我们在这里做什么？"

"Remember that case I told you about yesterday?"  
"记得我昨天跟你说的那个案子吗？"

"Yes, the one you said Kaji gave you."  
"是的，你说加持给你的那个。"

"Well it wasn't so much a case..."  
"呃，这倒不是说情况有多严重……"

She pulled the car up to the side of the road and glared at him.  
她将车靠边停下，狠狠地瞪了他一眼。

"What do you mean it wasn't so much a case?"  
"你说的‘情况不严重’是什么意思？"

"Well it's not official, this hasn't been cleared with Misato."  
"好吧，这不算正式，还没跟美里商量过。"

"So we're not meant to be here, is that what you're saying?"  
"所以我们不该在这里，你是这个意思吗？"

Shinji grinned slightly and nodded.  
真嗣微微一笑，点了点头。

"Well we're NERV Agents so we do have the authority to go wherever we want, and besides, we could find something useful. If you don't want to be here just drop me off and I'll walk from here you don't have to get in trouble on account of me. I'm here because Kaji said the people involved knew my father."  
"好吧，我们是 NERV 特工，所以我们有权去任何我们想去的地方，而且，我们可能会找到有用的东西。如果你不想待在这里，就把我放下，我自己走回去，你不必因为我而惹上麻烦。我来这里是因为加持说涉及的人认识我父亲。"

Asuka glanced at the folder on the dashboard and then ahead on the road, she could just tell him to get out of the car now and then she could drive back to NERV and not risk her career but she did promise she'd help him out with this.  
明日香瞥了一眼仪表盘上的文件夹，然后看向前方的道路，她完全可以现在让他下车，然后开车回 NERV，不冒着危及自己职业生涯的风险，但她确实答应过要帮他解决这件事。

"Okay, I'll come with you. I did say I owe you one and I'd help you, I guess I don't have a choice."  
"好吧，我会跟你一起去。我确实说过我欠你一个人情，我会帮你，我想我没有选择的余地。"

"Yes you do, you have a future at NERV, you do…"  
"是的，你有，你在 NERV 有未来，你有……"

"I'm not finished, I'll help you with this but promise me you won't turn this into a crusade to find out everything you can about your father. If he's gone to all this trouble to not be found, maybe there's a good reason for it. Maybe some things from your past are better left buried."  
"我还没说完，我会帮你，但你要答应我，不要把这变成一场寻找你父亲所有秘密的十字军。如果他费尽心思不想被找到，也许有他的理由。也许有些过去的事，还是让它埋葬为好。"

He stared at the folder in his hand and contemplated his options.  
他盯着手中文件夹，思索着自己的选择。

"Maybe you're right…." "也许你是对的…."

"I usually am." "我通常都是。"

"Okay, we'll check this out and if I don't find anything then I'll give up."  
“好的，我们会仔细检查，如果我一无所获，那就放弃。”

She sighed and hit her hand off the steering wheel.  
她叹了口气，猛地拍了一下方向盘。

"You're an idiot, I didn't mean just give up I meant just don't turn this into a personal crusade."  
“你真是个傻瓜，我不是说直接放弃，我是说别把这变成个人恩怨。”

"I think I understand, I'll make this up to you though."  
“我想我明白了，不过我会补偿你的。”

"Lunch..." "午餐……"

"Huh?" “啊？”

"You really are dense today, I thought you had gotten rid of your hangover. Buy me lunch."  
"你今天真是迟钝，我还以为你宿醉已经好了。给我买午餐。"

"What now?" "又怎么了？"

"No not now, where are you going to get it from here, the tree on that person's front lawn? After we look at this place."  
“不，现在不行，你打算从哪儿弄来呢，那人前院的树吗？我们先看看这个地方。”

"Ok, sure." “好的，当然。”

She pulled the car away from the curb and began driving towards their destination again, after a short time driving through the streets they eventually came to the street the house was on. However, the scene that greeted them was not the one that Shinji wanted. They pulled up to where the house would be only to find the house burnt down and abandoned. He quickly got out of the car and moved towards the house, Asuka doing the same. Shinji quickly made his way up to the doorway and slammed his fist off the frame in frustration.  
她将车从路边驶离，再次朝着目的地前进。经过一小段时间在街道上行驶，他们最终来到了那座房子所在的街道。然而，映入眼帘的景象并非真嗣所期望的。他们驶近本应是房子所在的位置，却发现房子已被烧毁，荒废不堪。真嗣迅速下车，朝房子走去，明日香也紧随其后。真嗣快步走到门口，一拳砸在门框上，满是懊恼。

"I don't believe it." “我真不敢相信。”

Asuka moved towards him, nervously glancing around.  
明日香朝他走去，紧张地环顾四周。

"What the hell happened here?"  
“这里到底发生了什么？”

There was no chance for a reply as both of them quickly caught sight of a man in a suit turning round the corner of the house. The man quickly pulled out a gun and fired two shots in the direction of the agents. Without thinking Shinji pushed Asuka out of the way and braced himself for the impact of the bullets. After a moment of waiting nothing happened, he looked up and noticed the man still standing there, what really struck him as strange was the bullets the man had fired were now hovering directly in front of Shinji, blocked by some sort of glowing field.  
还没等对方回答，两人就迅速注意到一个穿西装的男人从房子拐角处转了过来。那人迅速掏出手枪，朝着特工们开了两枪。不假思索地，真嗣推开了明日香，准备承受子弹的冲击。等待片刻后，什么也没发生，他抬头一看，发现那人还站在那里，真正让他感到奇怪的是，那人射出的子弹现在正悬浮在他面前，被某种发光的力场挡住了。

Asuka noticed this and quickly got to her feet, pulling out her own pistol, she fired two shots at the man, one bullet hitting him in the head, the other in the stomach. She turned to see the two bullets fired at Shinji falling to the ground and Shinji frozen in shock.  
明日香注意到了这一点，迅速站起身来，拔出自己的手枪，对着那人开了两枪，一发子弹击中了他的头部，另一发打在腹部。她转头看到射向真嗣的两颗子弹落地，真嗣则震惊地呆立原地。

"Agent Ikari, come on." “碇探员，快点。”

They both made their way over to the body of the man Asuka had shot and looked down at him. Asuka recoiled as she saw both the wounds on the man begin to heal up and his eyes flicker open again. The man quickly grabbed hold of Asuka and threw her to the ground as he made his way up. Shinji went to withdraw his own gun but was stopped as the man grabbed his wrist and delivered a quick blow to his gut. Both of the agents gave chase and the man quickly dashed into the nearby trees, both agents fired off shots at the man, only for them to have no effect.  
他们俩走到明日香击中的那人尸体旁，低头看着他。明日香看到那人身上的伤口开始愈合，眼睛再次闪烁着睁开，不禁后退。那人迅速抓住明日香，将她摔倒在地，然后站了起来。真嗣想要拔出自己的枪，却被那人抓住手腕，腹部挨了一记快拳。两位探员紧追不舍，那人迅速冲进附近的树林，他们开枪射击，但子弹毫无效果。

They kept running only for the forest to progressively get darker, suddenly a strange sensation went through Shinji's body. He stopped where he was only to notice Asuka was no longer behind him.  
他们一路狂奔，森林却逐渐变得昏暗，突然间，一种奇异的感觉贯穿了真嗣的身体。他停下脚步，这才发现明日香已不在他身后。

"Agent Sohyu?" “索惠英特工？”

He called out only to receive no reply, he began to backtrack, only to find he no longer recognized the forest he was in.  
他呼喊着，却未得到回应，开始回溯，却发现已不再认识这片森林。

'_What just happened to me?'_  
“我刚刚是怎么了？”

From above he heard a loud rumbling noise, the ground began to shake as he knelt down, looking for the source of the noise. Eventually it appeared, three bright lights making their way slowly over the trees accompanied by a loud rumbling noise. The lights were like those of a search light, they scanned the forest before fixing themselves on Shinji's body. He shielded his eyes and looked up and saw what seemed to be a hatch opening.  
从上方传来一阵隆隆巨响，地面随之震动，他跪下身来，寻找噪音的源头。最终，它出现了，三束明亮的光线缓缓穿过树林，伴随着同样震耳的隆隆声。这些光如同探照灯一般，扫视着森林，最终锁定在真嗣身上。他遮住眼睛，抬头望去，只见似乎是一扇舱门正在开启。

'_Is this… is this really happening?'_  
“这……这是真的在发生吗？”

He began to feel a strange sensation in his body as the same field he saw deflect the bullets began to form around him. In the distance the silhouette of a person came into view, they moved towards him. As they did so he immediately recognized the person.  
他开始感到身体里有一种奇怪的感觉，就像他之前看到弹开子弹的那个力场开始在他周围形成。远处，一个人的轮廓逐渐清晰，他们朝他走来。随着他们的接近，他立刻认出了那个人。

"Ayanami?" "绫波？"

"You must come with me Ikari, you are not ready for this yet."  
“碇，你必须跟我来，你还没准备好面对这个。”

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

She grabbed hold of his hand and began to lead him away from the light, as she touched him everything went dead. The lights vanished, the rumbling ceased and the sun began to pour back into the forest again. He looked around confused, his mind trying to comprehend what had just happened. He looked around trying to find any sign of what was just hovering over him only to find himself alone in the clearing with Agent Ayanami looking at him.  
她抓住他的手，开始带他远离那片光亮，当她触碰到他时，一切都陷入了死寂。灯光消失了，轰鸣声停止了，阳光重新洒回森林。他困惑地环顾四周，试图理解刚刚发生了什么。他四处寻找刚才悬在他上方的迹象，却发现自己独自一人与绫波零站在空地上，她正看着他。

"What…what just happened?"  
“刚…刚才发生了什么？”

He was met with silence from Ayanami, he repeated the question only to be met with silence and Ayanami's red eyes burrowing into him.  
他面对着绫波的沉默，再次提问，却只换来沉默和绫波那双红色眼睛深深地凝视着他。

"How…how did you know we were here?"  
“你……你怎么知道我们在这里？”

This time Ayanami did speak.  
这一次，绫波终于开口了。

"Agent Katsuragi noticed you and Sohryu leaving, she sent me to follow you."  
"Katsuragi 特工注意到你和 Sohryu 离开了，她派我来跟踪你们。"

"You…you've been following us?"  
"你……你一直在跟踪我们？"

"Yes." "“是。””

Shinji knelt down and looked around, noticing Asuka wasn't there.  
真嗣跪下环顾四周，注意到明日香不在那里。

"Where is Agent Sohryu?" “苏茹少校在哪里？”

"She will be here in a minute, we have been looking for you for over an hour."  
“她一会儿就到，我们已经找了你一个多小时了。”

Shinji stared at her in disbelief, even for him someone who did believe in the paranormal, extraterrestrial and other strange phenomena that was too hard to believe. It had felt like he had been there for just under ten minutes, it was impossible for him to have been there for an hour. He glanced at his watch, it had stopped exactly at the time he and Asuka had arrived at the burnt down house. Lost for something to say, he asked Ayanami the only other question he had on his mind.  
真嗣难以置信地盯着她，即便对于他这样一个相信超自然、外星人及其他奇异现象的人来说，这也太难以置信了。他感觉自己只在那里待了不到十分钟，怎么可能已经过去了一个小时。他瞥了一眼手表，指针正好停在他和明日香到达那座烧毁的房子的时间。一时语塞，他向绫波提出了脑海中唯一的另一个问题。

"What did you mean when you said I wasn't ready for this?"  
“你说的我没准备好是什么意思？”

"I never said that." “我从没那么说过。”

"No you did, just then, in the light, you found me and said it?"  
"不，你刚才在光里找到了我，并且说了那句话，对吗？"

"Perhaps you are still unwell, I do not remember any of what you have just said."  
"或许你还未痊愈，我对你刚才说的话毫无印象。"

Shinji stood up, unsure of what to think, Ayanami sounded genuine enough but he had been there, he had witnessed her coming towards him and speaking those words. It was Ayanami, he was sure of it, the person looked exactly like her, he tried to remember exactly what the person looked like. The image of her quickly flashed into his mind.  
真嗣站起身来，心中满是疑惑，绫波的声音听起来足够真诚，但他确实在那里，亲眼目睹她朝自己走来并说出那些话。那就是绫波，他确信无疑，那个人和她长得一模一样，他努力回忆那个人的确切模样。她的形象迅速闪现在他的脑海中。

'_No, it was her, it had to have been, she looked exactly like Ayanami, she had the same body, the same features, everything.'_  
“不，就是她，肯定是她，她看起来和绫波零一模一样，同样的身形，同样的特征，一切都是那么相似。”

"Agent Ikari, are you sure you're alright?"  
"碇君，你确定你没事吗？"

He looked around, it was only him and Ayanami at this moment, he remembered back to what had happened a few hours previous in the office and glanced at Ayanami sheepishly. She looked at him with the same icy expression she always wore, there was no trace of the emotion he had seen from her earlier that day.  
他环顾四周，此刻只有他和绫波在，他回想起几小时前在办公室发生的事情，尴尬地瞥了绫波一眼。她依旧带着那副冰冷的表情看着他，丝毫没有那天早些时候他所见到的情感流露。

"I'm alright, we'd better get Agent Sohryu and get out of here."  
"我没事，我们最好找到惣流探员，然后离开这里。"

"Agreed." "同意。"

Both the agents quickly spun round as there was a rustling behind them. Shinji grabbed his pistol and aimed it towards the sound. He held his breath as Asuka suddenly appeared, recoiling slightly when she saw Shinji's gun pointed at her.  
两位特工迅速转身，背后传来一阵沙沙声。真嗣抓起手枪，对准了声音的方向。他屏住呼吸，只见明日香突然出现，看到真嗣的枪口对准自己时微微一缩。

"Not quite the greeting I think I deserve."  
“这可不是我想得到的问候。”

He lowered the gun, embarrassed.  
他尴尬地放下了枪。

"Sorry I d…" "对不起，我……"

"Doesn't matter, you two need to take a look at something."  
"没关系，你们俩需要来看看这个。"

"What is it?" "什么事？"

She turned back towards where she had just come from as Shinji and Rei followed her back through the trees. Eventually they came towards a small clearing. She pointed towards the center and Shinji noticed what she was pointing at. It was a body, from what Shinji could tell it was a male adult, beyond that however, nothing. He knelt down beside it, looking at it more closely.  
她转身朝她刚来的方向走去，真嗣和丽跟在她身后穿过树林。最终，他们来到了一小片空地。她指向中央，真嗣注意到她所指的东西。那是一具尸体，从真嗣能判断的情况来看，是一名成年男性，除此之外，别无所知。他跪在尸体旁，更仔细地观察着。

"I've never seen anything like this, it's been heavily burnt but it's in some sort of pattern. Who could have done this?"  
"我从没见过这样的东西，烧得很严重，但似乎是某种图案。谁会做这种事呢？"

Asuka shook her head and lowered her voice.  
明日香摇了摇头，压低了声音。

"I don't know, but take a look at the logo on his shirt."  
我不知道，但看看他衬衫上的标志。

Rei knelt down as well and moved the persons jacket revealing the shirt the man was wearing, all three agents recognized it. An image consisting of a downwards pointing triangle with seven eye's within it.  
丽也跪了下来，移动那人的夹克，露出了男子所穿的衬衫，三位特工都认出了它。图案是一个向下指的三角形，里面有七只眼睛。

A/N: Wow chapter 10 already, to be honest I'm not too happy with some parts of this one, it moves the story along but there's something about it I cannot pin point that doesn't work so well. Maybe I'm just being silly, but there's something there I'm not too sure about, I might come back to this one later and try to refine it again. Anyway, hopefully it works for everyone. Thanks for reading so far.  
作者注：哇，已经第十章了，老实说，我对这一章的某些部分不太满意，它推动了故事的发展，但有些东西我无法准确指出，感觉不太对劲。也许我只是有点傻，但确实有些地方我不太确定，可能会在之后回来再尝试修改一下。无论如何，希望这对大家来说还算过得去。感谢大家一直以来的阅读。

### Chapter 11 Dance Like You Want To Win!

**NERV Offices – 1345 hours  
NERV 总部 – 13 时 45 分**

Misato glanced nervously at the clock on her desk, it had been nearly two hours since she had told Rei to follow Shinji and Asuka and bring them back to NERV, yet there had been no contact since that time. She wondered just where Shinji and Asuka were headed and why they left so suddenly. She glanced at the clock again, barely a minute had gone by since she last checked. The excitement of being sent to the same branch of NERV as Shinji was quickly wearing off. At first she was happy she was going to be his immediate superior, after the past few days she just wasn't so sure anymore.  
美里紧张地瞥了一眼桌上的时钟，自从她让绫波跟着真嗣和明日香并带他们回 NERV 已经过去近两个小时了，但自那以后就再无音讯。她想知道真嗣和明日香究竟去了哪里，为何突然离开。她再次瞥向时钟，距离上次查看才过去一分钟。起初，被派到与真嗣同一支 NERV 分部让她兴奋不已，她曾高兴地以为自己将成为他的直接上司，但经过这几天的相处，她不再那么确定了。

It was almost as if he had reverted back to how he was when they first met, he was keeping his distance from her, not telling her anything and doing his best to disobey her, just like he had when he was fourteen before the hospital incident.  
他几乎像是回到了他们初次见面时的状态，与她保持距离，什么都不告诉她，竭力违抗她，就像他十四岁在医院事件之前那样。

'_Is it because we haven't had contact in so long, or is that just how Shinji will always be?'_  
'是因为我们太久没有接触，还是说新司就是这样的人呢？'

Her thoughts wandered over to Shinji's recent discovery about his father and how his father was there in that hospital with them. It didn't make any sense that after more than fifteen years of non-contact his father suddenly reappeared like that, coupled in with the cases both he and Asuka had been sent on recently. She just couldn't see the connection anywhere, unless Shinji was once again withholding information.  
她的思绪飘到了新司最近关于他父亲的发现，以及他父亲当时就在那家医院里与他们在一起的事实。这说不通，超过十五年没有联系的父亲突然就这样出现，再加上他和明日香最近被派去处理的那些案件。她怎么也看不出其中的联系，除非新司又一次隐瞒了信息。

What surprised her most was Asuka's role in this, she didn't seem to be having any problem with going along with Shinji despite her skepticism and the constant disagreements. Compared to what she had read about Agent Sohryu, it seemed out of character, the Agent Sohryu she had heard about was a brilliant Agent determined to rise through the ranks, there was even talk once that Asuka was headed for deputy director in the far future.  
最让她惊讶的是明日香在这件事中的角色，尽管她心存疑虑且时常与真嗣意见不合，却似乎毫无障碍地与他同行。与她所读到的特工惣流相比，这显得格格不入，她听说的那位惣流特工才华横溢，决心在等级制度中攀升，甚至一度有传言说明日香未来有望成为副总监。

'_Is she just trying to find a new way to prove herself? Try to prove something that couldn't be proved and make a name for herself that way?'_  
'她是不是在寻找一种新的方式来证明自己？试图证明那些无法证明的事情，以此来为自己扬名立万？'

Finally there was Agent Ayanami, the mysterious blue haired Agent, no one she had spoke to knew anything about her. A few people mentioned how she was seen in a NERV Office in one area of Japan for one week and then moved to another the next week. No one knew anything about her or who she was. Her records were completely blank aside from the bare essentials and her assignment to her division was incredibly out of the blue as well.  
最后是特工绫波，那位神秘的蓝发特工，她所交谈过的任何人都对她一无所知。有几个人提到她曾在日本某地区的 NERV 办公室待过一周，然后又转移到另一个地区。没有人了解她的任何信息，她的档案除了最基本的信息和分配到她所在部门的情况外，完全是一片空白，而且她的分配也异常突如其来。

'_Rei Ayanami, a twenty eight year old Agent who may as well not exist, she appears twice, one time attacking one of my Agents and then she gets assigned to my division. Just who is she?'_  
“绫波零，一个二十八岁的特工，几乎可以说是隐形人，她出现了两次，一次攻击了我的一个特工，然后就被分配到我的部门。她究竟是谁？”

Before she got a chance to question anything any further there was a knock at her door, she quickly leapt up and dashed over to the door. She opened it hoping it might be the three agents but gave a disappointed sigh when she realized who it was.  
在她有机会进一步质疑任何事情之前，她的门被敲响了，她迅速跳起来冲向门口。她打开门，希望可能是那三位特工，但当她意识到是谁时，失望地叹了口气。

"Oh it's you... What do you want?"  
“哦，是你……你想要什么？”

Kaji grinned at her and stepped forward only to find Misato blocking him from entering the office.  
加持对她咧嘴一笑，向前迈步，却发现美里挡在了他进入办公室的路前。

"I'll ask you again, what do you want?"  
“我再问你一次，你想要什么？”

"I just wanted to see how you were, I noticed your Agents are all out and thought you might be lonely down here on your own. These basement offices aren't exactly full of life from what I've heard."  
“我只是想看看你怎么样，注意到你的特工们都出去了，想着你一个人在这里可能会感到孤单。据我所知，这些地下办公室可不怎么充满生气。”

"I was fed up of the constant parties on the tenth floor, you have five minutes."  
"我受够了十楼没完没了的派对，你还有五分钟。"

He entered the office, Misato closing the door behind him. She made her way back to her desk and watched Kaji as he pulled up a chair next to her. Before he was able to get a word out however Misato was able to get out a question that had been bugging her since the morning.  
他走进办公室，美里在他身后关上门。她回到自己的桌前，看着加持拉过一把椅子坐在她旁边。然而，他还没来得及开口，美里就抢先问出了从早上起一直困扰她的问题。

"Why were you in the director's office earlier today?"  
"今天早上你为什么在司令的办公室里？"

"Oh no reason, he just wanted to talk to me about transferring here."  
"哦，没别的原因，他就是想跟我谈谈转学到这里的事。"

"Aren't you the lucky one, I didn't even get as much as a note."  
"你可真幸运，我连张纸条都没收到。"

"Jealous?" "嫉妒了？"

She glared at him and quickly snapped back.  
她瞪了他一眼，迅速反驳道。

"Of you, you must be joking. What do you really want?"  
“对你来说，你一定是在开玩笑。你到底想要什么？”

"Well actually I was telling the truth but I did want to apologize for what happened on the ship, I shouldn't have told Asuka about Shinji's father."  
“其实我说的都是真话，但我确实想为船上发生的事道歉，我不该告诉明日香关于真嗣父亲的事。”

"You're right, you shouldn't."  
"你说得对，你不应该。"

"But it was only right he found out."  
"但他知道是应该的。"

"Was it? If he hadn't found out maybe now I'd have my three agents back here doing something useful and not going around Tokyo 3 chasing after some ridiculous case, that once again you gave them."  
"真的吗？如果他没发现，也许现在我的三名特工会在这里做些有用的事，而不是在第三新东京市到处追查某个荒谬的案件，这案子又是你交给他们的。"

"I don't know what you mean?"  
"我不明白你的意思？"

"You know exactly what I mean, the case on those twins you gave Shinji. He's followed it up and pulled Asuka into it, I had Rei following them."  
"你心里清楚得很，我指的是你交给真嗣的那对双胞胎的案子。他一直在跟进，还把明日香也牵扯进来了，我让绫波在暗中监视他们。"

Kaji glanced at her, the smile on his face had long since gone, instead it had been replaced with a serious expression.  
加持瞥了她一眼，脸上的笑容早已消失，取而代之的是一副严肃的表情。

"Misato, Shinji isn't fourteen anymore, he can handle himself, as can Agent Sohryu and Ayanami. Shinji's job within this department is to investigate the unexplained, what I gave him was something he would be interested in, even if he hadn't found out about his father."  
"美里，真嗣已经不是十四岁了，他能照顾自己，就像惣流特工和绫波一样。真嗣在这个部门的工作是调查那些无法解释的现象，我给他的东西是他感兴趣的，即使他还没有发现他父亲的事情。"

She raised her voice at him, startling him in the process.  
她提高声音对他说话，吓了他一跳。

"I know he isn't fourteen anymore but that's besides the point… he…. I… forget it."  
"我知道他不再是十四岁，但这不是重点……他……我……算了。"

Misato quickly fought back the tears forming in her eyes and looked out across her office.  
美里迅速忍住眼眶中打转的泪水，环视着自己的办公室。

"I just wanted to help him, but he won't tell me anything, it's like he's avoiding me."  
“我只是想帮他，但他什么都不肯告诉我，好像在躲着我一样。”

"Look, I wasn't there to see what he was like most of the time, all I know is what you've told me, but going by that that's just what he's like. I'm sure he knows what he's doing, besides which even if he doesn't Sohryu and Ayanami will be able to sort him out."  
“听着，我大部分时间没在他身边，所以只知道你告诉我的那些，但根据这些来看，他就是那样的性格。我相信他知道自己该做什么，而且就算他不清楚，绫波和明日香也能搞定他。”

"Maybe you're right, it's just that I can't help but think something's happening and I'm just not being told anything, I mean look at Agent Ayanami. The first contact we had with her was when Shinji was out on a case involving a man named Sachiel, the second time she attacked Agent Sohryu. She actually attacked an agent and then she suddenly gets assigned to work with them, doesn't that seem a little bit strange to you?"  
“也许你是对的，只是我忍不住觉得有什么事正在发生，而我却一无所知。我是说，看看绫波零。我们第一次接触她是在真嗣处理一个涉及名叫萨基尔的男人的案件时，第二次她攻击了惣流探员。她竟然攻击了一名探员，然后突然就被分配与他们一起工作，你不觉得这有点奇怪吗？”

"NERV does operate in strange ways sometimes and gets its Agents to do peculiar things to bring down certain people. Ayanami was probably just one of these Agents, don't delve into it, you'll only be wasting your time."  
"NERV 有时确实会采取一些奇怪的手段，让特工们执行特殊任务来对付某些人。绫波零大概就是其中之一，别深究了，只会浪费你的时间。"

"Possibly, maybe I'm worrying too much."  
"或许，可能我担心过头了。"

**Forest – 1400 hours 森林 – 1400 小时**

"Stupid phone, what are we going to do now. We can't just sit around here with whoever this guy is for company, waiting for our phones to come back on and we can't leave because paranoid Shinji there thinks we won't be able to find the body again if we do leave."  
"这破手机，现在我们该怎么办。总不能就这样和这个不知是谁的家伙干坐着，等着手机信号恢复，而且我们还不能离开，因为那个疑神疑鬼的 Shinji 认为一旦离开我们就找不到尸体了。"

Asuka glared over at Rei and then towards Shinji, at this moment in time hating them both very much, she had started the day off well. Well that was a lie, she had started the day off in one of the worst ways possible, then she had decided to help Shinji with this and now she couldn't help but think she had made a huge mistake, she was cold, wet from the rain that had just started and her headache from earlier that day was starting to return.  
明日香瞪了丽一眼，又转向真嗣，此刻她对他们俩恨之入骨，她本以为今天会是个好日子。好吧，那是个谎言，她以最糟糕的方式开始了这一天，然后她决定帮助真嗣处理这件事，现在她不禁觉得自己犯了个大错，她冷得要命，雨水刚打湿了全身，而早上开始的那阵头痛又回来了。

'_This is stupid, I could be back at the office now, sure it'd be boring but I'd be warm instead of bored, cold and in the company of Shinji, Wondergirl and this dead guy'_  
'这太蠢了，我现在本该在办公室里，虽然会很无聊，但至少我会暖和，而不是无聊、寒冷，还得和真嗣、三无女以及这个死人待在一起。'

"Logically, one of us should make our way out and go to get help."  
“从逻辑上讲，我们应该有个人出去寻求帮助。”

"Well there you go it's settled, I'll go back to NERV and get Misato and transport for the body."  
"好了，就这么定了，我回 NERV 找美里和运送遗体的车。"

Shinji quickly spoke out forcefully enough to startle Asuka.  
真嗣迅速而坚定地说道，足以让明日香吃了一惊。

"No."

"What do you mean no, do you have any better options?"  
"你说的‘不’是什么意思？你有更好的办法吗？"

"If you go you might not be able to find us when you come back."  
"如果你走了，回来时可能找不到我们。"

"I can look after myself you know, look it's the only option we have."  
"我知道我能照顾好自己，你看，这是我们唯一的选择了。"

"We'll stay here for another hour then, and after that we'll see about sending one of us out."  
"我们在这里再等一个小时，之后再考虑派一个人出去。"

This time Shinji wasn't as forceful when he spoke, instead he was speaking much more quietly and softly. Asuka knew immediately that all he had just said about them not being able to find their way back was a lie. There was something else on his mind that he wasn't letting on, something he didn't want to tell them or her. She watched him as he made his way over to the edge of the clearing and sat with his back against one of the trees. She shouted back at him angrily.  
这一次，真嗣说话时不再那么强硬，而是变得更加轻声细语。明日香立刻意识到他刚才所说的关于他们找不到回去的路全是谎言。他心里还藏着别的事情，不想告诉他们或她。她看着他走向空地边缘，背靠一棵树坐下。她生气地朝他喊道。

"Fine, have it your way, but we're wasting our time."  
“好吧，随你便，但我们只是在浪费时间。”

It was perhaps a bit harsh on her part and she almost regretted saying the words but quickly bit back an apology. If he wasn't going to tell her anything, in her mind why should she apologize for one harsh comment? Shinji merely turned his head up towards the sky and looked around absent mindedly, completely ignoring Asuka's comment. Asuka sighed angrily and turned towards Rei, the blue haired agent seemingly taking no notice of the argument or simply not caring.  
这话说得或许有些过分，她几乎后悔说出口，但很快又把道歉的话咽了回去。既然他什么都不打算告诉她，那她凭什么要为一句尖锐的话道歉呢？真嗣只是抬头望向天空，心不在焉地环顾四周，完全无视了明日香的话。明日香气愤地叹了口气，转向丽，那位蓝发特工似乎对这场争执毫不在意，或者根本就不关心。

"So what is your story anyway?"  
"那么，你的故事究竟是什么呢？"

"I do not understand." "我不明白。"

"Well why were you so suddenly assigned to work with us?"  
"嗯，为什么你突然被分配来和我们一起工作？"

"I don't know, I am just carrying out my orders."  
"我不清楚，我只是执行命令而已。"

Shinji raised his head towards the two women, his mind still trying to sort out what had just happened to him.  
真嗣抬起头望向两位女性，他的思绪仍在努力整理刚刚发生在他身上的事情。

'_Have I found what I was looking for?'_  
'我是否找到了我一直在寻找的东西？'

He cast the thought away quickly, not wanting to believe it, despite the fact that his whole purpose within NERV was prove to himself and to others that extraterrestrial life existed. The fact that he could have just came into contact with it was too farfetched.  
他迅速抛开了这个念头，不想相信它，尽管他在 NERV 的全部目的就是为了向自己和他人证明外星生命的存在。而刚刚他可能已经接触到了这一点，这未免太过牵强。

'_The light…the bright light pulling me towards it, was that them? Were they trying to get to me, do they know who I am? It had to have been them but even if it was, no one would believe me. Agent Sohryu…she'd never believe me and Agent Ayanami…she was there coming towards me, she saw it but won't acknowledge it…is she with them? No, she couldn't be, it's impossible.'_  
“那光芒…那明亮的光芒牵引着我，是他们在召唤我吗？他们是否知道我是谁？那一定是他们，但即便如此，也没人会相信我。索留中尉…她绝不会相信我，还有绫波中尉…她当时也在场，朝我走来，她看到了却选择无视…她也是他们的一员吗？不，她不可能，这绝无可能。”

He looked over again, noticing Asuka had now stood up and was now speaking more forcefully at Rei.  
他再次望去，注意到明日香已经站起身，正更加激烈地对绫波说话。

"I suppose it was your orders to attack me as well."  
“我想这也是你的命令，要攻击我吧。”

"My orders are top secret, I cannot tell yo…"  
"我的命令是绝密级的，我不能告诉你……"

"How convenient…if your orders were to kill me would you have done that?"  
"真是方便啊……如果你的命令是杀了我，你会执行吗？"

"If I was ordered to…"  
"如果我被命令这么做……"

Asuka was about to bring her hand back to slap Rei when she felt someone grabbing hold of her wrist. She turned to find Shinji glaring at her angrily, it was almost scary, she had never seen him truly angry. He let go of her wrist and shouted.  
明日香正要将手收回准备扇绫波一巴掌时，突然感到有人抓住了她的手腕。她转头一看，发现真嗣正愤怒地瞪着她，那眼神几乎吓人，她从未见过他真正生气的样子。他松开她的手腕，大声喊道。

"Agent Sohryu stop it, what's gotten into you?"  
“草薙号特工，住手，你这是怎么了？”

She glared back at him not saying anything, her face showing pure rage at Shinji shouting at her, inside she was fighting back tears and the urge to slap him as well. Asuka quickly pushed her way past him out of the clearing, taking her phone out as she reached the edge. Shinji stood there watching her moving out of sight, he was about to call over to her or even go over to see if she was alright but something stopped him. Instead he sank to his knees and turned to Rei.  
她瞪回去，一言不发，脸上满是对真嗣吼她的愤怒，内心却在强忍泪水和扇他一巴掌的冲动。明日香迅速推开他，走出空地，一到边缘就掏出手机。真嗣站在那里，看着她消失在视线中，本想叫住她或甚至过去看看她是否还好，但某种东西阻止了他。相反，他跪倒在地，转向绫波。

"Sorry…" "对不起…"

"What for?" "为什么？"

"For what just happened, not exactly the best introduction to how we work."  
"对于刚刚发生的事，这可不算我们工作方式的最佳介绍。"

"Is this what it is usually like?"  
"平时都是这样的吗？"

"No, usually it's alright. I mean she's usually making jokes at my expense but nothing like that has ever happened before."  
"不，通常还好。我是说她平时常拿我开玩笑，但像刚才那样的事从没发生过。"

"I see." "原来如此。"

"Although you and her didn't really have the best first meeting, you know with the whole you attacking her thing."  
"虽然你和她初次见面并不算愉快，毕竟你攻击了她。"

He smiled trying to make a joke out of it, Reis expression remained fixed.  
他试图用微笑化解尴尬，但莱斯的表情依旧冷峻。

"I was only doing what I had been told to do, would you and her not have done the same?"  
"我只是执行命令，如果换成你和她，难道不会这么做吗？"

"Maybe, it depends on what we would have been told I guess. I'm not the best person to ask about that, I don't really have the best track record with NERV."  
"或许吧，这取决于我们会被告知什么，我想。我不是问这个的最佳人选，我对 NERV 的记录并不怎么好。"

"I did not know that, if this is what it is going to be like, maybe I should request a transfer."  
"我之前不知道，如果情况会是这样，也许我应该申请调职。"

Shinji turned to Rei, her voice had remained the same but there was almost a look of hurt across her face. He lowered his head trying to think of what to say, he had already angered Rei today and he didn't have any intention of driving her away with his words.  
真嗣转向绫波，她的声音依旧平静，但脸上几乎流露出一丝受伤的神情。他低下头，努力思考该说些什么，今天他已经惹恼了绫波，他无意再用言语将她推开。

"You don't have to do that, maybe you should try apologizing to her though, it might be a start."  
"你不必这么做，不过或许你应该试着向她道歉，这可能是个开始。"

Just outside of the clearing Asuka was leaning against a tree, listening into the conversation. She looked around noticing both Rei and Shinji were talking, their backs away from where she was. She wiped her eyes on her sleeve and checked her phone again.  
在空地外，明日香靠在一棵树上，偷听着对话。她环顾四周，注意到绫波和真嗣正在交谈，他们的背对着她所在的地方。她用袖子擦了擦眼睛，再次查看手机。

'_Why am I getting upset over this? It's stupid just because the idiot raised his voice, that's no reason to upset, I don't get upset at other things. Just because he's standing up for that blue haired bitch._  
'我为什么要为这种事生气？这太蠢了，就因为那白痴提高了嗓门，这不足以让我生气，我对其他事情并不生气。只是因为他为那个蓝发婊子辩护。

She looked and noticed her phone appeared to be giving her a signal now, she was about to dial in the number for Misato when she heard Shinji speaking near her, startling her slightly.  
她看了看，注意到手机似乎现在有信号了，正要拨打美里小姐的号码时，听到了真嗣在她附近说话，让她稍微吓了一跳。

"Agent Sohryu, are you alright?"  
“惣流小姐，你还好吗？”

She looked at him and spoke.  
她看着他，开口说道。

"Yes of course I am I was just checking the phone again, we're getting a signal now so we can probably get in contact with Katsuragi."  
“当然在啊，我只是在再次检查手机，现在有信号了，我们可以联系上葛城小姐了。”

"Good, tell her we need an autopsy performed on the body. Preferably by someone we can trust."  
"好，告诉她我们需要对尸体进行尸检。最好是找我们信得过的人来做。"

"Leave it to me, I know the perfect person who can do it for us."  
"交给我吧，我知道有个合适的人选能帮我们完成这件事。"

**Morgue – 1615 hours 太平间 —— 16 点 15 分**

"I can't believe you talked me into doing this."  
"真不敢相信你居然说服我做这事。"

"Oh come on Hikari, we need you to do this."  
"哎呀，光，我们正需要你来完成这个任务。"

"Why me? Any of the other people here could have done it. I'm a lecturer at the academy not a field agent. Besides, it's against regulations, you haven't even gotten permission to do this."  
"为什么是我？这里其他人都能做。我只是学院的讲师，不是外勤特工。而且，这违反规定，你甚至还没得到执行这个任务的许可。"

"Look, the body is unidentified and died under mysterious circumstances. We have our director of operation's blessing on this."  
"看，这具尸体身份不明，死因神秘。我们得到了行动主任的批准。"

"Unidentified by whom?" "谁无法确认身份？"

"Well me and Agent Ikari but…"  
"我和碇探员都未能确认，但是……"

"Agent Ikari, you're doing this for him? I'm surprised at you, I thought you would have been more intelligent than that."  
"碇指挥官，你这么做是为了他？我对你感到惊讶，我以为你会更明智一些。"

"I'm not doing this for him, and what do you mean more intelligent?"  
"我不是为了他这么做，你说的更明智是什么意思？"

"As much as I feel sorry for him, and the way many Agents within NERV ridicule him for his beliefs, sometimes I can't help but think he deserves it. I mean, he threw away a career here to look into such ridiculous things as the paranormal and aliens."  
"虽然我对他感到同情，以及 NERV 中许多特工因他的信仰而嘲笑他，有时我不禁觉得他活该。我是说，他放弃在这里的事业去研究那些荒谬的东西，比如超自然现象和外星人。"

"So he's a bit strange, is that really important? Besides which, he isn't the one asking for this, I am, so are you going to do it?"  
"所以他有点古怪，这真的很重要吗？再说了，提出这个请求的人不是他，是我，你到底做不做？"

Hikari sighed and looked at her friend  
光叹了口气，看着她的朋友

"I guess so, I'm here now aren't I? Show me the body."  
"我想是的，我现在不就在这儿吗？让我看看尸体。"

Asuka nodded and turned towards the entrance to the morgue, the two of them entered the room to find Shinji already standing there waiting for them. He made his way over to them both and extended his hand out to Hikari.  
明日香点点头，转身朝停尸房的入口走去，两人进入房间，发现真嗣已经站在那里等着他们。他走向两人，向光伸出手。

"Agent Horaki, thanks for doing this on such short notice."  
“堀木探员，感谢你在这么短的时间内赶来。”

She shook his hand and smiled back at him politely.  
她握住他的手，礼貌地向他微笑。

"Not a problem, I just need to ask a few questions first. What was the body's condition when you found it?"  
"没问题，我先问几个问题。你发现尸体时，它的状况如何？"

"Heavily burnt across the face, and throughout the body there were burns everywhere. The victim was wearing a uniform of some sort, with a logo which had seven eyes within it on the shirt. The victim had no belongings of any sort, no ID, no wallet or anything."  
"面部严重烧伤，全身各处都有烧伤痕迹。受害者穿着某种制服，衬衫上有一个包含七只眼睛的标志。受害者没有任何个人物品，没有身份证，没有钱包，什么都没有。"

"I see, well lets get started."  
"我明白了，那我们开始吧。"

Hikari walked over to a counter and picked up a small recording device, she pressed one of the buttons on it and spoke into it.  
光走到了一个柜台前，拿起一个小型录音设备，按下其中一个按钮，对着它说道。

"Beginning autopsy at four twenty pm, Autopsy is being performed by Agent Hikari Horaki with Agent's Sohryu and Ikari present."  
“下午四点二十分开始进行尸检，尸检由特工光堀木执行，特工惣流和真嗣在场。”

She removed the covers, revealing the body on the counter and stepped back in surprise at the state of the body. The face was just as Shinji had said, completely charred and unrecognizable, the rest of the body was also severely burned. She spoke into the device again.  
她掀开覆盖物，露出了柜台上的尸体，后退一步，对尸体的状况感到惊讶。正如真嗣所说，脸部完全烧焦，无法辨认，身体的其他部分也严重烧伤。她再次对着设备说道。

"I have just removed the cover and taken my first look at the body, victim is male and has severe burning on the face and throughout the body. The burns appear to be in some sort of pattern and have been inflicted by someone else. There also appear to be two stitched wounds around the sides of the body. From initial observation I'd estimate time of death to be around twelve thirty today."  
"我刚刚揭开覆盖物，第一次看到了尸体。受害者是男性，面部和全身都有严重的烧伤。烧伤呈现出某种图案，似乎是他人所为。身体两侧还各有两处缝合的伤口。根据初步观察，我估计死亡时间大约是今天的十二点半。"

Asuka and Shinji exchanged a glance, that was about the same time they had entered the forest. They let Hikari continue speaking.  
明日香和真嗣交换了一个眼神，大约是在他们进入森林的时候。他们让光继续说话。

"The pattern on the body seems to consist of eleven circular sections, all connected to each other."  
“身体上的图案似乎由十一个圆形部分组成，所有部分都相互连接。”

Shinji's quickly moved forward and began looking at the body more carefully, counting each of the circular sections Hikari had mentioned and the number of connections. Hikari paused the recording the device and spoke to him.  
真嗣迅速上前，开始更仔细地观察身体，数着光提到的每个圆形部分和连接数。光暂停了录音设备，对他说话。

"What is it?" "什么事？"

"The marking, what you just said reminded me of where I've seen it before. It's a Jewish Religious symbol, the tree of life."  
"那个标记，你刚才说的让我想起了我之前在哪里见过它。这是一个犹太宗教符号，生命之树。"

"I see." "原来如此。"

She un-paused the device and began speaking again.  
她解除了设备的暂停，又开始说话了。

"I am now beginning the internal examination."  
"我现在开始进行内部检查。"

She put the recorder down on the counter and picked up a scalpel. She looked up at Asuka and Shinji and smiled.  
她将录音机放在柜台上，拿起一把手术刀。她抬头看向明日香和真嗣，微笑着。

"You two don't have to stay for this part you know."  
“你们俩其实不必留下来观看这部分的。”

They both looked at her and nodded but remained where they were. Hikari made her way over to the body and began to make a vertical incision into it, from the base of the throat down towards the pelvis. The first thing she noticed when she opened the body was the blood within it, it was a strange orange color. She looked up at Asuka and questioned her.  
他们俩都看着她，点头示意，但依旧留在原地。光走到尸体旁，开始从喉咙底部向下至骨盆处划出一道垂直切口。她打开尸体时首先注意到的是里面的血液，呈现出一种奇怪的橙色。她抬头看向明日香，提出了疑问。

"Have you ever seen anything like this?"  
"你见过这样的东西吗？"

Asuka nodded. 明日香点点头。

"Yes, several times, we don't know where it comes from, only that it's been present in some of the cases we've been a part of. All we know is it's called LCL, I've ran tests on it only to find it is a ninety nine percent match to human blood. It seems to act in the same way as well."  
"是的，见过几次，我们不知道它从何而来，只知道在我们参与的一些案件中出现过。我们所知的就是它被称为 LCL，我对其进行了测试，结果发现它与人类血液的匹配度高达百分之九十九。它的作用方式似乎也相同。"

"I see, well I don't think we can use this for identification so we'll have to make do with something else, I do however want to take a sample of it to analyze further."  
"我明白了，不过我认为这东西不适合用来识别身份，我们得另想办法。不过，我确实想取一些样本进行进一步分析。"

"I can take care of that, if you want."  
"如果你愿意，我可以处理这个。"

"Thanks, ok now to take a look inside."  
"谢谢，好的，现在我们来看看里面。"

Shinji stared down to the ground at hearing her say that, he tried to focus his thoughts on something else for that moment, while he waited for Hikari to finish. Asuka also took to looking at the other side of the room, at the now highly interesting cabinet full of test tubes and other scientific devices. After what seemed like an eternity, Hikari finally spoke, her voice slightly jubilant at seeing the two agents doing their best not to look at the body.  
听到她这么说，真嗣低头盯着地面，试图在那片刻间将思绪转移到其他事情上，同时等待着光子完成。明日香也转向房间的另一侧，目光落在那排装满试管和其他科学仪器的橱柜上，此刻它显得异常引人入胜。仿佛过了一个世纪，光子终于开口了，看到两位特工尽力不去看尸体，她的声音中略带喜悦。

"You two can look now, I'm done with the body."  
“你们俩现在可以看了，我对尸体的工作完成了。”

They both stepped forward towards her and looked at her expectantly. Asuka was the first to speak.  
他们俩都向前迈步走向她，期待地看着她。明日香率先开口。

"So, what did you find?"  
"那么，你发现了什么？"

"Aside from the liquid you call LCL nothing unusual inside the body. That's not what concerns me though, I did find trace amounts of actual blood within the body. I'd have to run some tests on it, but it looked as if it was turning into the LCL substance. I also found out the cause of death."  
"除了你们称之为 LCL 的液体外，体内并无异常。但这并不是我担心的，我在体内发现了微量真正的血液。我需要做一些测试，但看起来它似乎正在转化为 LCL 物质。我还查明了死因。"

"The burns?" "烧伤吗？"

"Surprisingly no, our victim suffered what I can only describe as a complete system failure. His entire body just…shut down. What is really strange is that it seems like the burn marks on the victim came after he died, at least a good couple of hours or so later."  
"出乎意料的是，我们的受害者遭受了我只能形容为系统完全崩溃的情况。他的整个身体就这样……关闭了。真正奇怪的是，受害者身上的烧伤似乎是在他死后才出现的，至少是几个小时之后。"

"But who would have done such a thing?"  
"但谁会做出这样的事呢？"

"I don't know, that's yours and Agent Ikari's job to find out. At a guess I'd say some strange religious cult. Agent Ikari mentioned it was the tree of life on the victim's body, victims of sacrifices often have religious markings engraved into them."  
"我不知道，那是你和碇探员的任务去查明。我猜可能是某个奇怪的宗教团体。碇探员提到受害者身上有生命之树的图案，被献祭的受害者通常会有宗教标记刻在他们身上。"

Asuka tilted her head and looked at the body on the slab, her eyes wandered to the stitch marks on the sides of the body.  
明日香歪着头，看着解剖台上那具尸体，她的目光游移到尸体两侧的缝合痕迹上。

"What about the wounds on the sides of the body?"  
"那尸体两侧的伤口呢？"

"I took a look and found nothing, again just speculation but I'd say bullet wounds. Maybe from a similar type of weapon to the ones NERV issue out to its agents. Upon closer inspection there were more wounds, all of them sustained today."  
"我看了一眼，什么也没发现，只是猜测，但我觉得可能是枪伤。或许是与 NERV 发给其特工类似的武器造成的。仔细检查后发现还有更多伤口，都是今天造成的。"

"What time?" "什么时间？"

"I honestly couldn't say, they look recent though."  
"老实说我无法确定，但看起来很新鲜。"

The man from earlier that day flashed into Asuka's mind, she and Shinji had fired four shots at him, however he recovered from them immediately. There was also the matter of the time of death, according to Hikari the time of death was about the time they entered the forest, the same time the man they were chasing had escaped and the same time she lost track of Shinji. Also, the exact same time she had encountered Agent Ayanami in the forest. She bit her bottom lip and looked over towards Shinji, he too appeared to be deep in thought about the whole thing. He looked up at her and then turned to Hikari and spoke.  
那天早些时候遇见的那个男人突然闪现在明日香的脑海中，她和真嗣曾向他开了四枪，然而他立刻就恢复了。还有死亡时间的问题，根据光的说法，死亡时间大约是他们进入森林的时候，也正是他们追捕的那个人逃脱的时间，也是她跟丢真嗣的时间。同样，正是她在森林中遇到绫波零特工的时间。她咬了咬下唇，转头看向真嗣，他似乎也在深思整个事件。他抬头看着她，然后转向光，开口说道。

"Is there any chance we could get a positive identification on the body?"  
“我们有没有可能得到尸体的正面确认？”

"It'll be difficult, but there are still a few things left I can use to get an ID."  
“这会很困难，但我还有几样东西可以用来获取身份信息。”

"Thanks, can you do it now please?"  
"谢谢，你现在能做吗？"

"Umm sure, it might take a while though so you two might want to wait outside."  
"嗯，当然可以，不过可能需要一些时间，你们俩或许想在外面等。"

"Fine with me." "我没问题。"

The two of them made their way out of the morgue, leaving Hikari to do her job. Once outside Asuka, quickly turned to Shinji and spoke.  
两人离开了停尸间，留下光独自工作。一出门，明日香迅速转向真嗣，开口说道。

"It was Agent Ayanami." "是绫波零特工。"

"What, what are you talking about?"  
"什么，你在说什么呢？"

"Look, think about it right. The time of death was about the same time we lost track of him, the same time I got separated from you. A few minutes later I encountered Agent Ayanami in the forest. That person in there is the same person we were chasing, it has to be, there's no other possibility."  
"听着，仔细想想。死亡时间大约就是我们失去他的踪迹，我与你分开的时候。几分钟后我在森林里遇到了绫波零。里面那个人就是我们追捕的对象，一定是，没有其他可能。"

Shinji sighed and looked at her in disbelief, he thought about her explanation. It did make sense but he knew Ayanami couldn't have done that. He thought about what happened to him earlier in the forest and wondered if he should tell Asuka about it.  
真嗣叹了口气，难以置信地看着她，思考着她的解释。确实有道理，但他知道绫波不可能做出那种事。他回想起之前在森林里发生的事，犹豫是否应该告诉明日香。

"It can't have been. There was only a few minutes between you losing sight of him and then encountering Ayanami. She wouldn't have had time to kill him and then burn all that into him. Besides which, there was…."  
"不可能的。你失去他的踪迹到遇见绫波之间只有几分钟。她不可能有时间杀了他再把他烧成那样。而且，还有……"

He quickly stopped himself from telling her about the light her saw and Ayanami coming towards him and freeing him from it.  
他迅速制止了自己告诉她关于他看到的光和她朝他走来并解救他的事情。

"There was what exactly?"  
“那究竟是什么？”

"There was no way she could have caused all of his major organs to fail all in one go, I will admit there is a lot we don't know about her, but she isn't a murderer."  
“我不认为她能一次性导致他所有主要器官衰竭，我承认我们对她的了解还不够，但她绝不是凶手。”

"Unless it was in her orders to do so."  
"除非这是她的命令。"

"I think you're being unfair to her."  
"我觉得你对她不公平。"

"Unfair? She attacked me, she came at me, unprovoked, with a knife, Ikari. She doesn't even have the guts to apologize to me later and expects me to be fine with it, just because she was carrying out 'orders'?"  
"不公平？她攻击了我，无缘无故地拿着刀冲向我，碇。事后她甚至没胆量向我道歉，还指望我因为她是执行'命令'就没事了？"

"I guess…maybe you're right. It's just when you were away I had to work on something with her, take down some guy called Ramiel."  
"我想……也许你是对的。只是当你不在的时候，我不得不和她一起工作，对付一个叫拉米尔的家伙。"

"Yes I know, I read the case report, what about it?"  
"是的，我知道，我读过案件报告，怎么了？"

"She told me she has nothing else but NERV, I'm angry that she attacked you and I wish we knew more about her, but if she thinks she has nothing else then how can we blame her for it?"  
"她告诉我她除了 NERV 一无所有，她攻击了你，我感到愤怒，希望我们能了解更多关于她的事情，但如果她认为自己别无选择，我们又怎能怪她呢？"

"Fine, whatever, I can't be bothered to argue with you. I'll tolerate her for now."  
“好吧，随便了，我懒得跟你争。暂时我会容忍她的。”

"Thank you." “谢谢。”

The area fell into silence as they both waited for Hikari to exit with some news. After a short while the door opened and Hikari stood there with a bewildered expression.  
随着两人等待光出来带来消息，这片区域陷入了寂静。不久，门打开了，光站在那里，脸上带着困惑的表情。

"I…have some news regarding our victim."  
"我……关于我们的受害者，有一些消息。"

**Stooges Residence – 1800 hours  
斯图基斯住所 – 晚上六点**

"You knew that was going to happen didn't you?"  
"你早就知道会发生这种事，对吧？"

Shinji grinned and looked out the car window.  
真嗣咧嘴一笑，望向车窗外面。

"Yes, as soon as I saw that logo on his shirt I had a feeling something like that would happen. You were thinking the same thing though weren't you."  
"是的，我一看到他衬衫上的那个标志就有种预感会发生这种事。不过你当时也是这么想的，对吧？"

"What, that when we did get a positive ID we'd find nothing on the victim? I had a vague idea, seems to be the way our cases go, we find someone try to find out who they are and run into a brick wall."  
"什么，我们好不容易确认了身份却发现受害者毫无线索？我有个模糊的想法，似乎我们办案总是这样，找到某人试图查明他们的身份，结果却碰了一鼻子灰。"

"Right, someone doesn't want us to find out anything about those people. Agent Ayanami, my father, that victim the source of these cases we've been sent on, they're all connected, the only question is why?"  
"没错，有人不希望我们查出那些人的任何信息。特工绫波，我父亲，还有这些案件中的受害者，他们都有关联，唯一的问题是为什么？"

"Ayanami?" "绫波？"

"I believe so, although unlike the others I don't think she understands why. She's only carrying out the wishes of the others."  
"我想是的，尽管与其他人不同，我认为她并不明白为什么。她只是在执行其他人的意愿。"

"What about our victim?" “我们的受害者怎么办？”

Shinji thought about it for a moment and said the only thing that came to his mind.  
真嗣思索片刻，说出了脑海中唯一浮现的答案。

"Maybe he disobeyed them, or they ran out of a use for him?"  
"也许他违背了他们的命令，或者他们对他已经没有利用价值了？"

Asuka pulled the car into the parking lot and looked up at the apartment. She sighed and hung her head in disgust.  
明日香将车驶入停车场，抬头望向公寓。她叹了口气，厌恶地垂下了头。

"Ok, so I understand all that, the only question is why did we have to visit the two stooges?"  
"好吧，这些我都明白了，唯一的问题是我们为什么非得去见那两个傻瓜？"

Shinji laughed at her comment and opened the car door.  
真嗣对她的评论笑了笑，然后打开了车门。

"Because despite being 'stooges' as you put it, they can also help us get more information on our victim, just like they were able to get more information on Ayanami."  
"因为尽管你称他们为'傀儡'，他们也能帮我们获取更多关于受害者的信息，就像他们能获取更多关于绫波的信息一样。"

"Yes but when they got the information on Ayanami the information was subsequently hidden by that same logo we keep seeing."  
"是的，但当他们获取了关于绫波的情报后，那些信息随即被我们一直看到的那个标志隐藏起来了。"

"Simple, we'll get them to print it as soon as it appears on screen."  
简单，一旦屏幕上出现，我们就让他们立即打印。

"Right, I still don't like the idea of it though, you realize what happens if we get caught?"  
"没错，尽管如此，我还是不喜欢这个主意，你知道如果我们被抓到会发生什么吗？"

"Yes I do, but if we find out the truth in the process it's worth it. Besides which you just had your friend perform an unofficial autopsy."  
"是的，我赢了，但如果我们在过程中发现真相，那就值得。再说，你刚刚让你的朋友进行了非官方的尸检。"

"Well that's different…that's…alright you win."  
"好吧，这不一样……这……好吧，你赢了。"

They both stepped out of the car and made their way up to the apartment, once there Shinji knocked on the door and waited for an answer. A few moments passed with no answer so he knocked again, receiving no reply once more.  
他们俩下了车，向公寓走去。到了门口，真嗣敲了敲门，等待回应。几秒钟过去了，无人应答，于是他又敲了一次，依然没有回音。

"They're…. not in? What is this world coming to if they of all people aren't in?"  
“他们……不在？如果连他们都缺席，这世界是怎么了？”

Shinji couldn't help himself but laugh, he would have tried to defend his friends but in this case he had nothing. A noise was heard on the other side of the door, Shinji stopped laughing in time to hear Kensuke's voice.  
真嗣忍不住笑出声来，他本想为朋友们辩解，但这次他无话可说。门那边传来一阵声响，真嗣及时止住笑声，听到了健介的声音。

"Who is it?" “是谁？”

Shinji called through the door.  
真嗣对着门喊道。

"It's Ikari and Sohryu, open up."  
"是碇和绫波，开门吧。"

The familiar sound of the locks being opened was heard and the door finally opened to reveal Kensuke standing there wearing a pink apron with a spatula in his hand. Asuka immediately burst out laughing, causing Shinji to do the same. Kensuke just stood there glaring at them both.  
熟悉的开锁声响起，门终于打开，露出穿着粉色围裙、手持铲子的真希波。明日香立刻爆发出笑声，让真嗣也跟着笑了起来。真希波只是站在那里，瞪着他们俩。

"Yeah yeah hilarious isn't it, what do you both want?"  
"是啊是啊，真是搞笑，你们俩到底想要什么？"

"Sorry, we need your help again, although if you're busy we could always come back later."  
"抱歉，我们又需要你的帮助了，不过如果你现在忙的话，我们可以晚点再来。"

Shinji made his way into the apartment and Asuka soon followed, still grinning heavily, as she walked past Kensuke she couldn't help but comment.  
Shinji 走进公寓，Asuka 很快跟了进来，仍然笑得很开心，当她经过 Kensuke 时，忍不住评论道。

"So what are you cooking? You know the apron suits you, maybe you should wear it more often."  
“你在做什么菜呢？你知道这围裙很适合你，或许你应该多穿穿。”

They made their way into the main living area, just like Asuka expected the room was exactly the same as it had been when they were last in there. Cables all over the place linked up to computers, in fact Asuka could have sworn more had been added since they were last here. Touji turned around from his screen and noticed they had entered the room.  
他们走进了主生活区，正如 Asuka 所预料的那样，房间和上次他们在这里时一模一样。到处都是连接到电脑的电缆，实际上，Asuka 几乎可以发誓自从上次他们来过之后，这里又增加了一些。Touji 从他的屏幕上转过身来，注意到他们已经进入了房间。

"Hey Shinji, how ya doing man?"  
"嘿，真嗣，最近怎么样，伙计？"

"I'm good, look we have something we need you guys to look into again."  
"我没事，听着，我们有件事需要你们再调查一下。"

"Not a problem, what is it?"  
"没问题，是什么事？"

"We need you to look up a person again, although this time as soon as the information appears we need you to print it out. We're expecting that logo to flash up again and block access."  
"我们需要你再次查找一个人的信息，不过这次一旦信息出现，我们需要你立即打印出来。我们预计那个标志会再次闪现并阻止访问。"

"Not a problem, when do you need it by?"  
"没问题，你们什么时候需要？"

"As soon as possible." "尽快。"

"I can get to work on it now, I got a few new things installed that I want to test out anyway. Why do you need it anyway?"  
"我现在就可以开始工作了，我刚装了几个新东西，正好想测试一下。话说回来，你为什么需要这个？"

"Can't say I'm afraid, we don't even know ourselves."  
"不能说我害怕，我们甚至还不了解自己。"

"Well be sure to let us know when you do because we might be able to help out."  
"那一旦知道了，一定要告诉我们，因为我们或许能帮上忙。"

"Sure thing." "当然可以。"

Shinji was about to give Touji the name of the person when his cell phone began to ring. He answered it quickly and began to speak only to be cut off by the other person, almost immediately.  
真嗣正要告诉冬二对方的名字，这时他的手机响了。他迅速接起电话，刚要开口就被对方打断，几乎是立刻。

"Hel…" "喂…"

"_Shinji, it's Kaji there isn't much time for this, you and Sohryu have to get to Ayanami's apartment immediately."_  
"真嗣，我是加持，时间紧迫，你和惣流必须立刻赶到绫波的公寓。"

**Reis Apartment – 1900 hours  
雷斯公寓 —— 晚上七点整**

Storm clouds had begun to appear over the apartment complex as Shinji and Asuka pulled up outside the building. Much to their surprise Rei's apartment was situated in one of the more run down areas of the city. The building itself looked old and nearly ready to be demolished. Asuka shouted over to Shinji as they made their way up towards the entrance.  
当真嗣和明日香驶近大楼时，公寓楼群上空已经开始聚集起风暴云。令他们惊讶的是，绫波的公寓位于城市中较为破旧的区域之一。大楼本身看起来老旧，几乎快要被拆除。明日香一边向入口走去，一边大声对真嗣喊道。

"Are you sure this is the place?"  
"你确定是这里吗？"

"Yes, this is the address Kaji gave me. He said to get to Ayanami's apartment immediately and then gave me this address."  
"是的，这是加持给我的地址。他说要我立刻赶到绫波的公寓，然后给了我这个地址。"

"How could she live in such a place, it's disgusting."  
“她怎么能住在这种地方，太恶心了。”

"I don't know, we don't have time for this, let's get up there quickly."  
“我不知道，我们没时间了，快点上去吧。”

They both quickly made their way into the dark hallway, just as they did so the sound of thunder roared over head. Shinji made his way forward and the smell of damp attacked his nostrils, he turned to see the rain had started to come down heavily outside and had already began to run down the walls of the hallway. They made their way towards the staircase and began to climb up it, slowly withdrawing their hand guns ready for whatever might be up there.  
他们两人迅速进入昏暗的走廊，就在这时，雷声轰鸣在头顶响起。真嗣向前走去，潮湿的气味扑鼻而来，他转身看到外面的雨已经开始倾盆而下，雨水已经顺着走廊的墙壁流淌。他们向楼梯走去，开始攀爬，慢慢地拔出手枪，准备应对楼上可能出现的任何情况。

Eventually they came to the third floor, just where Shinji had been told Rei's apartment was located. They turned into the corridor, the first thing Shinji noticed being the figure lying unconscious on the ground. Shinji ran towards it and immediately recognized it as Rei, he turned towards Asuka who was also kneeling down besides Rei.  
最终他们来到了三楼，正是被告知绫波的公寓所在的地方。他们走进走廊，真嗣首先注意到的是一个昏迷倒在地上的身影。真嗣跑向她，立刻认出那是绫波，他转向旁边的明日香，她也正跪在绫波身旁。

"Room 302, this is her apartment."  
"302 室，这是她的公寓。"

"Yes, call for help I'll check out the apartment."  
"好的，呼叫救援，我去查看一下公寓。"

He stood back up and edged towards the room, the door was already open so he moved slowly inside. As he stepped inside he wondered how a person could live like this, the apartment wasn't even what could be called an apartment, it consisted of a bed on one side of the room, a single chest of drawers, a small kitchen and a door leading to a bathroom. No more and no less. He stepped into the main area and noticed two figures, he aimed his pistol at them only to find out they were two young girls.  
他重新站起身，小心翼翼地向房间移动，门已经开着，他缓慢地走了进去。一进门，他就疑惑一个人怎么能这样生活，这间公寓甚至不能称之为公寓，它仅由房间一侧的床、一个单屉柜、一个小厨房和通往浴室的门组成。不多也不少。他走进主区域，注意到两个身影，他举枪对准她们，却发现是两个小女孩。

'_Could these be the twins Kaji spoke about… no, they were nineteen, these girls couldn't be a day over eight'_  
'这难道是卡吉提到的双胞胎吗…不，她们已经十九岁了，这两个女孩看起来不超过八岁'

He lowered the gun and observed the two girls, they were looking at him but not speaking. They were identical with no noticeable differences, between them on the floor was a small doll. Shinji knelt down and spoke to them.  
他放下枪，观察着两个女孩，她们看着他却不说话。她们长得一模一样，没有任何明显的区别，她们之间的地板上躺着一个小小的玩偶。真嗣跪下来，对她们说道。

"Are you two alright, what are you doing here?"  
"你们两个还好吗，在这里做什么？"

Shinji turned and saw Asuka now entering the room, she looked at the two girls with a look of confusion and then her eyes wandered to the doll. Shinji looked at her as she stood there transfixed on the doll.  
真嗣转身，看到明日香此刻走进房间，她困惑地看着两个女孩，随后目光落在了娃娃上。真嗣望着她，只见她站在那里，目光紧紧锁定在娃娃上。

"Agent Sohryu are you al…"  
"索吕鲁小姐，你还好吗……"

He was cut off as the two girls began to speak.  
他的话被两个女孩的交谈声打断了。

"We were playing with our doll, but she isn't well."  
“我们在和我们的娃娃玩，但她不太舒服。”

Shinji's eyes darted back and forth between the two children, they spoke in unison. He replied to them softly.  
真嗣的目光在两个孩子之间来回游移，他们异口同声地说着。他轻声回应。

"Who are you both?" “你们两位是谁？”

"Do you want to see our doll, we think she's dead. Her name is Asu…"  
"你想看看我们的玩偶吗？我们觉得她死了。她的名字叫明日…"

"YOU BITCHES!" "你们这些婊子！"

Asuka aimed her gun at the doll and fired a shot directly at it, taking the head completely off of the doll. She then aimed her gun at the girl on the right only to have Shinji grab hold of her hand and push the gun out of the way.  
明日香将枪口对准了玩偶，一枪将其头部完全击飞。随后，她将枪口转向右边的女孩，却被真嗣抓住手腕，将枪口推开。

"What are you doing, they're only small children?"  
"你在做什么，他们只是小孩子？"

The child on the right began to speak, closely followed by the girl on the left.  
右边的孩子开始说话，紧接着左边的小女孩也开口了。

"Yes we're only…" “是的，我们只是……”

"…small children." "…小孩子们。"

Shinji turned his head towards them after hearing them speak, their voices had changed that time. As he turned he found the two young girls had gone, instead now standing before him were two nineteen year old girls. Shinji released his grip on Asuka's hand and aimed his pistol at them, Asuka not speaking but also doing the same. He stammered out.  
听到她们说话后，真嗣转过头去，那次她们的声音变了。当他转身时，发现那两个小女孩已经不见了，取而代之的是两个十九岁的女孩站在他面前。真嗣松开了握着明日香的手，举起手枪对准她们，明日香没有说话，但也同样举枪。他结结巴巴地说道。

"Wha… what are you?" "什…你是什么？"

They once again spoke each one finishing off each others sentences.  
他们再次交谈起来，一人接一人地完成彼此的句子。

"We are…" "我们…"

"…Israfel…Gendo made…" “…伊斯拉斐尔…源堂做了…”

"…us like this." "…像这样。"

There was a flash of light between them, as Shinji and Asuka looked on, the light subsided and now in front of them stood one single woman. Shinji once again spoke out this time barely able to speak.  
一道光芒在他们之间闪现，真嗣和明日香注视着，光芒消退后，他们面前站着一位女子。真嗣再次开口，这次几乎说不出话来。

"G…Gendo, my father?" "碇...碇司令，我的父亲？"

The woman in front of him smiled and spoke, still sounding like two people.  
他面前的女人微笑着说话，听起来仍然像两个人。

"Correct, we were Angel Project number seven."  
"没错，我们是第七号天使计划。"

There was a flash of light and the two nineteen year old twins stood in front of Shinji and Asuka again.  
一道光芒闪过，那对十九岁的双胞胎再次站在了真嗣和明日香面前。

"We were taken at the age of nineteen…"  
“我们在十九岁时被带走了……”

"…and altered by SEELE, we were…"  
“……并被 SEELE 改造了，我们曾是……”

"…altered to operate as one mind…"  
"…被改造以共享同一意识…"

"…and one body. Our purpose was…."  
"…以及同一躯体。我们的目的是…."

"…to succeed where our other Angel"  
"…在其他天使失败的地方取得成功…"

"….brethren have failed…"  
"……同胞们已失败……"

They spoke the final sentence together.  
他们齐声说出了最后一句话。

"To eliminate the Evangelion."  
"消灭使徒。"

"Evangelion?" "福音战士？"

"You don't even know? This should make it easier."  
"你连这都不知道？这下应该容易理解了。"

The word ran through Shinji's mind and then it hit him, on the day he passed out and Ayanami attacked Asuka that is what Ayanami had called him, she had called him Evangelion Unit 1.  
这个词在真嗣脑海中闪过，随即他恍然大悟，就在那天他昏倒而绫波攻击明日香的时候，绫波就是这么称呼他的，她称他为福音战士初号机。

"You mean us don't you? Ayanami was Zero, I am Unit One and Sohryu is Unit Two, am I right?"  
"你是说我们，对吧？绫波是零号机，我是初号机，而惣流是二号机，我说得对吗？"

"You finally understand, it's a shame it's too late. That knowledge could have saved you."  
"你终于明白了，可惜太迟了。那份知识本可以救你一命。"

The two women quickly dashed towards Shinji and Asuka, as they did so the two Agents immediately fired a shot simultaneously at them. A bright field appeared in front of the girls as the bullets rebounded off. Shinji felt a heavy force in his stomach as he was sent backwards by a kick from one of the girls. He looked over and saw Asuka also being sent backwards.  
两名女子迅速冲向真嗣和明日香，与此同时，两名特工立即同时向她们开枪。一道明亮的光盾出现在女孩们面前，子弹被反弹开来。真嗣感到腹部受到一股重击，被其中一名女孩踢得向后飞去。他转头一看，发现明日香也被踢得向后飞去。

Shinji looked up just in time to dodge a blow from the girl and tried to follow up with a knee to the stomach only to be thrown across the room by the force of the field the girl had brought up. He felt himself hit the wall and go straight through it due to the force, he lay their dazed for a moment, only to have to quickly dodge out the way when Asuka was also sent through the wall. She landed with a huge thud next to him and scrambled to her feet, through the hole in the wall Shinji noticed the two girls had reformed into one woman again and was just standing there.  
真嗣抬头及时躲过女孩的一击，试图用膝盖反击她的腹部，却被女孩升起的力场猛地甩到了房间的另一边。他感到自己撞上墙壁并直接穿了过去，躺在那里一时晕眩，紧接着又不得不迅速躲开，因为明日香也被甩过墙壁。她重重地落在他旁边，迅速爬起身，透过墙上的破洞，真嗣注意到两个女孩再次合二为一，站在那里。

"We need to think this one through."  
“我们需要仔细考虑一下。”

"They're able to operate as one mind and have full synchronization with each other, what one see's or feels the other seems to be able to. How do we defeat that?"  
"他们能够如同一体般运作，彼此间完全同步，一人所见所感，另一人似乎也能感知。我们该如何击败这样的存在？"

"They're in their single form at the moment, if we can somehow keep her like that we might have a chance, follow what I do."  
"她们目前处于单独形态，如果我们能设法让她保持这样，或许还有一线机会，照我做的去做。"

Shinji looked at her with confusion but nodded.  
真嗣困惑地看着她，但还是点了点头。

"I think fun time is over now, it's time to destroy you both."  
"我想欢乐时光已经结束了，现在该消灭你们两个了。"

Shinji turned to see Asuka had raised her gun at the woman, Shinji did the same and fired at the exact same time as Asuka. She moved around to the other side of the room as Shinji did the exact same. There was a flash of light and the woman split into two again, one going after Asuka and the other going after Shinji. Shinji saw the girl coming towards him and rolled out the way just as Asuka had done. They both stood with their backs to each other in the center of the room as Shinji quickly spoke to her.  
真嗣转身看到明日香已经举枪对准了那个女人，真嗣也同时举枪射击。她和真嗣同时移动到房间的另一侧。一道闪光过后，女人再次分裂成两个，一个追向明日香，另一个追向真嗣。真嗣看到女孩朝他冲来，便像明日香那样滚向一旁。两人背靠背站在房间中央，真嗣迅速对她说道。

"This dancing around is all well and good but what now?"  
"这种躲闪固然不错，但接下来怎么办？"

"Wait and see." "等着瞧吧。"

Asuka dived forward, Shinji followed suit. Both of the girls were now in the center of the room facing each other. Asuka quickly took her chance and fired a series of shots into the girls backs, Shinji followed suit. The bullets merely deflected from the field but each time Shinji noticed the bullets getting slightly closer to the girls. He caught Asuka's eye and she nodded towards him as they both reloaded their pistols. The girls once again moved towards them, only to have both Asuka and Shinji moved back through into Rei's Apartment. Shinji spoke quietly to her again.  
明日香向前一跃，真嗣紧随其后。两位女孩此时已站在房间中央，面对面站立。明日香迅速抓住机会，向女孩们的背部连开数枪，真嗣也跟着开火。子弹只是从力场弹开，但每次真嗣都注意到子弹离女孩们更近了一点。他捕捉到明日香的目光，她向他点头示意，两人同时重新装填手枪。女孩们再次向他们逼近，结果明日香和真嗣退回到绫波的公寓。真嗣再次轻声对她说道。

"Asuka, I don't think I understand what we're trying to do here."  
"明日香，我不太明白我们在这里要做什么。"

"You haven't been injured yet have you?"  
"你还没受伤吧？"

"No but…" "没有，但是……"

"I'll explain after we get out of this then, just keep doing what I do ok."  
"等我们逃出去后我再解释，现在就照我做的做，好吗？"

The two girls made their way back into Rei's apartment only to be met with quick knee's to the stomach from both Asuka and Shinji. The two of them staggered towards the center of the room and Asuka and Shinji quickly fired shots at them once again. One of Shinji's shots grazing one of the girls in the shoulder, there was a flash of light again as the two girls merged into the one woman. This time Asuka took her chance, she dived towards the woman knocking her to the ground and unloading the rest of her ammunition into the woman as she ran. She quickly got off and looked over towards Shinji who was staring at her in disbelief, Asuka panting, turned towards him and spoke.  
两个女孩回到丽家的公寓，却遭到明日香和真嗣迅速的膝击腹部。她们踉跄着向房间中央走去，明日香和真嗣再次向她们开火。真嗣的一枪擦过其中一个女孩的肩膀，光芒再次闪现，两个女孩合二为一成了一个女人。这次明日香抓住机会，扑向那女人将其击倒，并在奔跑中将剩余的子弹全部射入她体内。她迅速起身，看向真嗣，后者正难以置信地盯着她，明日香喘着气，转向他开口说道。

"You see, nice and easy, just like I said."  
“你看，简单轻松，就像我说的那样。”

Shinji sank to the floor and looked onwards at the dead woman lying on the ground, there was a faint glow around her as she once again split into the two nineteen year olds. Both lay there motionless, a pool of orange liquid trickling from the bullet wounds. Shinji let his gun fall to the floor as he looked from the bodies to Asuka who was also kneeling on the floor, once again transfixed on the doll she had shot earlier. He looked at her curiously and spoke.  
真嗣瘫坐在地上，凝视着躺在地上的女人尸体，她周围泛起微光，再次分裂成两个十九岁的少女。两人一动不动地躺在那里，弹孔中流出橙色的液体。真嗣任由枪支落地，目光从尸体转向同样跪在地上的明日香，她再次凝视着之前射中的玩偶。他好奇地看着她，开口说道。

"Asuka, are you alright?"  
“明日香，你还好吗？”

She turned to him, an angered expression on her face, but still speaking calmly.  
她转向他，脸上带着愤怒的表情，但语气依旧平静。

"I'm…fine let's get out of here and wait for Katsuragi to show up."  
“我……没事，我们离开这里，等桂木来了再说。”

A/N: Okay because I wasn't too happy with Chapter 10 I wanted to make it up to you all, so Chapter 11 is me doing just that. Hope you enjoyed it. Just on that note the way the twins spoke was indeed inspired by Unbreakable Bond by MBS which I would definitely recommend.  
作者的话：好吧，因为我不太满意第 10 章，我想弥补大家，所以第 11 章就是我这么做的。希望你们喜欢。顺便一提，双胞胎的说话方式确实受到了 MBS 的《不可破的羁绊》的启发，我绝对推荐这部作品。

### Chapter Discovery  

_8th June 2015 2015 年 6 月 8 日_

**NERV Offices – 0915 hours  
NERV 总部 – 上午 0915 时**

Three weeks had passed since Asuka and Shinji had come into contact with the twins that had called themselves Israfel. Most of that time had been spent with the Agents investigating the whereabouts of the twin's parents and what caused their home to be burnt down. Each day had been a frustrating cycle of going back and forth between locations, filing various reports and speaking to supposed witnesses, only to end up back where they started. After two weeks of this they both decided to drop the investigation, realizing they weren't going to get anywhere.  
自从明日香和真嗣接触到自称伊斯拉斐尔的双胞胎以来，已经过去了三周。这段时间大部分用于特工们调查双胞胎父母的下落以及他们家被烧毁的原因。每一天都是令人沮丧的循环，往返于各个地点，填写各种报告，与所谓的目击者交谈，最终却一无所获。两周后，他们俩决定放弃调查，意识到自己不会取得任何进展。

The investigation into the twins themselves was handled by someone else in NERV, Shinji and Asuka never heard another word about it, despite being the ones to track them down and eventually stop them. Of course they both heard nothing about the investigation, Shinji even wondered if there was an investigation or if they were just being told this to keep them quiet.  
对双胞胎本身的调查由 NERV 中的其他人接手，尽管是真嗣和明日香追踪并最终阻止了他们，但他们再也没有听到任何关于此事的消息。当然，他们俩对此一无所知，真嗣甚至怀疑是否真的有调查，或者这只是为了让他们保持沉默而编造的借口。

The situation regarding Shinji's father had also came to a halt since that day, Shinji had wanted to mention it but every time he was about to say something he stopped himself, not thinking it was worth it. He still wondered though, just what the girls meant that night when they told him it was his father who made them like that. He was wrapped up in this thought when he felt something blocking his way as he walked along. He stumbled backwards and looked up, only to see Asuka's eyes glaring death in his direction.  
自那天起，关于真嗣父亲的情况也陷入了停滞，真嗣本想提及此事，但每次话到嘴边，他都自我劝阻，觉得不值一提。尽管如此，他仍心存疑惑，那晚女孩们告诉他，是他的父亲让他们变成那样，这究竟意味着什么。他沉浸在这个念头中，行走间忽觉前方有物阻路。他踉跄后退，抬头一看，只见明日香的双眼正怒火中烧地瞪着他。

"Uhh, sorry." “呃，抱歉。”

"So you should be, watch where you're going next time, Ikari."  
“你确实该道歉，下次走路看着点，碇。”

"Sorry" “对不起”

"You've already said that once, where were you going anyway? You've already passed the office."  
“你已经说过一次了，你到底要去哪儿？你已经走过办公室了。”

Shinji turned and noticed that he was so wrapped up in his thoughts he had indeed walked right past the office. He turned to her and grinned slightly.  
真嗣转身发现，自己完全沉浸在思绪中，确实已经走过了办公室。他转向她，微微一笑。

"I was just walking." "我只是随便走走。"

"What, in a corridor of this size? Not really many places to wander to. Speaking of which, I want to ask you a few things when we actually get inside the office."  
"什么，在这条走廊里？地方不大，也没什么可逛的。话说回来，等我们真的进了办公室，我有几个问题想问你。"

She walked past him and he turned to follow her into the office. Once there, he took off his jacket and took a seat behind his desk. Asuka stood in the center of the room, her eyes following him as he sat. She immediately spoke when he sat, a mischievous smile on her face.  
她从他身边走过，他转身跟着她进了办公室。一进门，他就脱下外套，坐在办公桌后。明日香站在房间中央，目光随着他坐下而移动。他一坐下，她立刻开口，脸上带着调皮的微笑。

"Agent Ikari, you know this office we're in."  
"碇队长，你知道我们现在所在的这个办公室。"

He looked at her and nodded slightly.  
他看了她一眼，微微点头。

"Yes…" "是的……"

"Well I've been thinking, why is it the only one on the basement level and why is it there are three agents crammed into what looks like little more than a converted storeroom when we could be in one of the nicer ones on a higher level?"  
"我在想，为什么只有我们这个办公室在地下室，而且明明有三名特工挤在一个看起来不过是改装过的储藏室里，我们却不能搬到楼上那些更好的办公室去呢？"

Shinji took in her question and looked around the office, he had to admit that since Asuka and Rei had been assigned to work with him the office was looking a bit more crowded, especially considering Asuka wasn't the tidiest of workers and Misato was also coming in quite often.  
真嗣听了她的问题，环顾了一下办公室，他不得不承认，自从明日香和丽被分配来和他一起工作后，办公室显得有些拥挤了，尤其是考虑到明日香并不是最整洁的员工，而美里也经常来访。

"It's near to the unsolved case files?"  
"因为它靠近未解案件档案室？"

"Go on…" "继续…"

"And it…is a converted storeroom."  
"而且它…是一间改建的储藏室。"

"Converted by who?" "谁改建的？"

"Me…"

"Why would you do that? And don't tell me it's near to the unsolved case files because I'm not buying that explanation."  
"你为什么要那样做？别跟我说是因为靠近未解案件文件，我可不信那套解释。"

"It's…away from other people."  
"那里……远离人群。"

Shinji lowered his eyes as soon as he made the comment, awaiting some sort of verbal attack from Asuka, the attack he expected never came however as she merely nodded and went over to her own desk. Once there she spoke again.  
真嗣一说出那句话，就垂下了眼帘，等待着明日香可能的言语攻击。然而，预期的攻击并未到来，她只是点点头，走到自己的办公桌前，然后再次开口。

"Maybe we should think about putting in a request to move to a larger office though, and maybe one with a window."  
“也许我们应该考虑申请搬到一个更大的办公室，最好带个窗户。”

Shinji didn't respond, yet he actually thought about it, the idea was a good one, except if they did move he'd have to deal with the other Agents, the ones who, unlike Asuka and Rei, ridiculed him and would rather he just left NERV.  
真嗣没有回应，但他确实思考了这个提议。这个想法不错，只是如果他们真的搬走，他将不得不面对其他特工，那些不像明日香和绫波那样，而是嘲笑他、宁愿他离开 NERV 的人。

"Maybe…" "或许吧…"

"Oh come on, put some enthusiasm into it, surely dealing with a few people are worth it, at least we won't be sat in the darkness looking at blank walls anymore."  
"哦，拜托，加点热情进去，处理几个人肯定值得，至少我们不会再坐在黑暗中对着空白的墙壁了。"

"Maybe…" "或许吧…"

"Are you stuck in a loop again? Moved on from 'sorry' to maybe?"  
"你又陷入循环了吗？从‘对不起’转移到‘也许’了？"

He grinned and replied. 他咧嘴一笑，回答道。

"Maybe…I don't know, this room sort of has a charm to it."  
"也许……我不知道，这个房间有种特别的魅力。"

"What do you mean a charm to it? It's dull, it's dark, it's on the basement level and the coffee machine keeps breaking, I have to keep traveling up to the fourth floor for my hourly caffeine fix."  
"你说的魅力是什么意思？这里沉闷、昏暗，还在地下室，咖啡机老是坏，我得不断跑到四楼去满足我每小时的咖啡瘾。"

"Can't you just cut down on caffeine?"  
"你就不能少喝点咖啡吗？"

She looked up at him with a mock look of horror.  
她抬头看着他，脸上带着夸张的惊恐表情。

"Are you joking, that stuffs the reason I joined NERV. Excitement, adventure and all the coffee you can drink."  
“你在开玩笑吧，这些正是我加入 NERV 的原因。刺激、冒险，还有喝不完的咖啡。”

There was silence for a short while until she continued.  
短暂的沉默后，她继续说道。

"But seriously, Katsuragi isn't on this floor and we have to answer to her all the time. Anyway, it'd be more convenient for us and who cares what the others say about you or us, we're the ones who got the note of commendation from the director for our work on the Israfel case aren't we? Just because we're more open minded."  
"但说真的，葛城小姐不在这层楼，我们还得随时向她汇报。不管怎样，这对我们更方便，谁在乎别人怎么说你或我们，我们可是因为伊斯拉菲尔案件得到了主任的嘉奖，不是吗？就因为我们思想更开放。"

Shinji looked up in surprise, the last statement was one of the last things he'd have expected to hear from Asuka.  
真嗣惊讶地抬起头，最后那句话是他最没想到会从明日香嘴里听到的。

"You mean you believe in aliens and the paranormal now?"  
"你是说你现在相信外星人和超自然现象了？"

"Well…I didn't really say that now did I, but I will admit I've seen some things I can't explain between regenerating men, levitating mafia bosses and shape shifting twins, I admit there is more out there than what we know, maybe not Aliens but if it means a window I'll say I believe in it."  
"嗯……我确实没那么说过，对吧？但我得承认，我见过一些难以解释的事情，比如重生的男人、悬浮的黑帮老大和变形的双胞胎，我承认有些东西超出了我们的认知，也许不是外星人，但如果这意味着能有一扇窗，我会说我愿意相信它。"

"Is a window that important to you?"  
"一扇窗对你来说就那么重要吗？"

"When I was an agent in training I dreamt of an office with a big window"  
"在我还是一名特工学员时，我梦想着拥有一间带大窗户的办公室。"

"Really?" “真的吗？”

"Well…no not really, I actually dreamt of myself being hailed as being one of the best NERV Agents there is, but I'm sure my office then had a big window."  
"嗯…不，其实没有，我梦见自己被誉为最优秀的 NERV 特工之一，但我确信那时的办公室一定有一扇大窗户。"

They laughed at the comment for a bit, Shinji was about to respond when the phone on his desk rang. He placed his hand on the receiver and called over to Asuka.  
他们对这个评论笑了好一会儿，真嗣正要回应时，他桌上的电话响了。他把手放在听筒上，朝明日香喊道。

"Maybe we could buy one and place it in the middle or something, best of both worlds."  
"也许我们可以买一个放在中间什么的，两全其美。"

Shinji picked up the phone and almost immediately the other person began speaking, the voice however was not that of a normal person, it was slow speaking and mechanical.  
真嗣拿起电话，几乎立刻就听到了对方的声音，但那并不是普通人的声音，而是说话缓慢且机械。

"_Is that Agent Ikari?"_ “是碇探员吗？”

"Yes, who is this?" “是的，您是哪位？”

"_A friend, is Agent Sohryu with you?"_  
"朋友，是索留鲁特工和你在一起吗？"

Shinji glanced up at Asuka and replied.  
真嗣抬头看向明日香，回答道。

"Yes, she's here." "是的，她在这里。"

"_Good, I want you both to meet me at the café opposite the subway station near the NERV building. Come quickly."_  
"好，我要你们俩到 NERV 大楼附近地铁站对面的咖啡馆来见我。快点来。"

"Hold on a minute, who is this?"  
"等一下，你是谁？"

The line went dead as Shinji put the phone down. Asuka looked at him, expecting an explanation from him.  
电话那头沉默了，真嗣放下手机。明日香看着他，期待他给个解释。

"I don't know, but who ever it is wants us to meet them now."  
"我不知道，但无论对方是谁，他们希望我们现在就去见他们。"

"Did they say why?" "他们有说为什么吗？"

"No, they just said they were a friend."  
"没有，他们只说自己是朋友。"

"Do you think we should go?"  
"你觉得我们应该去吗？"

"I'm not sure, last time I got a strange call it turned out to be useful, the time before that you received one and it was useful. The third could be anyone though, we don't know if we can trust this person."  
"我不确定，上次我接到一个奇怪的电话，结果证明是有用的，再上次是你接到的，也很有用。但第三个就不好说了，我们不知道是否能信任这个人。"

"Well if we can't I guess two out of three ain't bad."  
"好吧，如果不行的话，我想两成三也不算差。"

**Tokyo-3 Central Café – 0930 hours  
东京-3 中央咖啡馆 —— 0930 时**

The two of them entered the café and looked around, it was completely empty save for the person behind the counter and a white haired man in a suit sitting at one of the tables. Shinji glanced over at him, he was smoking a cigarette and appeared to have some sort of small device attached to his head, near his eyes. Shinji recognized it straight away, a special ocular implant capable of, or as the adverts said, performing miracles. A special device reserved for the stupidly rich or for those of major importance, it didn't take Shinji long to realize just which category this person would have fell into. They both made their way over to him and Shinji spoke first.  
两人走进咖啡馆，环顾四周，除了柜台后的人和一个坐在桌旁的银发西装男子外，这里空无一人。真嗣瞥了他一眼，他正在抽着烟，头上似乎附着某种小型装置，靠近眼睛的位置。真嗣立刻认出那是一种特殊的视觉植入物，广告中称之为能创造奇迹的设备。这种装置通常只留给极其富有或极为重要的人物，真嗣很快意识到这个人属于哪一类。他们一起走向他，真嗣先开口了。

"You're the person who contacted us, aren't you?"  
“你就是联系我们的人，对吧？”

The man turned towards him and smiled slightly.  
那人转向他，微微一笑。

"Yes I am, sorry about the voice masking, there are many people however working against me who would have loved to track me down."  
“是的，抱歉用了变声，有很多人想追踪我，他们可不会放过这个机会。”

"I see, and just who are you?"  
“我明白了，那么你是谁？”

"A friend, please sit down, there is much I have to tell you both."  
"朋友，请坐，我有许多事情要告诉你们两位。"

The two agents sat on the opposite side of the table from the man and awaited him to speak again.  
两位特工坐在桌子对面，等待着那人再次开口。

"First off allow me to introduce myself, my name is Spender, C.G.B. Spender. I have been following your work let me tell you, what you have done so far has attracted a great deal of attention from my co workers. Some of it good and some bad, they're not sure what to make of either of you."  
"首先，请允许我自我介绍，我叫斯宾德，C.G.B. 斯宾德。我一直关注着你们的工作，你们迄今为止所做的一切引起了我的同事们极大的关注。其中有些是好的，有些则不然，他们不确定该如何看待你们两位。"

Asuka cut in. 明日香插话道。

"And just who is it you work for?"  
"你究竟是为谁工作的？"

"That I cannot reveal, all I can say is I work for a special committee linked to the Japanese government and NERV. By being here today I am risking a lot, I wanted to speak to you about the cases you have both been on recently."  
"这一点我无法透露，我只能说我是隶属于日本政府和 NERV 的一个特别委员会。今天能在这里见到你，我冒了很大的风险，我想和你谈谈你们最近处理的那些案件。"

Shinji looked him over, not sure of whether to trust the man or not.  
真嗣打量着他，不确定是否应该信任这个人。

"Go on…" "继续…"

"As you may have realized NERV has been covering up certain details of those cases to hide the truth from you both. The truth being the identity of the people you have been tracking down. Sachiel, Shamshel, Ramiel, Gaghiel, Israfel, I expect that you have noticed the links between them all?"  
"你可能已经意识到，NERV 一直在掩盖这些案件中的某些细节，以向你们隐瞒真相。这个真相就是你们一直在追踪的人的身份。萨基尔、沙姆谢尔、拉米尔、加吉尔、伊斯拉斐尔，我想你已经注意到了他们之间的联系？"

"The liquid known as LCL and the field of light they produce?"  
"那种被称为 LCL 的液体以及它们产生的光场？"

Spender looked at Asuka and smiled.  
斯宾塞看着明日香，微笑了。

"Correct Miss Sohryu, they are not any random people. They are the remnants of a project started long ago. A project that was started thirty years before the impact incident and was ended on the very same day of impact"  
“正确的，绫波小姐，他们不是随便的人。他们是多年前一个项目的遗留物。这个项目在冲击事件发生前三十年的那一天启动，也在冲击事件当天被终结。”

"What project?" “什么项目？”

"It goes under many names, the Angel project, Human Instrumentality Project. It was started by an organization called GEHIRN."  
"它有许多名称，天使计划，人类补完计划。由一个名为 GEHIRN 的组织发起。"

"What was the aim of the project?"  
"这个项目的目的是什么？"

"Genetic enhancement Ikari, to create a race of genetically enhanced super soldiers, if you will. The products of which were termed Angels, there were thirteen of these Angels created. You have already seen and taken out five."  
"基因增强，碇。旨在创造一支基因改良的超能士兵种族，如果你愿意这么理解的话。这些产物被称为天使，共制造了十三位。你已经见过并消灭了其中的五位。"

Shinji and Asuka glanced at each other and then back to Spender, waiting for him to speak again.  
真嗣和明日香互相对视了一眼，然后又转向斯宾德，等待他再次开口。

"The angels you see were not what GEHIRN expected and were out of control. Probably due to the test subjects, they were experimenting on criminals, the jobless, young children and anyone who wanted a quick bit of cash. NERV was aware of this and put together what is known as Project Evangelion. That is where you two and Ayanami come into it, you were their chosen three."  
“你们所见到的使徒并非 GEHIRN 所预期的那样，它们失控了。这可能是因为实验对象的问题，他们在对罪犯、无业游民、儿童以及任何想要快速赚钱的人进行实验。NERV 对此有所了解，并组建了所谓的‘福音计划’。这就是你们两个和绫波加入其中的原因，你们是被选中的三人。”

"Why us?" “为什么是我们？”

"They need people they can easily keep quiet, you Agent Ikari have quite the reputation among your coworkers and among mine. The only difference is my coworkers are frightened of you because you're the closest to the truth out of anyone. Agent Sohryu, not so long out of the academy and the skeptic, surely you must have thought it strange your first assignment was to someone who was little more then a joke between agents? No, it was no coincidence, you were chosen, just as Shinji was."  
"他们需要那些能轻易保持沉默的人，而你，碇一诚特工，在你的同事中以及我的同事中颇有名气。唯一的区别在于，我的同事们害怕你，因为你比任何人都更接近真相。绫波零特工，刚从学院毕业不久的怀疑论者，你肯定觉得奇怪，你的第一个任务竟然是派给一个在特工间不过是笑料的人？不，这不是巧合，你是被选中的，就像真嗣一样。"

Shinji swallowed hard and thought about Spender's words. He had been chosen to take out the angels just like Agent Sohryu had been because people were frightened of him? It was hard to believe, even for him, he looked up and responded.  
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，思考着斯宾德的话。他被选中去消灭天使，就像绫波零特工一样，是因为人们害怕他吗？即使对他来说，这也难以置信，他抬头回应道。

"What about my father, where does he come into this? He was there a few weeks ago when I ended up in that hospital. What does he have to do with this?"  
"那我父亲呢，他在这其中扮演什么角色？几周前我在那家医院时他也在场。他与此事有什么关系？"

"I had a feeling you'd be asking that question Shinji. I do not have all the answers for you but I will say your father is known to us. He was involved with GEHIRN and is also one of the people who put your name forward for the Evangelion project. Now if you'll excuse me I have to leave, my coworkers will be wondering where I am."  
"我早有预感你会问这个问题，真嗣。我并非无所不知，但可以告诉你，你父亲我们确实认识。他曾参与 GEHIRN 项目，也是推荐你加入 EVA 计划的人之一。现在请原谅，我得走了，同事们会奇怪我去哪儿了。"

Spender stood up and made his way out of the café, leaving Asuka sitting next to a shocked Shinji. Shinji felt his right hand clenching and unclenching nervously as Spender's words kept running through his minds. Not only had he been chosen but it was by his father. He heard Asuka speaking but it was distant to him.  
斯宾塞站起身，离开了咖啡馆，留下坐在震惊的真嗣旁边的明日香。真嗣感到自己的右手紧张地握紧又松开，斯宾塞的话不断在他脑海中回响。他不仅被选中，而且还是被自己的父亲选中的。他听到明日香在说话，但声音对他来说很遥远。

"Agent Ikari, are you alright?"  
"碇君，你还好吗？"

He felt his anger rising as he thought of it more, there was a burning sensation behind his eyes as he blinked away forming tears. Without thinking, he quickly stood up and immediately moved out of the café, Asuka following him quickly. They got outside and Asuka grabbed hold of his arm and swung him around to face her.  
他越想越气，眼中仿佛有股灼热感，泪水在眼眶中打转。未加思索，他迅速站起身，立刻离开了咖啡馆，明日香紧随其后。他们走到外面，明日香抓住他的手臂，猛地将他转过来面对自己。

"Agent Ikari, what's up with you?"  
“碇君，你怎么了？”

"Didn't you hear him, my father he's…he's been there all along, he's the reason for this. He abandoned me but he's been there all along, he's been watching me all along, even my job and work, it's all because of him."  
“你没听到吗，我父亲他……他一直都在，这一切都是因为他。他抛弃了我，却又一直在暗中观察我，包括我的工作和事业，全都是因为他。”

Asuka cut him off and responded quickly.  
明日香打断了他，迅速回应道。

"And think how I feel learning that everything I've done up until now has been scrutinized like a scientist studying a creature under a microscope. You're not the only one to learn something big today."  
"想想我的感受吧，得知我至今所做的一切都被像科学家在显微镜下研究生物一样仔细审视。你不是今天唯一学到重要事情的人。"

"I know…but…" "我知道……但是……"

"Look, despite what Spender just said, there's no proof of it. Everything he just said could have been a complete lie."  
"听着，尽管斯宾德刚刚那么说，但并没有证据。他刚才说的完全可能是彻头彻尾的谎言。"

"Then why was my father at that hospital that time then?"  
"那为什么我父亲那次会在那家医院呢？"

"I don't know, it could have been any reason."  
"我不知道，可能有各种原因。"

"I should have known all of this I've done would have been for nothing. I'm just some useless tool of my fathers to be discarded when the jobs complete."  
"我早该知道我所做的一切都将毫无意义。我只是父亲手中一个无用的工具，任务完成后就会被抛弃。"

"Stop talking like an idiot, just because he put your name forward for 'Project Evangelion' doesn't mean you're a tool of his. If he put your name forward he must have thought something of you right?"  
"别再说傻话了，他推荐你参与'福音计划'并不意味着你就是他的工具。如果他推荐了你，那他肯定对你有所期待，不是吗？"

Shinji didn't respond, instead he just looked down at the ground while Asuka kept on speaking, her anger rising up at the brown haired agent in front of her.  
真嗣没有回应，只是低头看着地面，而明日香继续说着，对面前这位棕发特工的愤怒愈发高涨。

"As far as I'm concerned everything we've done has been our work and under instructions from the director of NERV. Not Mr. Spender, not your father and not anyone else. I'm not going to let some story from an anonymous man with expensive implants and a smart suit get me to start questioning everything. If you want to believe everything and give up like an idiot then go ahead."  
"就我而言，我们所做的一切都是按照 NERV 指挥官的指示行事。不是斯宾德先生，不是你父亲，也不是其他任何人。我不会因为某个匿名男子带着昂贵的植入物和一身精明西装的故事就开始质疑一切。如果你想盲目相信并像个傻瓜一样放弃，那就请便吧。"

"Sorry." "对不起。"

"There you go with the apologizing again, you really don't realize how annoying that is do you?"  
"你又来了，老是道歉，你真的没意识到这有多烦人吗？"

"No, but what else am I meant to say?"  
"不，但我还能说什么呢？"

"I'll think of something, look lets just put aside what Mr. Spender has said for now. I'm not saying it isn't true but if it is there is nothing we can do at the moment but wait and see what happens. On that note we shouldn't tell anyone about this."  
"我会想出办法的，听着，我们先暂时放下斯宾德先生的话。我不是说那不是真的，但如果真是如此，我们现在能做的只有等待，看看会发生什么。就此而言，我们不应该告诉任何人这件事。"

"Right." “好的。”

**Unknown Location 未知地点**

Spender moved into the darkened room and headed straight for the head of the table, as he moved, the heads of the others already sitting turned as he moved past them. He took a seat at the end of the table and looked straight on at the shadowed faces of all the others in the room. The rest of the committee, as they were known, representatives from each of the worlds major powers, each one working in secrecy, hidden deep within their respective countries governments.  
斯宾德走进昏暗的房间，径直走向桌子的首位，随着他的移动，已经坐在那里的其他人纷纷转头看向他。他在桌子的一端坐下，直视着房间里所有其他阴影中的面孔。剩下的委员会成员，正如他们所知的，来自世界各大强国的代表，每个人都在秘密中工作，深藏于各自国家的政府之中。

As soon as Spender sat down one of the other members of the committee, an American turned to him and spoke.  
斯宾德一坐下，委员会的另一位成员，一个美国人，便转向他开口了。

"I'm sure you are aware of why we asked to have this committee meeting."  
“我相信你清楚我们为何要求召开这次委员会会议。”

Spender looked up smiling and nodded.  
斯宾德抬头微笑着点了点头。

"Yes I am aware." "是的，我知道。"

"Then you understand our concerns."  
"那么你理解我们的担忧。"

"Yes I understand, however there is no reason to be concerned. Please let it be known that my contact with Agent's Ikari and Sohryu was purely for the benefit of this committee."  
"是的，我理解，但完全没有理由担心。请让大家知道，我与碇和绫波的接触纯粹是为了这个委员会的利益。"

"Benefit? We delegated the handling of the Evangelion subjects to director Ikari, there is no reason for us to be involved."  
"好处？我们已将 EVA 实验体的处理工作委托给碇司令，没有理由让我们介入。"

"You are not thinking of the big picture, we placed Gendo Ikari in charge of ensuring the subjects were subjected to the Evangelion serum and making sure the instructions for the Angels was handed to the subjects. However Gendo Ikari has failed to gain his Agents trust, which means I had to step in."  
"你没有考虑大局，我们让碇源堂负责确保实验体接受 EVA 血清并传递给使徒的指令。然而，碇源堂未能赢得其特工的信任，这意味着我不得不介入。"

"In what way?" "以何种方式？"

"Agent Ikari is eventually going to find out it is his father who is pulling the strings and when that happens he is going to want nothing to do with his father, or perhaps NERV. If that happens we cannot rely on just Agent Sohryu to take down the rest of the Angels, despite her being our first choice, and we certainly cannot rely on Agent Ayanami either. We need Gendo's son on our side, that is why I met with him, to gain his trust."  
"最终，碇君会发现幕后操纵一切的是他的父亲，而一旦真相大白，他可能会彻底断绝与父亲乃至 NERV 的任何联系。如果这种情况发生，我们不能仅仅依赖赤木律子特工来击败剩余的使徒，尽管她是我们的首选，当然也不能指望绫波零特工。我们需要碇源堂的儿子站在我们这一边，这就是为什么我会去见他，为了赢得他的信任。"

"You also revealed the nature of the Angels to him."  
"你还向他透露了使徒的本质。"

"Yes I did, purely to gain his trust. We cannot rely on Gendo Ikari to finish this job, we must use other means. Nothing else has been revealed to Agents Ikari and Sohryu and what was revealed is not of any use to them anyway."  
"是的，纯粹是为了赢得他的信任。我们不能依赖碇源堂来完成这项任务，我们必须采取其他手段。对碇真嗣和赤木律子特工没有透露更多信息，而且已经透露的内容对他们来说也没有任何实际用途。"

"Do you think gaining their trust will aid us?"  
"你认为获得他们的信任会有助于我们吗？"

"Of course, trust is the most valuable resource on earth. If they trust us we can control them, even if they do not know it. Do not worry, as Chairman of this committee I only act within SEELE's best interests."  
"当然，信任是地球上最宝贵的资源。如果他们信任我们，我们就能控制他们，即使他们并不知情。别担心，作为这个委员会的主席，我只会为 SEELE 的最大利益行事。"

The rest of the committee murmured in agreement as Spender looked on, awaiting the American's next question.  
委员会的其他成员纷纷表示赞同，斯宾德则在一旁注视着，等待美国人的下一个问题。

"Understood, I'm sorry for doubting you Chairman Keel. I was just concerned that is all, we have waited too long to let our plans go to waste."  
“明白了，基尔议长，很抱歉我曾怀疑您。我只是有些担忧，仅此而已，我们已经等待太久，不能让计划付诸东流。”

"Your concerns are noted but not required, I am just ensuring we have a backup plan, should Director Ikari fail us."  
“你的担忧我已知晓，但并不必要，我只是确保我们有一个备用方案，以防碇司令让我们失望。”

_9th June 2015 2015 年 6 月 9 日_

**Directors Office – 1030 hours  
局长办公室 – 10:30**

"Agent Kaji welcome." “凯吉特工，欢迎。”

Kaji closed the door behind him and stepped into the darkened office, Kaji was surprised that any normal person could work in an environment like this, and then again Director Ikari wasn't what he'd call a normal man. He looked over behind Ikari and saw Deputy Director Fuyutsuki standing behind Gendo silently.  
凯吉关上身后的门，走进昏暗的办公室。他惊讶于普通人竟能在这样的环境中工作，但转念一想，碇局长可不是他口中的普通人。他环顾四周，看到副局冬月站在碇身后，沉默不语。

"Director Ikari, Deputy Director Fuyutsuki, we meet again."  
"碇司令，副司令冬月，我们又见面了。"

Fuyutsuki stepped forward into the light and spoke, a solemn look on his face.  
冬月向前一步，走进灯光下，脸上带着严肃的表情开口道。

"I only wish it was under better circumstances, what do you have to report?"  
"我只希望是在更好的情况下，你有什么要报告的？"

"Straight to business, huh?"  
"直奔主题，嗯？"

Kaji smiled and waited for a response, receiving none, he launched straight into his report.  
加治微笑着等待回应，未得到任何答复，他便直接开始了汇报。

"As you know, yesterday at nine fifteen hours Agent Shinji Ikari was contacted in his office from a caller asking to meet both he and Agent Sohryu in a café near the Tokyo-3 Central Subway Station. As you have both requested I followed both Agents and observed their meeting with the caller."  
"如您所知，昨天九点十五分时，特工碇真嗣在其办公室接到一个电话，对方要求与他和特工惣流在东京-3 中央地铁站附近的一家咖啡馆会面。鉴于两位特工的要求，我跟随了他们并观察了与来电者的会面。"

Fuyutsuki and Gendo looked at each other, Fuyutsuki spoke once again.  
冬月和源渡互相对视，冬月再次开口。

"What was their meeting about, Agent Kaji?"  
“他们的会议内容是什么，加持先生？”

"I am not certain, I would not have been able to get into the café without being sighted by either of them. The meeting however did seem to have an effect on both Agents and lasted some time."  
“我不确定，如果我不被他们中的任何一个发现，就无法进入那家咖啡馆。不过，这次会议似乎对两位特工都产生了影响，并且持续了相当长的时间。”

"In what way?" "以什么方式？"

"Shortly after the meeting took place and the person left, Agent Ikari promptly stood up and ran out of the café, only to be pursued by Agent Sohryu. They then had what seemed like a heated discussion outside of the café."  
"会议结束后不久，那人离开，碇参谋立刻起身冲出咖啡馆，随即被惣流参谋尾随。他们在咖啡馆外似乎进行了一场激烈的争论。"

"I see, and who was the person they met with?"  
"我明白了，他们见的那个人是谁？"

"This is the part that's going to shock you both, it certainly surprised me."  
"这就是会让你们俩都震惊的部分，它确实让我大吃一惊。"

Gendo interjected himself, at this point speaking in a harsh tone.  
碇源堂插话进来，此时语气变得严厉。

"Get to the point, Agent Kaji."  
"直说吧，加持先生。"

"Committee Chairman Keel."  
"基尔委员长。"

"I see, that is all Agent Kaji, you may now leave."  
"我明白了，就这样吧，梶探员，你可以离开了。"

"Yes, Director." "是，局长。"

Fuyutsuki watched as Kaji exited the room, when the door closed he turned to Gendo and spoke quietly.  
冬月看着加持离开房间，当门关上时，他转向碇源堂，轻声说道。

"It would seem the old man has an agenda."  
“看来那位老人有自己的打算。”

"Yes it does, this might impact our plans."  
“确实如此，这可能会影响我们的计划。”

"How so?" “怎么变了？”

"Keel is not stupid, he will want to control them and to gain their trust so he can use them for his own means, we cannot allow him to do that. We have our own agenda to carry out."  
"基尔并不愚蠢，他会想要控制他们并赢得他们的信任，以便为自己的目的所用，我们不能让他得逞。我们有我们自己的议程要执行。"

"Contacting the Agents though, the committee couldn't have been too pleased."  
"联系特工们，委员会肯定不会太高兴。"

"I wouldn't imagine so, then again Keel is a very persuasive man."  
"我想也是，不过话说回来，基尔是个非常有说服力的人。"

"So what should we do?"  
“那我们该怎么办？”

"Wait, we do not know what Keel told them and as far as he is concerned we are still working according to SEELE's scenario. We will observe for now and if need be then we will interfere. We cannot allow our own plans to be compromised because of one careless mistake."  
“等等，我们还不清楚基尔告诉了他们什么，就他而言，我们仍在按照 Seele 的剧本行事。我们先观察，必要时再介入。我们不能因为一个疏忽的错误而让我们的计划受影响。”

**Misato's Office – 1115 hours  
美里办公室 – 11 点 15 分**

Shinji & Misato were discussing all that has happened, despite him living back with Misato they have not had the time to discuss anything. Misato tried to get information out of them about what has happened but Shinji, as always, refused tell her anything, scared that if she knows it might endanger her.  
真嗣和美里正在讨论发生的一切，尽管他已搬回与美里同住，但他们一直没时间谈及任何事情。美里试图从他们那里获取信息，了解发生了什么，但真嗣一如既往地拒绝透露，担心她知道了可能会危及她。

Shinji paused for a moment before he knocked at the door, not entirely sure he wanted to go through with this. He could just turn around, go back to his office and pretend to do some paperwork, but then even if he did he'd have to face Misato on the night and she'd most likely berate him for not turning up now. Besides, he had been putting off this discussion with her for three weeks now.  
真嗣在敲门前停顿了一下，不太确定自己是否真的想这么做。他本可以转身回到办公室，假装处理一些文书工作，但即便如此，晚上还是得面对美里，她很可能会因为他现在没出现而责备他。况且，他已经推迟与她的这次讨论三周了。

'_She has a right to know what's happened, or at least most of it.'_  
'她有权知道发生了什么，或者至少大部分情况。'

He brought his hand up again and knocked on the door, he waited for a moment until he heard Misato's voice asking him to come in from inside the room. He opened the door and found her sat behind her desk, papers all over the desk and a cup of coffee in her hand. It always amazed him how Misato was able to work in such a messy environment, it had been a question he asked himself when he was fourteen and again now when he was twenty eight.  
他再次举手敲了敲门，等待片刻，直到听到美里从房间里传来的声音，让他进去。他推开门，发现她坐在办公桌后，桌上堆满了文件，手里还拿着一杯咖啡。美里能在如此杂乱的环境中工作，总是让他感到惊讶，这个问题在他十四岁时曾自问过，如今二十八岁的他再次思考。

She turned to him and smiled warmly, Shinji smiled back and took a seat near her desk. He glanced over the various documents on the desk, most of it just menial paperwork relating to the last case he and Asuka worked on and also any investigations since then. He didn't get a good chance to look at them as Misato began to speak.  
她转向他，温暖地微笑，真嗣也回以微笑，并在她的桌旁坐下。他瞥了一眼桌上的各种文件，大多是与他和明日香最近处理的案件相关的琐碎文书工作，以及之后的任何调查。他没机会仔细看，因为美里开始说话了。

"Shinji, it's good to see you."  
“真嗣，见到你真好。”

"Yeah, sorry I didn't get a chance to speak with you when you asked. I've been busy."  
"是啊，抱歉在你问的时候没机会跟你说话。我一直很忙。"

"It's alright I understand, we haven't really been able to talk at home either because we haven't been there much."  
"没关系，我理解，我们在家里也没怎么聊过，因为我们也经常不在家。"

"Yeah I know." "是啊，我知道。"

She looked at him, not quite sure of how to proceed, she had wanted to speak to him for sometime knowing how the news of his father affected him and wanted to help him. Now that she actually got to speak to him she didn't know what to say. It wasn't easy trying to speak to someone of his age about this sort of thing, if he was fourteen again she'd probably be able to say something. She decided just to stick to the basics for now.  
她看着他，不太确定该如何继续，她早就想和他谈谈，知道他父亲的消息对他影响很大，想帮助他。现在她真的有机会和他交谈了，却不知道该说什么。和这个年纪的人谈论这种事情并不容易，如果他还是十四岁，她或许还能说些什么。她决定暂时先保持基本的话题。

"So, how have you been?"  
“那么，你最近怎么样？”

"I'm alright." “我还好。”

He was lying, Misato could tell immediately, the tone in his voice gave it away every time. They sat in silence for a few moments until Misato asked another question.  
他在撒谎，美里立刻就听出来了，他的语气每次都暴露了这一点。他们沉默地坐了一会儿，直到美里提出了另一个问题。

"Shinji, why haven't I been informed about anything you and Agent Sohryu have been working on for the past few weeks?"  
“真嗣，为什么我和草薙特工过去几周的工作情况我一点都不知道？”

"What do you mean, you know about the cases don't you?"  
“你这是什么意思，你不是知道那些案件吗？”

"Yes I know but not from you. Ever since we picked up Asuka from the cruise ship you haven't told me anything. Everything I've been told has came from formal reports and word of mouth. Don't you trust me?"  
"是的，我知道，但不是从你这里。自从我们从游轮上接回明日香后，你什么都没告诉我。我所知道的一切都是从正式报告和口耳相传中得来的。你不信任我吗？"

Shinji lowered his head and spoke quietly.  
真嗣低下头，轻声说道。

"I do, I just…" "我信任你，只是……"

"I understand that you're going through a rough time because of finding out about your father but I want to help you. I want you to tell me about what's happening."  
"我理解你因为发现父亲的事情而经历了一段艰难时期，但我希望能帮助你。我想让你告诉我发生了什么。"

"I know that it's just, everything is happening so suddenly, I need to figure it out myself first."  
"我知道这很突然，一切发生得太快，我需要先自己理清楚。"

"Then let me help you, I want to help you sort things out. It's just I don't like having to find out about you from other people."  
"那让我帮你吧，我想帮你梳理清楚。只是我不喜欢从别人那里得知你的事情。"

"I'm sorry I just didn't want to get you involved yet."  
"对不起，我只是不想让你这么早卷进来。"

Shinji regretted the words the moment they left his lips, he quickly tried to correct himself when he noticed Misato looking hurt.  
真嗣话一出口就后悔了，他注意到美里受伤的表情后，急忙试图纠正自己的话。

"I didn't mean that, I just…didn't want to get you or Asuka involved. She only got involved because she said she owed it to me. You and Asuka are needed by NERV to do a good job, I'm not needed I'm just here because…"  
"我不是那个意思，我只是……不想让你或明日香卷进来。她之所以参与进来，是因为她说她欠我一个人情。你和明日香对 NERV 来说很重要，需要你们好好完成任务，我不被需要，我只是因为……"

"Shinji you know that's not true."  
"真嗣，你知道那不是真的。"

"It is though, NERV doesn't need people like me. I'm not risking anything you…"  
"但事实就是如此，NERV 不需要我这样的人。我没有什么可冒险的，你……"

She cut him off angrily and brought her hand down on the table, startling Shinji.  
她生气地打断了他，猛地一掌拍在桌上，吓了真嗣一跳。

"Stop talking like that, if you honestly think that then hand in your resignation now because I don't want to have an Agent who thinks like that reporting to me. I'm not going to stop you Shinji but if you do leave keep in mind what you're leaving behind. You are needed by NERV whether you think it or not, if you weren't needed why would you be the one getting commended for bringing down those twins, why would you be the one chosen to take out Ramiel."  
"别再说那种话了，如果你真的这么认为，那就现在递交辞呈吧，因为我不想有一个这样想法的特工向我汇报。我不会阻止你，真嗣，但如果你真的离开，记住你将放弃的是什么。NERV 需要你，不管你信不信，如果不需要你，为什么是你被表扬击落那对双胞胎，为什么是你被选中去对付雷米尔。"

Shinji stood up and found himself shouting back at her.  
真嗣站起身来，发现自己对着她大喊。

"Because my father chose me to do it, because he had a use for me!"  
"因为我父亲选了我去做，因为他对我有所利用！"

The words slipped out so easily he fell back into his chair, his head buried between his hands as Misato looked at him sympathetically. She slowly stood up and put her arm around the young man, trying to console him. She whispered in his ear.  
话就这么轻易地脱口而出，他跌坐在椅子上，双手掩面。美里同情地看着他。她缓缓站起身，搂住这个年轻人，试图安慰他。她在他的耳边低语。

"What do you mean he had a use for you?"  
“你说的‘他对你有利用价值’是什么意思？”

"He…Me and Asuka were contacted by someone yesterday, he said he had been following the cases and he knew about my father being at the hospital. He called the people we have been against 'Angels' and said it was my fathers doing that I was chosen to take out Ramiel and also that I was given the other cases. Everything I've been doing, thinking I've been getting nearer to the truth is just bullshit planted by him to make me believe I was doing something worthwhile."  
“他……昨天我和明日香被一个人联系了，他说他一直在关注这些案件，并且知道我父亲在医院的事。他称我们对抗的那些人为‘天使’，并说是我父亲的原因，我才被选中去消灭雷米尔，还有其他案件也是。我一直以来所做的，以为自己越来越接近真相，其实都只是他设下的圈套，让我相信自己在做有意义的事。”

"Shinji…did you actually believe this person who contacted you?"  
"真嗣…你真的相信那个联系你的人吗？"

"Not at first but he knew, Misato, about each of the cases, he knew the names and the people involved. He knew about my father being at the hospital, he knew it all."  
"一开始没有，但他知道，美里，关于每一个案件，他知道名字和涉及的人。他知道我父亲在医院，他全都知道。"

"Was Agent Sohryu with you?"  
"惣流特工和你在一起吗？"

"Yes she was." "是的，她是。"

"And what did she say?"  
"她说了什么？"

"She told me to not believe what was said."  
"她告诉我不要相信那些话。"

"Then that's what you should do."  
"那就这么做吧。"

Shinji was about to speak again but Misato placed her finger across his lips, silencing him, and spoke again.  
真嗣正要再次开口，但美里将手指放在他的唇上，让他安静下来，然后又说道。

"Shinji, listen to Agent Sohryu and forget about it for now and focus on what you can prove. Work on finding out what you can and forget about whether or not your father chose you to do those tasks because it just sounds like someone trying to throw you off."  
"真嗣，听草薙特工的，暂时忘掉这件事，专注于你能证明的东西。努力查明你能查到的，别去想你父亲是否选择你来做这些任务，听起来就像有人在试图分散你的注意力。"

"I can't just forget about it though, he's involved, Misato, I know he is, I just can't prove it."  
"可我就是没法忘记这件事，他牵涉其中，美里，我知道他有份，只是我无法证明。"

"Maybe he is involved but it's been you who's done everything up to this point, your father didn't tell you to investigate Sachiel did he?"  
"或许他确实有牵连，但一直以来都是你在做所有的事，你父亲并没有让你去调查萨基尔，对吧？"

"No…"

"He didn't tell you or Agent Sohryu what to do, or control you during any of the other cases did he?"  
"他没有告诉你或苏里鲁特工该怎么做，也没有在其他案件中控制过你们，对吧？"

"No…"

"No, it's been you, if he chose you to do a task then it must show he has faith in you in some way, but I can't see how he could have done, he's not a part of NERV. You can't just think you're worthless because of what one person said."  
"不，如果是他选择你来执行任务，那一定说明他在某种程度上信任你，但我看不出他是怎么做到的，他不是 NERV 的一员。你不能因为一个人的话就觉得自己毫无价值。"

He looked up at her and smiled slightly as she lifted her arm from his shoulder, he spoke quietly.  
他抬头看着她，当她从他肩膀上抬起手臂时，他微微一笑，轻声说道。

"Maybe you're right." "也许你是对的。"

She hugged him and then returned to her seat.  
她拥抱了他，然后回到自己的座位上。

"I am, now that we've established that I have something for you and Sohryu to work on."  
“我现在就给你和苏里玉准备点东西。”

"What is it?" “怎么了？”

**Main Office – 1115 hours  
主办公室 – 11 点 15 分**

Asuka sat at her desk looking around the now devoid of life office, she looked up and spotted a small fly hovering around the light and watched it for a few moments before returning to staring blankly at the opposite end of the office. The hum of the three computers was beginning to drive her insane, she couldn't understand how Shinji could have spent so much time working down here on his own.  
明日香坐在她的办公桌前，环顾着如今空无一人的办公室。她抬头发现一只小苍蝇在灯光周围盘旋，便注视了片刻，随后又茫然地望向办公室的另一端。三台电脑的嗡嗡声开始让她发疯，她无法理解真嗣怎么能独自在这里工作这么久。

'_We definitely need a new office, this is so boring.'_  
'我们绝对需要一间新办公室，这里太无聊了。'

The door to the office began to open and Asuka found herself eager to talk to whoever was about to step through, just to alleviate some of the boredom. Much to her annoyance however the person to step through was the person she would have least liked to speak to at that moment in time. She watched on as Ayanami walked into the office and moved over to her desk, not even glancing in Asuka's direction.  
办公室的门开始打开，明日香发现自己渴望与即将进来的人交谈，只是为了缓解一些无聊。然而，令她恼火的是，走进来的人正是她此刻最不想交谈的人。她看着绫波走进办公室，走到自己的桌前，甚至没有朝明日香的方向瞥一眼。

"Welcome back." "欢迎回来。"

"Thank you." "谢谢你。"

The room fell into silence again, however this time it was accompanied by the sound of Rei using her computer. A few more moments passed until, much to Asuka's surprise, Rei began to speak.  
房间再次陷入沉默，然而这一次伴随着丽使用电脑的声音。又过了一会儿，令明日香惊讶的是，丽开始说话了。

"Agent Sohryu." "草薙少尉。"

"Mmmh." "嗯……"

Asuka looked across to Rei and found her looking over towards the door, seemingly struggling with whatever it was she wanted to say. Asuka sighed and replied again in an annoyed tone.  
明日香看向丽，发现她正望向门口，似乎在努力斟酌着要说什么。明日香叹了口气，再次用不耐烦的语气回答。

"Yes, what is it?" "是，有什么事吗？"

A few more moments passed until Rei eventually turned to Asuka and spoke softly, seemingly finding it difficult to get her words out.  
又过了一会儿，丽终于转向明日香，轻声开口，似乎很难说出话来。

"I would…like to apologize for what happened when I attacked you. I didn't intend to hurt you and I am sorry for it."  
“我……想为攻击你时发生的事道歉。我无意伤害你，对此我感到抱歉。”

Asuka's jaw nearly dropped as she stared back at her, it was the last thing she had expected from her. What surprised Asuka the most however was the difficulty Rei seemingly had to just apologize, it was almost as if the concept was foreign to her. This time Asuka found herself at a loss for what to say, despite the apology she still harbored some feelings of resentment towards her. She wanted to stand up and shout at her, yet at the same time couldn't help but feel some sort of pity for her.  
明日香瞪大了眼睛，几乎不敢相信自己的耳朵，这是她最意想不到的。然而，最让明日香惊讶的是丽道歉时的困难，这几乎像是她对道歉的概念感到陌生。这一次，明日香发现自己不知该说什么，尽管收到了道歉，她仍对丽怀有一些怨恨。她想站起来对她大喊，但同时又忍不住对她产生了一丝同情。

"Thanks, but don't think that makes up for it, I still don't true you."  
"谢谢，但别以为这就弥补了，我还是不信任你。"

"I understand." "我明白了。"

"Good, how are you feeling now anyway?"  
"那就好，你现在感觉怎么样？"

"I am alright now, I cannot carry out any field work yet but I have been allowed to return here."  
"我现在还好，还不能执行外勤任务，但已经获准回到这里了。"

"I see, what about your apartment."  
"我明白了，那你的公寓呢？"

"I will have to find a new place to live, for now I have been allowed to stay on the ward I was on."  
"我得找个新住处，目前我被允许暂时留在原来的病房里。"

"You mean you don't have anywhere else to stay, you can't stay at a friend's or relatives?"  
"你是说你没有其他地方可住，不能去朋友或亲戚家暂住吗？"

"I do not have any relatives."  
"我没有亲戚。"

"What about at a friends place?"  
"那朋友家呢？"

"I do not…" "我没有……"

Rei trailed off there, her expression saddened, Asuka looked on, not entirely sure of how to approach her. She turned to her screen and absently mindedly began to type anything, but the thought of what Rei had just said, or nearly said, was running around at the back of her mind.  
丽说到这里停了下来，表情显得有些悲伤，明日香看着她，不太确定该如何接近。她转向屏幕，心不在焉地开始打字，但丽刚刚说的话，或者说差点说出口的话，却在她脑海中挥之不去。

"Ayanami, if you want you can stay at mine. I can only offer you the sofa downstairs but it's better then being stuck in a hospital ward."  
“绫波，如果你想的话可以住在我这里。我只能提供楼下的沙发，但总比困在医院病房里好。”

Rei looked up at her and smiled slightly.  
绫波抬头看着她，微微一笑。

"I…would like that." "我……愿意那样。"

Asuka smiled back, her previous feelings for the woman seemingly going, she still felt she couldn't trust Rei but at the same time hated the idea that Rei had nothing but herself in the world. The words Shinji spoke a few weeks ago echoed in her mind, that Rei said NERV was all she had.  
明日香回以微笑，对这位女性的先前感觉似乎消失了，她仍然觉得无法信任绫波，但同时又讨厌绫波在这个世界上除了自己一无所有的想法。几周前真嗣说的话在她脑海中回响，绫波曾说 NERV 是她的一切。

'_Maybe now I'll be able to learn more about her.'_  
'也许现在我能更多地了解她了。'

Her train of thought was suddenly interrupted when the door to the office burst open and Shinji quickly made his way in. He put on his jacket and looked over towards Asuka.  
她的思绪突然被办公室门的猛然打开打断，真嗣迅速走了进来。他穿上外套，转头看向明日香。

"There's been an incident at the Central Subway Station, Katsuragi want's us to check it out."  
中央地铁站发生了事故，葛城让我们去查看一下。

"What's happened?" 发生了什么事？

"Someone went insane in one of the subway cars, killed three people. The guards there said he was leaking some sort of orange liquid."  
"有人在地铁车厢里发疯了，杀了三个人。那里的警卫说他身上流出了一种橙色的液体。"

"LCL?" "LCL？"

"We don't know yet, but Katsuragi wants us there as soon as possible. The police have tried searching the tunnels but had no luck so they handed it over to NERV."  
"我们还不确定，但葛城美里希望我们尽快过去。警方已经尝试搜索隧道但没有结果，所以他们把案件转交给了 NERV。"

"As usual." "一如既往。"

"Ayanami, Katsuragi told me to tell you that she wants to speak to you about getting a permanent assignment to this section."  
"绫波，葛城让我转告你，她想和你谈谈关于永久分配到这个部门的事。"

"I see." “我明白了。”

He looked over towards Asuka who was now just starting to stand up and put her own jacket on, he was about to make his way out of the office when Asuka called him back.  
他朝阿斯卡那边望去，她刚站起身开始穿自己的夹克。他正要走出办公室，阿斯卡叫住了他。

"Hold on there Ikari, no need to seem to enthusiastic. Besides, I've got the car keys."  
"等等，碇，不用表现得那么兴奋。再说了，车钥匙在我这儿。"

"Sorry." "对不起。"

She pulled her pistol out of the drawer and loaded it then promptly holstered it in her jacket.  
她从抽屉里拿出手枪，装上子弹，然后迅速将其插回夹克里的枪套。

"Right, let's go." "好，我们走吧。"

**Subway Station – 1230 hours  
地铁站 —— 12 时 30 分**

Shinji and Asuka made their way onto the main platform to find it deserted, save for a small number of police officers and Misato. Both he and Asuka made their way under the police tape and over towards Misato. When they arrived she looked at them both with a grave expression.  
真嗣和明日香走进主站台，发现这里空无一人，除了几名警察和美里。他们俩穿过警戒线，向美里走去。到达时，美里带着严肃的表情看着他们。

"It's not good news, the number of dead bodies they gave us at NERV has increased. We're looking at maybe twelve dead and the officers they sent after the person haven't returned yet."  
“这不是好消息，NERV 给我们的死亡人数增加了。我们可能要面对十二名死者，而且他们派去追捕凶手的警官们至今未归。”

Shinji looked at the tracks and to the officers moving away.  
真嗣看着轨道和逐渐远去的警官们。

"What happened exactly?" “到底发生了什么？”

"They're not sure, apparently the person in the front carriage began to flip out, he attacked three people then moved into the driver's compartment. The train itself is a little way up the line but it's completely came off the tracks, whatever he did it had some force to it."  
“他们也不确定，据说前车厢的那个人突然发狂，袭击了三个人，然后闯进了驾驶室。列车本身已经偏离轨道一段距离了，但完全脱轨了，无论他做了什么，都相当有破坏力。”

"I see, where are the survivors?"  
"我明白了，幸存者在哪里？"

"Most have been taken to hospital or taken away by the police before we got here."  
"大多数在我们到达之前已经被送往医院或被警方带走了。"

"Do we know anything about the person?"  
"关于那个人，我们有什么了解吗？"

"Nothing, anyone the police have spoken to have no idea who he was, they said he just started going insane, he was quiet one moment and then the next thing they knew he had killed someone and just kept going. The police have sent two officers down to the scene, but they lost communication."  
"没有任何线索，警方询问过的所有人都不知道他是谁，他们说他突然就疯了，前一刻还安静，下一秒就杀了人，然后继续行凶。警方派了两名警官到现场，但他们失去了联系。"

Asuka looked down the tracks into the darkness and then back to Misato.  
明日香沿着轨道望向黑暗深处，然后回头看向美里。

"So they passed it onto us?"  
"所以他们把这事交给了我们？"

"Yes, we're to go down to the scene of the crash taking monitoring equipment with us. We need to scout it out before they send rescue teams down."  
"是的，我们要带着监测设备前往坠机现场。在救援队下去之前，我们需要先勘察一番。"

"You mean there are still people in there?"  
"你是说里面还有人？"

"They're not sure, the survivors they did find made their own way back."  
"他们不确定，找到的幸存者是自己设法回来的。"

Just at that moment one of the police officers leading the investigation called over from the tracks.  
就在那一刻，负责调查的一位警官从轨道那边喊了过来。

"Agent Katsuragi, they're ready to send you and your agents down now."  
“葛城警官，他们现在可以送你和你的探员下去了。”

"Okay, we'll be right there."  
“好的，我们马上过去。”

All three of them made their way over towards the officers and lowered themselves onto the tracks. When they were on the tracks the officer and staff member handed them three helmets, each with a light attached and what appeared to be a recording device. They each put one of the helmets on and looked down towards the darkened tunnel.  
三人一同走向警官们，蹲下身来踏上轨道。当他们站稳后，警官和工作人员递给他们三顶头盔，每顶都配有灯光和一个看似录音的装置。他们各自戴上头盔，目光投向那幽暗的隧道深处。

"Right then, I guess we're going."  
“那么，我们出发吧。”

Asuka looked across at Shinji and smiled slightly.  
明日香转头看向真嗣，微微一笑。

"What's wrong, you're not afraid of the dark are you?"  
"怎么了，你不会是怕黑吧？"

"No nothing like that…let's go then."  
"不，不是那样的……那我们走吧。"

He began walked towards the tunnel, Misato following him, Asuka watched them both disappearing into the darkness and quickly followed. They walked up the line for about ten minutes until a strange smell hit Asuka's nose. She paused and spoke, her voice echoing through the dark tunnel.  
他开始向隧道走去，美里跟在他后面，明日香看着他们消失在黑暗中，迅速跟了上去。他们沿着线路走了大约十分钟，直到一种奇怪的气味触动了明日香的鼻子。她停下脚步，开口说道，她的声音在黑暗的隧道中回荡。

"Hold on, do you guys smell that?"  
"等等，你们闻到那个味道了吗？"

Shinji stopped and turned towards her, the light from his helmet hitting her right in the eyes. Before she had a chance to shout at him he replied.  
真嗣停下脚步，转向她，头盔的光线正好直射进她的眼睛。在她有机会对他大喊之前，他回答道。

"Yeah, it's almost like…"  
"是啊，这味道几乎像是……"

"Blood." "血。"

Both Asuka and Shinji were surprised to see Misato had also stopped and it was her who responded. She didn't give them any chance to reply as she immediately kept walking.  
明日香和真嗣都惊讶地发现美里也停下了脚步，并且是她回应了他们。她没有给他们任何回复的机会，立刻继续前行。

"I think I can see the train up ahead, let's get going."  
"我想我可以看到前面的火车了，我们走吧。"

They continued to walk until they eventually reached their destination, the train had come off the rails and was now blocking most of the tunnel. The front carriage had been turned on its side and flickering lights could be seen inside. Shinji climbed into the carriage and looked around, his torchlight providing little illumination. Behind him he felt Asuka dropping into the carriage along with Misato. The smell of blood was stronger in this section. Shinji looked around and noticed several dead bodies scattered around, blood staining their bodies and the areas around them. Whatever had done this couldn't have been human.  
他们继续前行，最终抵达了目的地，火车已脱轨，横亘在隧道中，大部分通道被阻塞。前方的车厢侧翻在地，内部闪烁着灯光。真嗣爬进车厢，环顾四周，手电筒的光线显得微弱。他感觉到身后的明日香和美里也跳进了车厢。这一区域的血腥味更加浓烈。真嗣环视四周，发现几具尸体散落各处，血迹斑斑，染红了他们的身体和周围区域。造成这一切的，绝不可能是人类。

"The smell is coming from further on down the line, there's a trail of LCL leading up the carriage and out as well."  
“气味是从前面传来的，有一条 LCL 的痕迹顺着车厢延伸出去。”

"Do you think that's where the missing officers went?"  
“你觉得失踪的警官们会去那里吗？”

"Maybe, I'm going to go check it out."  
"也许，我去看看。"

Asuka was about to climb out of the carriage and move further up when Shinji called her.  
明日香正要爬出车厢继续前行，这时真嗣叫住了她。

"Agent Sohryu…" "惣流特工……"

"Yes." "是的。"

"Be careful." "小心点。"

"Of course." “当然可以。”

Shinji watched as she climbed out and moved away from the carriage, he turned and came face to face with Misato.  
真嗣看着她爬出车厢并远离，他转身便与美里面对面。

"You're concerned about her aren't you?"  
“你很担心她，对吧？”

"Of course I am, she's a good…I like..."  
“当然，她是个好……我喜欢……”

In the faint light Shinji could have sworn he had seen Misato start to grin.  
在微弱的光线下，真嗣几乎可以发誓他看到美里开始露出笑容。

"Never mind, we have more important things to worry about at the moment, we'd better call them back and tell them it's safe for the rescue teams."  
“没关系，我们现在有更重要的事情要担心，最好把他们叫回来，告诉他们救援队可以安全行动了。”

"Good idea, I'll radio in. You go and make sure Asuka is safe."  
“好主意，我来联络。你去确保明日香的安全。”

"What about you?" "那你呢？"

"I'll be fine, Asuka needs you more than I do at the moment, especially if that person is down there."  
"我会没事的，现在 Asuka 比我更需要你，特别是如果那个人在下面的话。"

Shinji nodded and smiled at Misato.  
真嗣点点头，对美里笑了笑。

"Thanks." "谢谢。"

**Subway Tunnels – 1245 hours  
地铁隧道 —— 1245 小时**

As Asuka walked down, the smell of the LCL was getting stronger and stronger, she turned a corner and saw a section of wall illuminated by a flashlight. She kneeled down besides it and examined it slightly, the handle was covered with LCL.  
随着明日香走下隧道，LCL 的气味越来越浓，她转过一个弯，看到一堵墙被手电筒照亮。她跪在旁边仔细检查，把手被 LCL 覆盖。

'_Must have belonged to one of the officers sent down, that means our guy must be close.'_  
'一定是之前派下来的某位官员的，这意味着我们找的人应该就在附近。'

She looked around the area and noticed a small crawlspace next to her, just where the flashlight was pointed. She edged nearer and as she did so became ever more aware of a presence near her, quickly without thinking she span round and pointed her gun at the person nearing her. She breathed a sigh of relief to see it was Shinji.  
她环顾四周，注意到身边有一个小洞穴，正好在手电筒的光束所指之处。她慢慢靠近，同时越来越感觉到附近有人的存在，未经多想便迅速转身，将枪口对准了接近她的人。看到是真嗣，她松了一口气。

"Ikari, can you not do that again."  
“碇，你能不能别再这样了。”

"Sorry, Misato sent me, she radioed the rescue team to examine what's left of that train carriage. What have you found?"  
“抱歉，美里让我来的，她用无线电通知了救援队来检查那节火车车厢的残骸。你发现了什么？”

"What I'd assume to be one of the officers torches and a crawlspace here. I had a quick look before you snuck up on me and it looks like it leads to a room."  
"我想这应该是警官们的火把和这里的爬行空间。在你偷偷靠近我之前，我快速看了一眼，看起来它通向一个房间。"

"A room, that's impossible we had a look at the layout there's nothing here, there's no reason for it to be here."  
"一个房间？这不可能，我们看过布局图，这里什么都没有，没有理由会有房间。"

"Say's he who believes in aliens?"  
"说这话的人还相信外星人呢？"

"That's different, look it's not that I don't believe you. I mean the room is there in front of us, it just seems strange that it's not on the layout."  
"那不一样，你看，我不是不相信你。我的意思是，房间就在我们面前，只是它不在布局图上显得很奇怪。"

"Well no matter what the layouts say I'm looking inside, stay out here just in case our guy decides to come back."  
"不管布局图怎么说，我都要进去看看，你在外面待着，以防那家伙回来。"

"Yes sir." "是的，长官。"

Shinji mock saluted which got nothing more than a scowl from Asuka, she kneeled down again and looked around inside the crawlspace. Slowly she climbed inside and began moving into the room on the other side. She stood up and cautiously looked around, the smell of LCL was even stronger in here, it took her only a matter of seconds to realize why. Covering the entire back of the room was a huge tank filled seemingly to the brim with LCL. Along each wall were pipes and in the corner a machine that appeared to be connected to the LCL tank. She stepped forward and looked closer at the tank, as she did so she turned and shouted back to Shinji.  
真嗣模仿敬礼的动作，却只换来明日香的一个白眼。她再次跪下，朝爬行空间内张望。她慢慢地爬进去，开始向另一边的房间移动。她站起身来，小心翼翼地环顾四周，LCL 的气味在这里更加浓烈，她很快就明白了原因。整个房间的后部是一个巨大的水箱，里面似乎装满了 LCL。每面墙上都有管道，角落里有一台看起来与 LCL 水箱相连的机器。她向前迈了一步，更仔细地观察水箱，同时转身向真嗣喊道。

"There's a tank of that LCL stuff in here, it's almost like something out of a sci-fi movie, you know a growth chamber or something."  
"这里有一个装着那种 LCL 液体的罐子，简直像是科幻电影里的东西，你知道的，像是生长舱之类的。"

"Anything else in there?"  
"还有别的吗？"

"No just pipes and..." "没有，只有管道和……"

She trailed off as she turned back to look inside the tank, she could have sworn she saw something moving. She looked again, before she had a chance to finish off she felt a huge force sending her flying back into the wall. Shards of glass from the tank flew everywhere. The stench of blood rushed over her as she was covered in LCL. She slowly looked up, resisting the urge to vomit, as she did so she saw the figure in front of her.  
她话音未落，转身再次向水槽内望去，她发誓看到了什么东西在动。她又看了一眼，还没来得及说完，一股巨大的力量将她猛地击飞，撞在墙上。水槽的玻璃碎片四散飞溅。血腥味扑鼻而来，她被 LCL 液体覆盖全身。她缓缓抬头，强忍着呕吐的冲动，就在这时，她看到了眼前的身影。

'_It's not…that's not human anymore'_  
'那不再是……那不再是人类了'

The beast stood in front of her covered from head to toe in some sort of grey cracked armour, Asuka could see sections of it where human skin remained. The face of the being was no longer that of a human but was now grotesquely distorted, where there was once a mouth there was only grey, where there were once eyes now remained two sockets. She raised her gun at the thing and fired two shots only to see them bounce off of its body. From behind her she could hear Shinji shouting.  
那怪物站在她面前，从头到脚覆盖着一层灰色的裂纹盔甲，明日香能看到一些地方还残留着人类的皮肤。那生物的脸已不再是人类的面孔，而是变得畸形扭曲，原本是嘴巴的地方只剩灰色，原本是眼睛的地方现在只剩下两个空洞。她举枪对准那东西连开两枪，却只见子弹从其身上弹开。她身后传来了真嗣的喊声。

"Sohryu are you alright in there?"  
"Sohryu，你还好吗？"

"I found our suspect, he's been trans…"  
"我找到嫌疑人了，他已经被……"

She quickly ducked out of the way as the beast came towards her, she was able to get out of the way in time but it caught her arm. Almost immediately she screamed out in pain as she felt its skin graze her. Asuka raised her arm and looked at the wound, it was a mixture of a burn would and almost as if she had been cut at the same time. She raised her gun again, this time aiming for the section not covered by the armor and shot two more bullets. The monster stepped back seemingly in pain but then paused, its grotesque head tilted slightly and staring directly at Asuka. She watched as where she had shot was now replaced by the same grey armour.  
当怪物向她扑来时，她迅速闪避，虽然及时躲开了，但手臂还是被擦伤了。她立刻感到一阵剧痛，尖叫出声。明日香抬起手臂查看伤口，那是一种烧伤与割伤混合的伤痕。她再次举起枪，这次瞄准了未被盔甲覆盖的部分，连开两枪。怪物似乎因疼痛而退缩，但随即停下，它那丑陋的头颅微微倾斜，直直地盯着明日香。她看到刚才射击的地方，现在已经被同样的灰色盔甲覆盖了。

'_This is ridiculous how am I mean to stop something that's invincible.'_  
'这太荒谬了，我怎么可能阻止一个无敌的东西？'

Asuka fired her remaining bullets at the monster only to see them bounce off again, she quickly ran up to it and tried to punch it only to have her attack blocked and for her to be overcome by the same blinding pain she had felt when it charged at her. She felt it grab her and throw her towards the tank, as she landed she felt shards of glass enter her back. The being began to make its way over towards her when the sound of gunfire ran out across the room again, both her and the monster turned to the source to see Shinji stood there, his gun aimed directly at it.  
明日香向怪物射出剩余的子弹，却只见它们再次弹开，她迅速冲上前试图用拳头攻击，却遭到阻挡，并再次感受到那股令她目眩的剧痛。她感觉到它抓住她，将她扔向坦克，落地时她感到玻璃碎片刺入背部。那生物开始向她走来，就在这时，枪声再次响彻整个房间，她和怪物同时转向声源，只见真嗣站在那里，枪口直指怪物。

Quickly it charged towards him and knocked him into one of the pipes knocking it loose, almost immediately white foam began pouring out of it endlessly. A drop of it fell onto the monster and it roared out. It jumped to its feet and threw Shinji across the room, Asuka by this time had stood up, Shinji turned and threw his gun over at her. She fired a shot from the gun and watched the bullet bounce harmlessly off of the beasts back. It was enough to distract it for a bit though as she quickly dashed over to where the coolant was leaking, she felt some of it dropping on her and a shiver was sent down her spine due to how cold it was. She pulled the thing off the wall and fired more shots at the beast, hoping it would take the bait.  
它迅速向他冲去，将他撞进一根管道，使其松脱，几乎立刻，白色泡沫便源源不断地涌出。一滴泡沫落在怪物身上，它咆哮起来。怪物一跃而起，将真嗣甩向房间另一头，此时明日香已站起身来，真嗣转身将枪抛给她。她开了一枪，子弹却无害地从怪物背上弹开。但这足以分散它的注意力，她迅速冲向冷却液泄漏处，感到一些液体滴落在身上，因寒冷而打了个寒颤。她扯下墙上的装置，向怪物连开数枪，希望它能上钩。

It raised itself up and looked at her, its face still tilted slightly and began to move towards her, she quickly dodged out of the way and rammed the pipe directly into where the creature's eye socket would have been. It roared out in pain as the foam entered its body and began to seep out of the cracks in its grey armor. After a few moments Asuka let go of the pipe and sank to her knees, the monster next to her now seemingly frozen in place. She looked over at Shinji who appeared to be injured but was now slowly getting to his feet and smiled slightly.  
它直起身来，脸微微侧向她，开始向她移动。她迅速闪开，将管子直接插入怪物本该是眼窝的地方。随着泡沫进入其体内并从灰色盔甲的裂缝中渗出，它痛苦地咆哮起来。片刻后，明日香松开管子，跪倒在地，身边的怪物现在似乎静止不动了。她看向真嗣，他似乎受了伤，但正慢慢站起身来，她微微一笑。

"Thanks, guess I owe you one for rescuing me."  
“谢谢，看来我欠你一个人情，救了我。”

He looked at her and then at the frozen figure in front of him.  
他看着她，然后看向面前静止不动的身影。

"Don't mention it, I guess this was the next Angel."  
"别客气，我想这就是下一个天使了。"

"What makes you say that?"  
"你为什么这么说？"

"Look to your left." "向左看。"

Asuka looked to her left at where she had tore the pipe from the wall, above was a small tank, the white foam still dripping from it. On the center of the tank however was the familiar seven eyed logo.  
明日香向左看去，那里是她从墙上扯下管道的地方，上方有一个小水箱，白色的泡沫仍在从上面滴落。然而，在水箱的中央，是那个熟悉的七眼标志。

### Chapter 13 Fear

_10th June 2015 2015 年 6 月 10 日_

**Morgue – 1115 hours 太平间 – 上午 11 点 15 分**

Shinji walked into the corridor, Rei moving directly behind him. He paused for a moment and looked around before entering the morgue. In the center of the morgue was the medical table, a body draped in a blanket on the top. The arm was hanging down. Shinji moved closer, examining the stiffened arm of the person he and Asuka had apprehended yesterday. He looked around at Rei, her eyes fixed on the covered body in front of them. Shinji was almost certain he could pick up traces of hatred in them.  
真嗣走进走廊，绫波紧随其后。他停顿片刻，环顾四周后才进入停尸房。停尸房中央是一张医用台，上面覆盖着一条毯子，躺着一具尸体。一只手臂垂落下来。真嗣走近，仔细观察着昨天他和明日香逮捕的那个人僵硬的手臂。他环顾绫波，她的目光紧盯着他们面前的盖着毯子的尸体。真嗣几乎可以肯定，他能在她的眼神中捕捉到一丝恨意。

"Ayanami are you alright?" he questioned quietly.  
“绫波，你还好吗？”他轻声问道。

"I am fine, thank you."  
“我没事，谢谢。”

"I hear you're staying at Agent Sohryu's until you can get a new place."  
"听说你暂时住在苏里玉特工那里，直到找到新住处。"

"That is correct." "是的，没错。"

"So what are the arrangements?"  
"那安排是怎样的？"

"I'm sleeping downstairs, she's also requested I help out cleaning up and making dinner."  
"我睡楼下，她还要求我帮忙打扫和做晚饭。"

"And you're okay with that?" Shinji asked, a little surprised.  
"你能接受吗？" 真嗣有点惊讶地问。"

"It is acceptable, I asked if she wanted me to pay her for staying but she said splitting up the tasks would be easier. She did seem to be agitated that she was not able to come here today though."  
"可以接受，我问过她是否需要支付住宿费，但她认为分担任务会更方便。不过她确实显得有些烦躁，因为今天没能来这里。"

"That's understandable, after all she was the one that actually caught the guy"  
"那可以理解，毕竟她才是真正抓住那家伙的人。"

"I was under the impression that it was both of you, she told me that you both captured him."  
"我以为是你俩一起的，她告诉我你们俩一起抓住了他。"

"Oh, I see." "哦，我明白了。"

Shinji was about to say more however he was cut off by the door opening, two more people entered the room. The first of which was Misato, the second however Shinji did not know, it was a blonde haired doctor around the same age as Misato. As Shinji and the doctor's eyes met, Shinji sworn he had seen her somewhere before, but he shrugged it off. It was then that Misato introduced him to the doctor.  
真嗣正要再说些什么，却被开门声打断，又有两个人走进了房间。第一个是美里，第二个真嗣不认识，那是一位金发的女医生，年纪和美里相仿。当真嗣和医生的目光相遇时，他发誓自己曾在哪里见过她，但他随即摇摇头，不再多想。这时，美里向他介绍了那位医生。

"Good to see you both, I'd like you to meet Doctor Ritsuko Akagi. She's been assigned to work with us."  
"很高兴见到你们，我想介绍你们认识一下赤木律子博士。她被指派来与我们一起工作。"

As soon as Shinji heard the name he remembered where he had seen the woman before, she was one of Misato's friends from when he had lived with her, although back then she had different colored hair.  
听到这个名字，真嗣立刻想起了在哪里见过这位女士，她是美里以前的朋友之一，尽管那时她的头发颜色不同。

"Doctor Akagi, good to meet you."  
"赤木博士，很高兴见到您。"

"It's my pleasure, Shinji." She smiled  
"这是我的荣幸，真嗣。" 她微笑着说

They shook hands and Ritsuko then turned to Rei and smiled slightly.  
他们握了握手，然后律子转向绫波，微微一笑。

"Agent Ayanami, we meet again, how's it going?"  
"绫波特工，我们又见面了，近来如何？"

Both Shinji and Misato shot each other concerned glances, the fact that both Ayanami and Ritsuko knew each other was certainly unexpected.  
真嗣和美里互相对视了一眼，都带着关切的神情。绫波和律子彼此相识的事实确实出乎意料。

"Fine, thank you." “很好，谢谢。”

Misato cheerily cut in. 美里愉快地插话道。

"Doctor Akagi has been assigned to work with you guys here at the labs, to examine anything you bring in."  
"赤木医生已被指派到我们实验室，负责检查你们带进来的任何物品。"

"I see." "原来如此。"

Shinji nodded and turned his focus towards the body on the table, Risuko was also looking at it curiously. She didn't seem to have noticed the arm yet, or simply didn't care. He moved out of the way allowing her access to it, as she moved towards it she turned to him and spoke.  
真嗣点点头，将注意力转向桌上的尸体，律子也好奇地看着它。她似乎还没有注意到那只手臂，或者根本不在乎。他让开位置，让她能够接近，她走向尸体时转向他，开口说道。

"Moving onto more important things, what do we have?"  
"先谈更重要的事，我们有什么发现？"

"Unidentified male, attacked several people on a subway train yesterday morning and fled down the tracks. He attacked Agent Sohryu and she was able to stop him, unfortunately killing him."  
不明身份男性，昨日清晨在地铁列车上袭击多人后沿轨道逃逸。他攻击了索留香特工，她虽成功制服但不幸致其死亡。

"I see." "原来如此。"

She drew back the cover and looked at the body. He looked exactly the same as he had yesterday when Shinji and Asuka had first encountered him. Dried coolant was caked around the eye sockets, protruding from cracks within the creatures shell, but overall it remained still in its hardened protective case. Ritsuko picked up a scalpel from the tray and tapped lightly at the body.  
她掀开覆盖物，审视着尸体。他与昨日真嗣和明日香首次遭遇时别无二致。干涸的冷却剂凝结在眼眶周围，从生物外壳的裂缝中凸出，但整体依旧静止在其硬化保护壳内。律子从托盘上拿起一把手术刀，轻轻敲击着尸体。

"Interesting." “有意思。”

"What is?" "什么？"

"The body, or maybe shell would be a more accurate, is an incredibly hard to break material, it'll be nearly impossible to break through using any of the tools here. Tell me, how many shots did you and Agent Sohryu fire at this creature."  
"这个躯体，或许用‘外壳’来形容更准确，是一种极难破坏的材料，用这里的任何工具几乎都不可能穿透。告诉我，你和索留香特工向这个生物开了多少枪？"

"About two clips." "大约两个弹匣。"

"Impressive, it's shell was made to withstand any sort of attack ranging from simple hand to hand to gunfire, I'd bet you could even dip this guy in a Volcano and it'd come out unharmed."  
"真是惊人，它的外壳设计能抵御从简单的肉搏到枪击的各种攻击，我敢打赌，就算把它扔进火山里，它也能毫发无损地出来。"

"What about the cracks and eyes?" Shinji asked.  
"那裂缝和眼睛呢？" 真嗣问道。"

"Where did you find it?"  
"你是在哪儿找到它的？"

"Some strange sort of tank, there were pipes leading into the tank but it burst through and attacked us," he explained.  
“某种奇怪的坦克，有管道通向它，但它突然破裂并攻击了我们。”他解释道。

"This might sound a bit strange but maybe a type of growth chamber, that might explain the cracks in the armor." Akagi theorized.  
“这听起来可能有点奇怪，但或许是一种生长室，那可以解释装甲上的裂缝。”赤城推测道。

Shinji eyed her, suspiciously wondering why she didn't find what he has said even a little bit strange. He spoke again failing to hide his surprise.  
真嗣怀疑地看着她，不明白为什么她对他的话一点也不觉得奇怪。他再次开口，无法掩饰自己的惊讶。

"You mean you don't find this bizarre?"  
"你是说你不觉得这很奇怪吗？"

"Oh I do, but I'm just here to examine it. You along with Agent's Ayanami and Sohryu are the ones handling the investigation. Besides growth chambers aren't too far out a concept, they have been experimented with since the impact incident it's just..."  
"哦，我确实觉得奇怪，但我只是来研究它的。你和绫波丽、惣流探员才是负责调查的人。再说了，生长室的概念并不新鲜，自从撞击事件以来就一直有人在实验，只是……"

As she spoke her eyes quickly flashed towards Rei and back to Shinji.  
她说话时，目光迅速扫过绫波，又回到真嗣身上。

"…no one has tried it with a human subject, if this is the case here it's both a brilliant example of genetic alteration." She said "But it's also highly illegal."  
"…还没有人尝试过在人类身上进行这种实验，如果这里的情况确实如此，那这既是一个基因改造的杰出例子。" 她说，"但这也是高度违法的。"

"So this is human, just altered?"  
"所以这是人类，只是被改造了？"

"I'd assume so, I won't know more until I find a way into the armor however."  
"我猜是这样，不过要了解更多，我得先找到进入那盔甲的方法。"

"How long do you think it's going to take?"  
"你觉得这要花多长时间？"

"I don't know, conventional tools won't allow me through. I could however use a special tool that is being developed, it would help me examine it and also could provide some more specialized information."  
"我不知道，常规工具无法让我通过。不过，我可以用一种正在开发的特殊工具，它能帮助我检查并提供更专业的信息。"

"Special tool?" "特殊工具？"

"The MAGI, a special operating system that I helped to develop incorporating the latest in Nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, might be helpful. I could inject a few of the nanoprobes linked to it through the cracks in the armor and it would explore what's inside."  
"MAGI，一个我参与开发的特殊操作系统，结合了最新的纳米技术和人工智能技术，可能会派上用场。我可以通过装甲的裂缝注入一些与之相连的纳米探针，它们会探索内部的情况。"

Shinji nodded slightly, Misato looked at him confused, murmuring slightly.  
真嗣微微点头，美里困惑地看着他，轻声嘀咕。

"Umm, nanotechnology?" "嗯，纳米技术？"

Shinji turned towards her and spoke.  
真嗣转向她，开口说道。

"Using tiny machines to perform specific functions that humans can't or would have difficulty with, or just to make it easier, for example performing complex medical procedures."  
利用微型机器执行人类无法完成或难以执行的特定功能，或者仅仅是为了简化操作，例如执行复杂的医疗程序。

Ritsuko glanced at him, looking slightly impressed.  
律子瞥了他一眼，显得略微有些佩服。

"You know your stuff it would seem, Shinji."  
"看来你对这些很在行啊，真嗣。"

He blushed slightly, stammering as he replied.  
他微微脸红，结巴着回答。

"I...I watch a lot of Sci-Fi shows."  
"我...我看了不少科幻节目。"

Before Ritsuko could reply to him the door swung open abruptly and Asuka stepped into the room. She immediately went up to Shinji and Rei, panting slightly, seemingly exhausted. Shinji gave her a chance to catch her breath, before speaking.  
在律子还没来得及回答他之前，门突然猛地打开，明日香走进了房间。她立刻走向真嗣和丽，微微喘着气，似乎非常疲惫。真嗣给了她一点时间喘口气，然后才开口说话。

"Agent Sohryu, are you alright?"  
“惣流小姐，你还好吗？”

"Yeah I'm fine, I just ran here from the main offices, that's all."  
“嗯，我没事，只是从主办公室跑过来的，仅此而已。”

"Why, what's happened?" “哎呀，发生什么事了？”

"We just got a note, specifically asking for us three. I don't know who but they said it was something we would be interested in."  
“我们刚收到一张便条，特别指明要我们三个去。不知道是谁，但他们说这是我们会感兴趣的事。”

**Tokyo 3 Grand Hotel – 1150 hours  
东京 3 号大酒店 – 11 点 50 分**

The Grand hotel was probably everything that you wouldn't expect from a hotel named as such. Located in one of the more rundown areas of the city, it was the type of place that attracts only those who had just enough for a room for the night or those who wanted a cheap thrill away from prying eyes. Shinji stepped out of the car and looked down the street. All the buildings had the same gaunt, rundown and grey look about them. He shut the car door and waited for both Asuka and Rei to step out before moving towards the hotel. As he moved towards the front he heard Asuka muttering under her breath as she eyed the various pieces of trash and stains littering the ground.  
大酒店这个名字，或许会让你对这家酒店的一切都抱有完全不同的期待。它坐落在城市中较为破败的区域之一，吸引的只有那些刚好能支付一晚房费的人，或是那些想在窥探目光之外寻求廉价刺激的人。真嗣下了车，沿着街道望去。所有的建筑都呈现出一种憔悴、破旧且灰暗的外观。他关上车门，等待明日香和绫波下车后，才向酒店走去。当他走向前门时，听到明日香低声咒骂，同时目光扫过地面上散落的垃圾和污渍。

"Disgusting." “恶心。”

He refrained from speaking but inside he agreed with her, he moved into the hotel, brushing a cobweb off of him as he entered the main lobby. Inside was completely empty, he walked up to the reception desk and tapped the bell, waiting for someone to appear. After a few moments of waiting he turned to both Agents and sighed impatiently.  
他忍住了说话的冲动，但内心深处却与她意见一致。他走进酒店，拂去身上的蜘蛛网，进入主大厅。里面空无一人，他走到接待台前，按了按铃，等待有人出现。等待片刻后，他转向两位特工，不耐烦地叹了口气。

"I guess there's no one in, should we just head up to the room?"  
"我想里面没人，我们直接上楼去房间吧？"

Asuka turned towards the staircase and nodded.  
明日香转向楼梯，点了点头。

"I don't see why not."  
"我没意见。"

She began to make her way over towards the stairway when a man appeared from one of the corridors and blocked her off. He eyed her and grinned wickedly.  
她开始向楼梯走去，这时一个男人从一条走廊里出现，挡住了她的去路。他打量着她，邪恶地咧嘴笑了。

"And where do you think you're going lady?"  
“你以为你要去哪儿，女士？”

Asuka glared at him, a disgusted expression on her face, he was a short fat man, bald and wearing a stained white vest. She wasted no time in reaching for her ID and showing it to him.  
明日香瞪着他，脸上露出厌恶的表情，他是个矮胖的男人，秃顶，穿着一件脏兮兮的白背心。她毫不犹豫地伸手拿出她的身份证，展示给他看。

"I'm Agent Sohryu from NERV, we're here regarding the incident that took place here last night."  
"我是来自 NERV 的代理官长良（Sohryu），我们来此是为了调查昨晚发生在这里的事件。"

"NERV, eh?" "NERV，是吗？"

He paused a moment, looking at all three of the Agents, and smiled slightly, he moved aside allowing them past.  
他停顿了一下，目光扫过三位代理官，微微一笑，随即侧身让他们通过。

"Well I'm not going to stop you, just try not to disturb any of the clients, we don't want people to think this is a bad place."  
"好吧，我不会阻止你，只是尽量别打扰到其他客人，我们不想让人以为这里是个糟糕的地方。"

Asuka moved past him but stopped before she got to the staircase.  
明日香从他身边走过，但在到达楼梯前停了下来。

"I'll keep that in mind, before we go I'd like to ask a few questions about the person."  
"我会记住的，在我们走之前，我想问几个关于那个人的问题。"

"Go ahead." The man nodded.  
"请继续。" 那人点头道。

"Was she a regular at this hotel?"  
"她经常来这家酒店吗？"

"No, never seen her or her friend before. They both checked in late last night, none of them checked out. Found the woman dead in the room this morning and no trace of the man."  
"不，从没见过她和她的朋友。她们俩昨晚深夜才入住，都没退房。今早在房间里发现了那女人的尸体，但那男人却不见踪影。"

"So then, has anything like this ever happened before?"  
"那么，以前发生过类似的事情吗？"

Asuka watched his eyes as he replied, it was obvious he was lying.  
明日香注视着他的眼睛回答，显然他在撒谎。

"People dying in rooms? No, never." He shook his head, somewhat rattled.  
"有人在房间里死去？不，从未有过。" 他摇了摇头，显得有些不安。

"That'll be all then, get the records of when they checked in ready for us when we come down and the details."  
"那就这样吧，准备好他们入住的记录，等我们下来时要用。"

"Yes." "是的。"

She put away her ID and began to move up the staircase, both Shinji and Rei following her. After a short while she made it to the third floor, various smells filled the areas she walked on. She assumed drugs, it wouldn't surprise her if this wasn't the first incident of this type in here. It was common for people to die of drug overdoses in establishments such as this. She reached her destination and moved to open the door, stopping as she reached the handle and recoiled slightly.  
她收起身份证，开始沿着楼梯向上走，真嗣和丽紧随其后。不久，她到达了三楼，各种气味弥漫在她所经过的区域。她猜测是毒品，如果这里不是第一次发生这种事，她也不会感到惊讶。在这种地方，因吸毒过量而死的人很常见。她到达了目的地，伸手去开门，却在触碰到门把手时微微退缩。

"Urgh." "呃。"

Shinji moved over, looking concerned as he examined the door.  
真嗣挪了过来，担忧地检查着门。

"What is it, are you alright?"  
“怎么了，你还好吗？”

"I'm fine, just there's a spider on the door handle. Do you think maybe you could open this, Ikari?"  
“我没事，只是门把手上有一只蜘蛛。你能帮我开一下吗，碇？”

He began to move his hand towards the door handle and then paused when he caught sight of the eight legged creature on it. He knelt down slowly and took a closer look, it was a pale orange color, similar to that of a tarantula, but much smaller. As he looked, Asuka knelt in, looking at it.  
他开始将手伸向门把手，却在瞥见上面的八腿生物时顿住了。他缓缓跪下，仔细观察，那生物呈淡橙色，类似狼蛛，但小得多。正当他凝视时，明日香也凑了过来，一同观察。

"I don't know much about Spiders, but I'm pretty sure I've never seen that in Japan."  
“我对蜘蛛了解不多，但我很确定在日本从未见过这种。”

"No nor have I, what do you think Ayanami?"  
“我也没有，绫波，你怎么看？”

He turned his head and noticed Rei was standing with her back firmly against the opposite wall, her eyes showing traces of fear. She looked towards the spider and nodded slightly.  
他转过头，注意到丽正背靠着对面的墙壁，眼中流露出一丝恐惧。她朝蜘蛛的方向微微点头。

"No, I've never seen anything like that." she stuttered.  
“不，我从没见过这样的东西。”她结巴着说。

Asuka stood up and looked at her.  
明日香站起身来，看着她。

"How could you have seen it from there?"  
"你怎么可能从那里看到？"

"I…I…" "我……我……"

A wicked grin came across the red haired Agent's face as she suddenly realized the reason for Rei's reluctance to move towards the door.  
红发特工脸上露出了狡黠的笑容，她突然意识到丽不愿向门口移动的原因。

"You're scared of it, aren't you?"  
"你害怕它，对吧？"

Rei merely nodded, her face glowing slightly red, it was the first time Shinji or Asuka had ever seen Rei act with real emotion.  
丽只是点了点头，她的脸微微泛红，这是真嗣或明日香第一次看到丽表现出真正的情感。

"I dislike…spiders." "我不喜欢……蜘蛛。"

Shinji stood up, also smiling slightly, he looked at the door and then to the door handle and brought his hand back from opening it. Asuka turned to him, still grinning.  
真嗣站起身，也微微一笑，他先是看向门，又转向门把手，手从开门的位置缩了回来。明日香转向他，依旧咧着嘴笑。

"Not you as well, are you going to open it then?"  
“连你也不敢开，是吗？那你打算开吗？”

"I don't see you moving to open it." he retorted.  
“我看你也没动身去开啊。”他反驳道。

"That's because," Asuka paused nervously "Look, this isn't about me. Ayanami's the one with the fear of Spiders."  
"那是因为，" 明日香紧张地停顿了一下，"听着，这跟我没关系。绫波才是那个怕蜘蛛的人。"

"Yes, but what if it bites me?" Shinji glanced up, sheepishly.  
"是的，但如果它咬我怎么办？" 真嗣抬头望去，有些羞怯。"

"Well what if it bites me?" Asuka replied, snapping at him.  
"那如果它咬我呢？" 明日香回敬道，语气有些急躁。"

They both stood there and thought for a moment, until Shinji finally spoke again.  
他们俩站在那里沉思片刻，直到真嗣终于再次开口。

"Ok, there's only one thing for it."  
“好吧，只有一件事可做了。”

Both of them looked at each other and nodded, Rei looked on from the opposite side, wondering what the two of them were doing. She watched as they both counted quietly to three, turned and kicked the door open, sending the spider hurtling towards her, she quickly moved out of the way and looked around to see Asuka laughing at her.  
两人对视一眼，点头示意，丽从对面看着，好奇他们在做什么。她看到他们俩默默数到三，转身一脚踢开门，把蜘蛛踢向她，她迅速闪开，环顾四周，看到明日香正对着她笑。

"You really don't like them do you?"  
"你真的不喜欢他们，对吧？"

Rei shook her head and moved towards them both.  
丽摇了摇头，向他们俩走去。

"Can we please get on with this?" she said.  
"我们能不能快点开始？" 她说。

"Of course, you know I've always wanted to do that." Asuka remarked.  
"当然，你知道我一直想这么做。" 明日香说道。

"Do what?" "做什么？"

"Burst through a door, always sounded like fun."  
"破门而入，听起来总是很有趣。"

"I don't understand." "我不明白。"

"Never mind, let's just see the body…"  
"算了，我们还是去看看尸体吧……"

She paused as she entered the room and immediately went pale, she looked at Shinji, he had also gone pale as the putrid smell hit their noses. Towards the center of the room lay the body they had came to look at, around it on the carpet were bloodstains and the legs and arms appeared to be held down by various cobwebs. From behind her Asuka heard Ayanami slowly back out of the room. She turned towards her, wishing she could do the same.  
她走进房间时顿了顿，脸色立刻变得苍白，她看向真嗣，他也同样面无血色，因为那股腐臭味扑鼻而来。房间中央躺着他们此行要查看的尸体，周围地毯上血迹斑斑，四肢似乎被各种蛛网固定住。在她身后，她听到绫波慢慢退出了房间。她转头望向她，真希望自己也能这么做。

"That's disgusting." “太恶心了。”

Shinji nodded, fearing that if he spoke he would throw up, instead he moved closer towards the body and peered into it. The body itself appeared to be fully intact, however there did appear to be insect bites amongst the flesh, with two larger bites up near the neck. Shinji flinched when he thought he saw something moving inside. He and Asuka leaned in closer and noticed it was the squirming body of another one of those Spiders they had encountered previously. Shinji breathed deeply and turned to Asuka.  
真嗣点点头，生怕一开口就会吐出来，于是他更靠近尸体，仔细观察。尸体本身看似完好无损，但确实有些虫咬的痕迹，尤其是颈部附近有两个较大的咬痕。真嗣一惊，以为看到里面有什么东西在动。他和明日香凑近一看，发现是之前遇到过的那种蜘蛛的幼体在蠕动。真嗣深吸一口气，转向明日香。

"We need to get this body out of here and examined."  
“我们需要把这具尸体搬出去检查。”

"No kidding, we need to find the person this woman was with as well."  
“别开玩笑了，我们还得找到这个女人当时在一起的那个人。”

"Let's get out of here and call NERV and get them to get this body to a lab, we should ask the guy downstairs a few more questions about this too."  
“我们离开这里，打电话给 NERV，让他们把这具尸体送到实验室去，我们也应该再问楼下那家伙几个问题。”

**Medical Labs – 1310 hours  
医疗实验室 – 13:10**

Asuka stared over at the body on the slab, moving her eyes towards the spiders squirming around in the tank. She shuddered slightly as she watched them running, vainly trying to escape from their glass prison. She wasn't usually scared of something as silly as a spider, but something about this type struck her, it had an even worse effect on Rei, who was waiting outside the room. Asuka smiled slightly at Rei's reaction to the eight legged creature, it was amusing to know she'd some sort of fear. It made her seem slightly more human than she had been in the past few weeks.  
明日香凝视着石板上那具身体，目光转向水箱中蠕动着的蜘蛛。她微微颤抖，看着它们徒劳地试图逃离玻璃牢笼。她通常并不害怕像蜘蛛这样愚蠢的东西，但这种类型的蜘蛛却让她感到不安，对绫波来说更是如此，她正在房间外等待。明日香对绫波对八条腿生物的反应微微一笑，知道她有某种恐惧感颇为有趣。这让她看起来比过去几周更像人类一些。

Her view of the tanks was obscured when Shinji stepped directly in front of them and lowered himself to get a good view of the contents. Asuka couldn't help herself but comment on the way he was studying them.  
当真嗣直接走到水箱前并蹲下身来仔细观察里面的内容时，她的视线被挡住了。明日香忍不住对他观察它们的方式发表了评论。

"You know, they're strange but I don't think they're going to be able to communicate."  
“你知道，它们虽然奇怪，但我觉得它们没法交流。”

He turned around and smiled before frowning slightly and turning back round to look at the spiders.  
他转过身，微笑了一下，随即微微皱眉，再次转回去看那些蜘蛛。

"I'm not trying to communicate with them, but I'm wondering where they came from."  
“我并不是想与它们交流，只是好奇它们从何而来。”

"Some weirdo imported them illegally into the country most likely, it's not unusual. If I remember correctly about six years ago there was an incident in the US where a man supposed to testify against a crime boss was being transported in a plane, and the crime boss was able to smuggle hundreds of illegally imported snakes onto the plane and they got out, attacking everything."  
“很可能是个怪人非法进口到国内的，这并不罕见。如果我没记错的话，大约六年前在美国发生过一起事件，一个本应出庭指证黑帮头目的人在飞机上被押送，而那个黑帮头目竟然能偷偷将数百条非法进口的蛇带上飞机，结果蛇逃了出来，袭击了所有东西。”

"Did that really happen, it sounds ridiculous, sounds like a bad movie plot?"  
"那真的发生了吗？听起来太荒谬了，简直像一部糟糕的电影剧情。"

"No it happened, caused quite a bit of bother as well."  
"是的，确实发生了，还引起了不少麻烦。"

Ritsuko came into the room. Asuka looked at the doctor, she had caught a glimpse of her earlier on in the day but this was the first time she had been able to see her up close. Their eyes met for a brief moment and almost immediately Asuka felt as if she had met the woman somewhere before.  
律子走进房间。明日香看着医生，她今天早些时候瞥见过她，但这是她第一次近距离看到她。她们的目光短暂交汇，几乎立刻，明日香就觉得她好像在哪儿见过这个女人。

"Agent Sohyu, Ikari I've finished the analysis on the body. I had the Magi run the analysis to save time. You might find what its came up with quite interesting."  
"碇司令，代理，我已经完成了对尸体的分析。为了节省时间，我让 MAGI 进行了分析。你们可能会发现结果相当有趣。"

Asuka looked at her before speaking.  
明日香看了她一眼，然后开口说道。

"Sorry, have I met you before?"  
"抱歉，我们之前见过吗？"

Ritsuko stared at the red headed agent, blinking for a few seconds before responding calmly.  
律子盯着那位红发特工，眨了几秒钟眼后平静地回应。

"No I don't think so, I haven't been in Tokyo 3 long, I've been elsewhere working on the Magi systems."  
“不，我不这么认为，我在第三新东京市待的时间不长，一直在其他地方致力于 MAGI 系统的工作。”

"I see, never mind, just thought I recognized you that's all."  
“我明白了，没关系，只是觉得好像认识你，仅此而已。”

"No worries, now do you want to see what the Magi has came up with?"  
"别担心，现在你想看看魔术师们想出了什么吗？"

"Sure thing." "当然可以。"

She lead them out into a corridor where they met up with Rei again, as they followed Ritsuko she began to explain some of the results and a bit more about the nature of the Magi.  
她带领他们走出房间，来到走廊，在那里他们再次遇到了丽，随着他们跟随律子，她开始解释一些结果，并更多地介绍了魔术师的本质。

"As you know the Magi were developed to be a perfect artificial intelligence system that can fit in anywhere. Medical analysis and research, governmental decision making, the MAGI was designed to handle it all. NERV is currently serving as the main testing area for the MAGI system."  
"正如你所知，Magi 系统被开发为一种完美的仿生智能系统，能够适应任何环境。无论是医学分析与研究，还是政府决策制定，Magi 系统都被设计来处理这一切。NERV 目前正作为 Magi 系统的主要测试区域。"

Shinji nodded, not really too interested. Ritsuko didn't notice and continued speaking.  
真嗣点点头，其实并不太感兴趣。律子没有注意到，继续说道。

"Being tested alongside the MAGI Systems is the first practical implementation of nanotechnology, tiny machines that we are able to inject into the patient and carry out major medical procedures and autopsies, eliminating the risk of a human doctor accidentally slicing open something that shouldn't be sliced."  
"与 Magi 系统一同进行测试的，是纳米技术的首次实际应用，这些微型机器能够被注入患者体内，执行重大医疗程序和尸检，从而消除了人类医生意外切开不应触碰部位的风险。"

Asuka chimed in at this point.  
此时，明日香插话进来。

"You mentioned government use, I suppose they could be used to watch over people as well."  
“你提到了政府用途，我想它们也可以用来监视民众。”

They all paused. Shinji looked at Asuka oddly, usually it would be him to ask such a question. Ritsuko raised her eyebrows in surprise, trying to think of a way to reply.  
他们都停顿了一下。真嗣奇怪地看着明日香，通常这种问题都是他来问的。律子扬起眉毛，感到惊讶，试图想出一个回答的方式。

"Well…I suppose, but that's not what it's intended for. That's why we're only focusing on the medical areas for the moment."  
"嗯……我想可以，但这不是它的初衷。所以我们目前只专注于医疗领域。"

"What about genetic engineering?"  
"那基因工程呢？"

Ristuko frowned, trying to work out where Asuka was going with this line of questioning. Asuka stood there, carefully examining Ritsuko's reaction and reply.  
律子皱起眉头，试图弄清楚明日香问这个问题的意图。明日香站在那里，仔细观察着律子的反应和回答。

"Possible once again but genetic engineering has been outlawed by the Japanese Government so I doubt we'll be seeing it used for that any time soon."  
"再次成为可能，但基因工程已被日本政府禁止，所以我怀疑我们近期内不会看到它被用于此目的。"

"I see, so what did it come up with in our example?"  
"我明白了，那么在我们的例子中，它得出了什么结论？"

They entered another room, it was set up like a laboratory but towards the center were three huge computer towers. Each one had a name written on it, Shinji immediately recognized the names.  
他们进入另一个房间，这里布置得像一个实验室，但朝向中心的地方有三座巨大的计算机塔。每座塔上都写着名字，真嗣立刻认出了这些名字。

'_Melchior, Balthasar, Casper.'_  
'梅尔基奥尔，巴尔塔扎，卡斯帕。'

"It scanned the body you found at the hotel and the spiders within it. It also found traces of spider venom within the bloodstream, especially around the bite marks."  
“它扫描了你在酒店发现的尸体以及其中的蜘蛛。还发现了血液中尤其是咬痕周围有蜘蛛毒液的痕迹。”

"So what did it find out about the body?"  
“那它对这具尸体有什么发现吗？”

"First of all the spiders within the body and the room you found it in are not native to Japan, nor are they native to anywhere in Asia. In fact, when asked to cross reference the Spider DNA it was unable to match with anything within the database."  
"首先，你体内和发现它的房间里的蜘蛛并非日本原生，也不是亚洲任何地方的原生种。事实上，当要求交叉比对蜘蛛 DNA 时，它无法与数据库中的任何物种匹配。"

"So it failed?" "所以它失败了？"

"No, it was merely unable to produce a match within the known types of arachnid; it was however able to find partial DNA matches with another species. Now at first I wasn't sure if this was the system malfunctioning but I ran the test again and got the same results."  
"不，它只是无法在已知的蜘蛛种类中找到匹配项；然而，它确实能够找到与其他物种的部分 DNA 匹配。起初我不确定这是否是系统故障，但我重新进行了测试，得到了相同的结果。"

"What was the match?" "比赛结果如何？"

"A twenty eight percent match with humans, the rest inconclusive."  
"与人类匹配度为百分之二十八，其余结果尚不明确。"

Shinji muttered under his breath.  
真嗣低声咕哝着。

"Impossible…" "不可能……"

"Second thing it found out was when analyzing the bite marks. All but one of the bite marks matched the spiders found. However when analyzing the main bite mark on the neck it found that the bites did not match that of a spider but that of a…"  
"第二件事是在分析咬痕时发现的。除了一个咬痕外，其他所有咬痕都与发现的蜘蛛相符。然而，当分析脖子上的主要咬痕时，发现这些咬痕并不符合蜘蛛的特征，而是……"

"…human." "……人类的。"

Everyone turned to look where the voice had come from; standing towards the back of the room focused directly on Ritsuko was Rei. Ritsuko merely looked at her, impressed that she would have known.  
所有人都转向声音的来源；站在房间后部，目光直指赤木律子的正是绫波零。赤木律子只是看着她，对她能知道这一点感到惊讶。

"Correct, Agent Ayanami."  
“没错，绫波零特工。”

Shinji was about to ask a further question when his cell phone began to ring, he picked it up and spoke into it.  
真嗣正要进一步提问，这时他的手机开始响了，他拿起手机接听。

"Hello." “你好。”

"_Shinji, its Misato, there's been three more deaths. Employees there are reporting some strange spider infestation in the bodies, but when they move out of a certain range they simply die."_  
"真嗣，是我，美里。又有三个人死了。员工们报告说尸体上有奇怪的蜘蛛侵扰，但一旦它们离开某个特定范围就会直接死亡。"

"Where is this?" "这是哪儿？"

"_Cargo Warehouse 3 over at the Tokyo 3 Main Docks, I want you, Sohryu and Ayanami to check it out."_  
"东京 3 号主码头上的 3 号货物仓库，我要你、惣流和绫波去检查一下。"

"We're on our way." "我们马上过去。"

**Warehouse 3 – Docks District – 1335 hours  
第三仓库 – 码头区 – 13 时 35 分**

Rei exited the car and was the first to move to the warehouse door, around the corner she could hear voices, she assumed it was from the workers. Two of them rounded the corner and shouted towards her as she knelt down to examine a trail of orange liquid leaking underneath the door.  
丽离开车，率先走向仓库门，拐角处她能听到声音，猜测是工人们。两人转过拐角，朝她喊道，她正蹲下检查门下渗出的橙色液体痕迹。

"Hey, what do you think you're doing?"  
“嘿，你以为你在干什么？”

She stood up and turned towards them, she immediately withdrew her ID and spoke softly.  
她站起身，转向他们，随即掏出身份证，轻声说道。

"I'm with NERV, we were sent here to investigate the three deaths that occurred inside this warehouse."  
“我是 NERV 的，我们被派来调查这座仓库内发生的三起死亡事件。”

The two men looked at each other, not sure of what to make of Rei, one of them stammered out.  
两名男子面面相觑，对绫波的来意感到困惑，其中一人结结巴巴地开口。

"O…Oh right, you're Agent Ikari?"  
"哦…对了，你是碇队长？""

Rei blinked and looked on coldly at the two workers, she put the ID back in her pocket and replied.  
绫波零眨了眨眼，冷冷地看着那两名工人，她将证件放回口袋，回答道。

"No, I am Agent Ayanami, Agent Ikari is getting the equipment needed and will be along in a moment. I was just checking around the warehouse."  
"不，我是绫波零特工，碇队长正在取所需设备，马上就到。我只是在仓库里检查一下。""

"You mean there are two of you?"  
"你是说有两个你？"

"Three, actually." "实际上是三个。"

They turned around to see where this new voice had come from, Asuka was walking towards them, carrying a small case behind her. Shinji was also carrying a smaller case. They moved over towards Rei and turned to face the two workers. Asuka introduced herself.  
他们转过身，想看看这新声音是从哪儿来的，只见明日香正朝他们走来，身后拖着一个小箱子。真嗣也拿着一个更小的箱子。他们走到丽旁边，转身面对两位工作人员。明日香自我介绍道。

"I'm Agent Sohryu and this is Agent Ikari, were you the two who found the bodies?"  
"我是特工绫波零，这位是特工碇真嗣，是你们两位发现了尸体吗？"

"No it was our boss who found them, we haven't been in the warehouse, all we heard were the screams and something leaving the warehouse."  
"不，是我们老板发现的，我们还没进过仓库，只听到了尖叫声和什么东西离开仓库的声音。"

Shinji raised his eyebrows and spoke, whilst collecting some of the orange liquid trailing from under the warehouse door.  
真嗣挑了挑眉，一边说话，一边收集着从仓库门下蔓延出来的橙色液体。

"Something leaving, can you describe it?"  
"有什么东西离开了，你能描述一下吗？"

"Well yes, it was about six foot, it looked human but…"  
"嗯，是的，大约六英尺高，看起来像人但……"

The other man cut in.  
另一个人插话道。

"It wasn't, it had these strange legs and arms and other things growing out of it, almost like some strange sort of…"  
"它不是，它有这些奇怪的腿和手臂，还有其他东西从上面长出来，几乎像某种奇怪的……"

"Spider?" "蜘蛛？"

They looked at Shinji and nodded.  
他们看着真嗣，点了点头。

"Yes, that's right." “是的，没错。”

Shinji stood back up and handed Asuka the sample of liquid he had picked up, he whispered to her.  
真嗣站起身，将他捡起的液体样本递给明日香，轻声对她说。

"Recognize it?" "认出来了吗？"

She smiled and nodded. 她微笑着点了点头。

"LCL."

Asuka opened the case and placed the sample inside it and looked up towards the men.  
明日香打开箱子，将样本放入其中，然后抬头看向那些人。

"Where can we find your boss?"  
“我们能在哪里找到你们老板？”

One of the men pointed towards a small white office building.  
其中一名男子指向一座小型白色办公楼。

"He'll be in the offices, over there."  
“他会在那边的办公室里。”

"Tell him we'll want to speak to him after we've finished up in here."  
“告诉他，我们这边结束后想和他谈谈。”

"Yes." "是的。"

They both turned and moved towards the building, leaving the three agents to converse amongst themselves. Shinji was the first to speak.  
他们俩转身向建筑物走去，留下三名特工自行交谈。真嗣率先开口。

"Traces of LCL here as well, it seems our killer is another Angel."  
“这里也有 LCL 的痕迹，看来我们的凶手是另一个使徒。”

Asuka nodded and moved towards the door, on the floor she could see the body of a dead spider, the same type they had seen in the previous murder. She moved the door open and shone her torch around in the warehouse and immediately stepped back in fright, dropping her torch. She turned to Rei and Shinji smiling slightly.  
明日香点头，走向门口，地板上她能看到一只死蜘蛛，与之前谋杀现场见到的是同一种。她推开门，用手电筒照向仓库内部，随即惊慌地后退，手电筒掉落在地。她转向绫波和真嗣，微微一笑。

"Well now that I've established the bodies are indeed in there, I think we can begin examining it. Shinji, do you want to take the lead?"  
"既然我已经确认尸体确实在里面，我想我们可以开始检查了。真嗣，你想带头吗？"

Shinji noticed she had become rather pale and seemed to be slightly frightened, he looked at her blankly, Rei did the same. Asuka just continued to grin, bending down to pick up her torch and passing it to Shinji. He looked at the torch and then to Asuka.  
真嗣注意到她变得相当苍白，似乎有些害怕，他茫然地看着她，绫波也一样。明日香只是继续咧嘴笑着，弯腰捡起她的手电筒递给真嗣。他看着手电筒，然后转向明日香。

"What's in there?" he asked.  
"里面有什么？" 他问道。

"Nothing, take a look." “没什么，看看吧。”

She quickly moved behind him and shoved him into the warehouse without giving him a chance to turn the torch on. She turned to Rei and noticed Rei was looking at her harshly, Asuka merely smiled and nodded towards her.  
她迅速绕到他身后，一把将他推进仓库，没给他机会打开手电筒。她转向丽，注意到丽正严厉地看着她，明日香只是微微一笑，向她点头示意。

"I don't think you'll want to go in there."  
“我觉得你不会想进去的。”

"I do not understand." "我不明白。"

Just as Rei finished speaking they heard a yell from inside the warehouse, Asuka laughed and waited for Shinji to exit. From inside they heard him shouting.  
就在丽说完话的时候，他们听到仓库里传来一声喊叫，明日香笑了笑，等着真嗣出来。从里面他们听到他在喊叫。

"Holy shit, this place is covered in them."  
"我靠，这里到处都是这些东西。"

Almost immediately Asuka saw Rei's eyes open wider with fear.  
几乎立刻，Asuka 就看到 Rei 的眼睛因恐惧而睁大了。

"That's why you don't want to go inside."  
“这就是你不想进去的原因。”

A shout came from inside the warehouse again, this time it was Shinji sounding rather amused.  
仓库里再次传来一声喊叫，这次是 Shinji 的声音，听起来颇为好笑。

"It's alright, they're all dead anyway."  
"没事的，反正他们都死了。"

Asuka peeked her head round the corner and was immediately blinded as Shinji accidentally shone the torch in her eyes, causing her to shout back at him.  
明日香探头望向拐角，却被真嗣不小心将手电筒的光直射进眼睛，她立刻大喊着回应。

"You idiot Shinji, what did you do that for?"  
"你这个白痴真嗣，干嘛这么做？"

"Sorry." "对不起。"

Asuka stepped back and looked at Rei quizzically, Rei still seemed hesitant to enter the warehouse.  
明日香退后一步，好奇地看着绫波，绫波似乎仍犹豫是否进入仓库。

"You know, I used to think you had no emotions, especially with how you acted when we first met and how you act in the office, but seeing you like this is quite amusing." She grinned  
“你知道吗，我以前以为你没有感情，尤其是我们初次见面时你的表现，还有你在办公室里的样子，但看到你现在这样，真是挺有趣的。”她咧嘴笑道。

Rei glared at her, her expression not changing. Asuka laughed and continued speaking.  
绫波瞪了她一眼，表情依旧不变。明日香笑了起来，继续说道。

"Sorry, I just found it strange, why are you scared of Spiders anyway?"  
"抱歉，我只是觉得奇怪，你为什么怕蜘蛛呢？"

Rei turned towards her and frowned slightly.  
丽转过身来，微微皱眉。

"They are…unnatural." "它们……不自然。"

Asuka nodded, somehow understanding what Rei meant, although she herself wasn't scared of them she had to admit there was something a bit unnatural about them. She began to enter the warehouse and turned, noticing Rei moving slowly behind her.  
明日香点点头，不知怎的明白了绫波的意思，尽管她自己并不怕它们，但她不得不承认它们有些不自然。她开始进入仓库，转身时注意到绫波在她身后缓慢移动。

"You know, you don't have to come inside if you don't want to."  
“你知道，如果你不想进去，你不必进来。”

"I am fine, it's my job."  
“我没事，这是我的工作。”

They entered the warehouse and moved over to where Shinji was, inside there was a heavy stagnant smell that couldn't be placed. The floor had become a mixture of spider's webs, dead spiders and LCL. Towards the center of the room lay the three bodies of the workers. They were covered in a mixture of blood, LCL and webbing. Asuka knelt down and opened her case and began to collect samples of the LCL on the floor.  
他们进入仓库，朝真嗣所在的地方走去，里面弥漫着一种难以名状的沉重陈腐气味。地板上混杂着蜘蛛网、死蜘蛛和 LCL。房间中央躺着三名工人的尸体，他们全身覆盖着血迹、LCL 和蛛网。明日香蹲下身，打开她的箱子，开始收集地板上的 LCL 样本。

She then moved over to the body Rei was kneeling beside and put on a pair of gloves. Examining the neck of the victim she saw the two bite marks on the side of the neck, noticing immediately they were done by a human. Around the marks were traces of a thick orange liquid, seemingly burning into the skin.  
随后，她走到丽正在检查的尸体旁，戴上了一副手套。她仔细检查受害者的颈部，发现了两侧的咬痕，立刻意识到这是人类所为。咬痕周围有厚厚的橙色液体痕迹，似乎在灼烧皮肤。

"What do you think of this?" Asuka asked.  
“你怎么看这个？”明日香问道。

"It looks like acid, it's eating into the skin."  
"看起来像酸，正在腐蚀皮肤。"

"Agreed, we'll send a sample back to Akagi."  
"同意，我们会送一份样本回给赤城。"

Asuka reached over and attempted to collect a sample of the acidic liquid, however just as she moved towards the body she noticed something moving under the skin. She watched it burrowing out and running away from the body. It was heading towards the front entrance of the warehouse but seemed to just die when it reached the other spiders bodies.  
明日香伸手试图收集一些酸性液体样本，然而就在她靠近尸体时，她注意到皮肤下有什么东西在移动。她看着它钻出来，逃离尸体。它朝着仓库的前门移动，但似乎一到达其他蜘蛛尸体附近就死了。

She watched as another spider scurried out from one of the other bodies and repeated what the previous one had done. Confused, she called out.  
她看着又一只蜘蛛从另一具尸体中匆匆爬出，重复着前一只的动作。困惑之下，她呼喊出声。

"Did you two see that?"  
“你们俩看到了吗？”

Shinji turned from examining another one of the bodies and replied.  
真嗣从检查另一具尸体中转过身来，回答道。

"See what?" "看什么？"

"The spider, crawled out of the body and headed towards the door way but died when it reached a certain point. Another one just done the same thing, look at that area, it's where the trail of LCL goes but it's where most of the dead spiders seem to be."  
"那只蜘蛛，从尸体里爬出来，朝门口爬去，但在到达某个点时死了。另一只刚刚也做了同样的事，看那个区域，那里是 LCL 的痕迹所在，但也是大部分死蜘蛛聚集的地方。"

"Hmm." "嗯。"

"What?" "什么？"

"I'm just thinking, the workers mentioned the thing they saw was half spider half human right?"  
"我只是在想，工人们提到他们看到的东西是半蜘蛛半人形的，对吧？"

Asuka glared at him, wondering where he was going.  
明日香瞪着他，好奇他到底要去哪儿。

"Yeah…but they could have been exaggerating. A thing that's half spider half human, what do you think this is?"  
“是啊……但他们可能夸大其词了。半蜘蛛半人，你以为这是什么？”

Shinji stood up and began excitedly explaining his theory while Asuka and Rei simply looked on.  
真嗣站起身来，兴奋地开始阐述他的理论，而明日香和绫波只是静静地看着。

"No, what if it's true, what if somehow that's what has happened? That would explain this new breed of spider; they're related to the bigger one. All these ones that are running out at trying to find the 'Queen' so to speak."  
"不，如果这是真的，如果某种程度上这就是发生的事实呢？这就能解释这种新型蜘蛛的存在；它们与更大的那只有关联。所有这些试图跑出去寻找所谓‘女王’的蜘蛛。"

"Right, so why are they dying?"  
"对，那它们为什么在死亡？"

"They're out of range of their host, where they grow, and just die off."  
"它们脱离了宿主的生长范围，于是就自然死亡了。"

Asuka stared at him blankly and replied.  
明日香茫然地盯着他，回答道。

"Right, so what you're saying is the thing we have to track down can control spiders, kills people and injects spiders into those dead people. Oh and it spit's acid, can't forget that of course, and it also leaks LCL."  
“好吧，你的意思是我们要追踪的那个东西能控制蜘蛛，杀人并把蜘蛛注入死者体内。哦，还有它喷吐酸液，当然不能忘了这一点，而且它还会泄漏 LCL。”

"Precisely." “正是如此。”

She slapped her forehead and sighed heavily.  
她拍了拍额头，重重地叹了口气。

"That… as to be one of the stupidest theories you've came up with yet Shinji."  
“那……可以说是你迄今为止提出过的最愚蠢的理论了，真嗣。”

"But you can't deny it might be true?"  
“但你不能否认它可能是真的吧？”

She turned to Rei who was also looking at Shinji oddly.  
她转向丽，发现丽也在奇怪地看着真嗣。

"What do you think Ayanami, could he be right, or has he finally gone insane?"  
“你怎么看，绫波，他说得对吗，还是他终于疯了？”

"Given what we can see and the eyewitness reports, it might hold some merit, but it shouldn't be possible."  
“考虑到我们能看到的和目击者的报告，这可能有些道理，但按理说不应该啊。”

Shinji looked at them both, smiling slightly.  
真嗣看着他们俩，微微一笑。

"That's right it shouldn't be possible but look at what has happened, neither should any of that."  
“没错，这本不该可能，但看看发生了什么，那些也不应该。”

Asuka sighed again and stood up, she couldn't believe what she was hearing. She was sure Shinji was insane, this was proving it, she couldn't however deny the possibility of it so decided to give it a chance on one condition.  
明日香再次叹了口气，站起身来，她无法相信自己听到的话。她确信真嗣疯了，这正证明了这一点，但她又无法否认这种可能性，于是决定在一种条件下给予机会。

"Okay, but before we head off looking for some weird sci-fi hybrid, can we analyze what we've got here and then base our opinion on that?"  
"好吧，但在我们出发寻找某种奇怪的科幻混合体之前，我们能不能先分析一下现有的情况，然后再据此形成我们的看法？"

"Ok, sure thing." "好的，当然可以。"

**Medical Labs – 2000 hours  
医疗实验室 – 晚上 8 点**

Ritsuko was staring at the data rolling down the screen, writing down specific things on a small notebook next to her. She stood up and moved over towards a small coffee machine that had been set up in the corner. Just as she began to pour herself a cup, her cellphone began to ring. Looking at the caller ID she smiled slightly and spoke into it.  
律子正盯着屏幕上滚动的数据，同时在旁边的小笔记本上记录着一些要点。她站起身，走向角落里的小咖啡机。正当她开始给自己倒咖啡时，手机响了起来。她看了看来电显示，微微一笑，接起了电话。

"Director Ikari, to what do I owe this honor?"  
“碇指挥官，是什么风把您吹来了？”

"_What is the status of the ninth Angel?"_  
"第九使徒的状况如何？"

"Still unfound, it has killed four at the moment, all three Units are investigating a potential sighting at the moment. It would seem they are on track though, the bodies brought in today contained Angel DNA."  
"目前仍未被发现，已造成四人死亡。三个单位正在调查一处疑似目击地点。看来他们正朝着正确的方向前进，今天带回的尸体中发现了使徒的 DNA。"

"_I see, did any of them recognize you?"_  
"明白了，他们中有谁认出你了吗？"

"Shinji didn't, he was sedated when I injected him with the serum, Asuka however might have done. She did ask if we had met before but I told her I had never been to Tokyo 3 before."  
"真嗣没有，我给他注射血清时他处于镇静状态，但明日香可能记得。她确实问过我们是否之前见过，但我告诉她我从未去过第三新东京市。"

"_I see, if problems arise dispose of her. We cannot afford to mess up, especially now that Keel has contacted them."_  
"我明白了，如果出现问题就处理掉她。我们不能冒险，尤其是在基尔已经联系了他们的情况下。"

Ritsuko tried to hide her shock when she heard Gendo say to dispose of her, but did not do a very good job of it.  
听到源堂说要处理掉她时，律子试图掩饰自己的震惊，但做得并不好。

"Y-Yes sir." "是，先生。"

"_No hesitation, she is expendable."_  
"毫不犹豫，她是可以牺牲的。"

"I understand." "我明白了。"

She awaited a response, instead the phone simply shot out a burst of static followed by silence. She tried to take a look at the screen but noticed the phone had somehow turned itself off.  
她等待着回应，电话却突然发出一阵静电噪音，随后陷入沉默。她试图查看屏幕，却发现手机不知何时已自行关机。

'_Oh great, now wha…'_ '哦天哪，现在怎…'

Just at that moment every device within the lab turned itself off, from down the halls she heard various shouts and crashes and quickly dashed to where the door was. Looking down the hall she saw only darkness. She vaguely made out the shadow of one of the doctors moving towards her and called out.  
就在那一刻，实验室内的所有设备都自行关闭了，从走廊尽头传来了各种喊叫声和撞击声，她迅速冲向门口。望向走廊，她只看到一片黑暗。她隐约辨认出一个医生的身影正向她走来，于是大声呼喊。

"What's going on?" "发生了什么事？"

"City wide blackout, the power has gone out all across the city."  
“全市停电，整个城市的电力都中断了。”

### Chapter 14 Blackout

_12th June 2015 2015 年 6 月 12 日_

**Apartment Complex – 2010 hours  
公寓大楼 – 晚上 8 点 10 分**

Fear: a basic human emotion or reaction to a situation where someone may experience anxiousness or a sense of unease. Fear can manifest itself in many ways: shaking, sickness, paranoia, dizziness or a mixture. It was an emotion Rei Ayanami was quickly becoming acquainted with as she followed behind Agents Ikari and Sohryu through the cramped apartment building.  
恐惧：一种基本的人类情绪，或对可能引发焦虑或不安感的情况的反应。恐惧可以以多种方式表现出来：颤抖、恶心、偏执、眩晕或混合出现。这种情绪，绫波零正迅速地与之熟悉起来，她跟在碇源堂和惣流探员身后，穿过狭窄的公寓楼。

The feeling only heightened with each corridor they entered and with each room they explored as they saw more and more of the sticky white cobwebs hanging from the ceilings and the walls. Sometimes tangling themselves around the Agent's feet, as Rei walked she could hear the crunching and cracking of dead spiders bodies beneath her, each step causing her to feel slightly more sick than she already was.  
随着他们进入的每条走廊和探索的每个房间，这种感觉愈发强烈，他们看到了越来越多从天花板和墙壁上悬挂下来的粘稠白色蛛网。有时这些蛛网会缠绕在探员的脚上，绫波零行走时能听到脚下死蜘蛛尸体被踩碎的声音，每一步都让她感到比之前更加恶心。

Looking ahead she saw the light from her torch shining against the back wall, illuminating more webbing and a distant door. Both Ikari and Sohryu noticed the obvious obstruction and paused taking a few moments to think. Rei stood silently, trying to keep calm and focused, as she had been taught to be in tense situations, trying to will the fear out of her mind. She had always had a hard time trying to grasp emotions, yet for some reason this one fear of hers was always there watching her, waiting to pounce or bite.  
她向前望去，看到手电筒的光线照在背后的墙上，映出了更多的蛛网和一扇遥远的门。无论是碇还是惣流都注意到了明显的障碍，停下脚步，花了几分钟思考。绫波静静地站着，试图保持冷静和专注，正如她在紧张情况下所被教导的那样，努力将恐惧从心中驱散。她一直难以理解情感，但不知为何，这种恐惧总是如影随形，伺机而动，或是猛扑，或是咬噬。

Asuka began to speak, her voice echoing through the corridor.  
明日香开始说话，她的声音在走廊中回荡。

"Looks like this is the last room, and judging by the state of the entrance the one we're looking for."  
“看来这是最后一个房间了，从入口的状态来看，应该就是我们找的那个。”

Shinji stepped towards the door and brushed away some of the webbing on the handle, before readying his gun. Asuka and Rei both did the same and moved towards it, Rei took a deep breath and readied herself as Shinji began to pry the door open. Slowly, and with a loud creaking noise, the door opened, revealing the room. The very sight of it sent a collective shudder down all their spines. Rei slowly stepped backwards as she stared straight ahead. Inside it was the familiar cobweb they had seen all around the rest of the building but it covered the entire room. Except for the solitary hanging light, the entire room was entirely white, grey and in some cases red, the cobwebs stained with blood.  
真嗣走向门口，拂去把手上的蛛网，然后准备好枪。明日香和绫波也做了同样的事，向门口移动。绫波深吸一口气，做好准备，真嗣开始撬门。慢慢地，伴随着刺耳的吱嘎声，门打开了，露出了房间。那景象让他们的脊背都感到一阵寒意。绫波缓缓后退，直视前方。房间里布满了他们在整栋建筑其他地方见过的熟悉蛛网，但这里覆盖了整个房间。除了那盏孤零零的吊灯，整个房间全是白色、灰色，有些地方甚至是红色，蛛网被血迹染红。

All three Agents exchanged glances until Asuka finally gave in with a sigh.  
三位特工互相对视，直到明日香终于叹了口气。

"Okay I'll go in first seeing as you two look too scared, you're lucky I'm here y'know, just think where you'd be if I wasn't."  
“好吧，我先进去，看你们俩吓得，算你们走运有我在，想想如果没有我你们会怎样。”

With those words she stepped into the room, kicking away some of the cobwebs. Shinji merely smiled at her comments, however Rei felt herself frowning slightly. One thing she had noticed in the brief time she had known Agent Sohryu was that she could be quite arrogant towards others at times and could often insult others such as Shinji without really thinking about it. A few more moments went by until Asuka's angered voice came out from inside the room.  
她一边说着，一边踏进房间，踢开了一些蜘蛛网。真嗣只是对她的话报以微笑，然而丽却微微皱起了眉头。在她短暂认识惣流特工的这段时间里，她注意到惣流有时对别人相当傲慢，常常不经思考就对真嗣这样的人出言不逊。又过了片刻，房间里传来了明日香愤怒的声音。

"Look, as much as I love treading in cobwebs, I would appreciate a bit of help in here. That means you Ikari, get your ass in here, there must be at least four bodies in here."  
听着，尽管我挺喜欢踩在蜘蛛网上的感觉，但我还是希望有人能帮帮忙。就是说你，碇，快点进来，这里至少有四具尸体。

Shinji took a step forward into the room and knelt down near one of the bodies buried beneath the webbing. He began to move some of the webbing away when he felt something creeping across his neck. It moved slowly but with each slight movement it sent an ice cold chill down his spine. He tensed up and got ready to speak until he heard Rei speaking behind him.  
真嗣向前迈了一步，走进房间，跪在其中一个被蛛网覆盖的尸体旁。他开始移开一些蛛网，突然感到有什么东西在他脖子上缓缓爬过。它移动得很慢，但每一次轻微的动作都让他脊背发凉。他紧张起来，正要开口，却听到丽在他身后说话。

"Agent Sohryu, what are you doing?"  
"草薙特工，你在做什么？"

He turned to see Asuka, kneeling near him, smiling awkwardly, her hands placed on his neck. Shinji frowned slightly and turned back to the body, as he did so he heard Asuka replying to Rei.  
他转头看到明日香，跪在他旁边，尴尬地笑着，双手放在他的脖子上。真嗣微微皱眉，转回尸体那边，就在这时，他听到明日香回答绫波。

"Nothing I was just examining the body and using Shinji here to help balance myself."  
"没什么，我只是在检查尸体，顺便用真嗣来帮我保持平衡。"

"I see…" "我明白了…"

Shinji felt himself go slightly red as he felt Asuka's hand move onto his shoulder, allowing her to kneel down closer to the body. Tearing away some of the webbing, they got through to the body. Asuka carefully put on a set of gloves and tilted the head of the body, examining the neck, noticing the bite marks. What she found remarkable about this particular set was they seemed to be larger than the others from before.  
当感觉到明日香的手移到自己的肩膀上，让他跪下更靠近尸体时，真嗣的脸微微泛红。他们撕开一些蛛网，终于触及到了尸体。明日香小心翼翼地戴上手套，扶起尸体的头部，检查颈部，注意到了咬痕。她发现这一组咬痕特别之处在于，它们似乎比之前的那些要大。

She put her torch down next to her as Rei switched the light on in the room. It was a lone light providing a small amount of illumination and lighting up the cobwebs a dull orange. Asuka shuddered as she saw a group of spiders converging and dying in the corner of the room.  
她把电筒放在身边，与此同时，绫波打开了房间的灯。一盏孤灯提供了微弱的光亮，照亮了蜘蛛网，呈现出暗橙色。明日香看到一群蜘蛛在房间角落聚集并死去，不禁打了个寒颤。

Getting up, she made her way over to another mound underneath the webbing. Assuming it was another body she immediately began to tear some of the webbing away when the lone light in the room suddenly shut itself off, along with all the torches.  
她站起身，走向另一处被蛛网覆盖的土堆。以为又是一具尸体，她立刻开始撕开蛛网，就在这时，房间里唯一的那盏灯突然熄灭了，连同所有的火把一起。

Asuka swore. 明日香咒骂了一声。

"Shit, could that thing still be inside here?"  
“该死，那东西不会还在里面吧？”

There was a brief moment of silence as Rei walked over towards the window and looked out across the city.  
短暂的沉默后，绫波零走向窗边，俯瞰着整个城市。

"The power has gone out across the entire city. It would be logical to assume the power outage has nothing to do with our case."  
“整个城市的电力都中断了。按理说，这次停电应该与我们的案件无关。”

Asuka nodded, Shinji however shook his head and looked out across the darkened cityscape.  
明日香点点头，而真嗣却摇了摇头，凝视着黑暗的城市景观。

"No, this is related, it might not have been our guy who did it, but I'm sure it's related. It's too convenient." he said.  
“不，这肯定有关联，虽然不一定是我们的目标所为，但我确信这与我们有关。这太巧合了。”他说。

"Maybe you're getting a bit too paranoid there, Shinji. Who would want to do something like this?"  
“也许你有点过于多疑了，真嗣。谁会想做这种事呢？”

"Sohryu is right, we should get to our next location. Our cell phones do not appear to be working either." Rei nodded.  
“丽说得对，我们应该前往下一个地点。我们的手机似乎也失灵了。”丽点头道。

Asuka was surprised to hear Rei agreeing with her, she exchanged glances with Shinji and waited until Rei had left the room before whispering to Shinji.  
听到丽赞同自己，明日香感到惊讶，她和真嗣交换了一个眼神，等到丽离开房间后，才低声对真嗣说。

"Keep it to yourself for now, I think you're right but if someone did trigger this, then they could be watching us."  
"暂时保密，我觉得你是对的，但如果有人触发了这个，那么他们可能正在监视我们。"

"What you believe..." Shinji started to blurt out before Asuka stopped him.  
""你所相信的……"" 真嗣刚要脱口而出，就被明日香打断了。

"I was there when we met Spender you know, and you're right, it is too convenient."  
"我们遇见斯宾德时我也在场，你知道的，你说得对，这确实太巧合了。"

**Director's Office – 2030 hours  
局长办公室 – 晚上 20:30**

"The entire city is without power, most electrical devices don't appear to be working either. Cell phones appear to be none functional and traffic is at a complete standstill."  
整个城市都停电了，大多数电子设备似乎也无法工作。手机似乎都失灵了，交通完全陷入停滞。

Gendo lit the candle in front of him and looked across at Fuyutsuki, a stern expression on his face.  
源渡点燃了面前的蜡烛，严肃地看向冬月。

"What about the backup generators?"  
"备用发电机呢？"

"Someone cut the fuses, tomorrow we will sweep the building and look for any sign of an intruder. It would seem this blackout was planned, whoever is responsible knew exactly what they were doing. Perhaps we should begin a search for the culprit?" The elder man suggested.  
"有人切断了保险丝，明天我们会彻底搜查大楼，寻找任何入侵者的迹象。看来这次停电是预谋好的，幕后之人清楚自己在做什么。也许我们应该开始寻找罪魁祸首了？" 年长者提议道。"

"Searching the building is unnecessary" Gendo answered "Whoever was responsible will have already gotten what they were looking for and will be gone by now."  
"搜查大楼没有必要" 源渡回答 "无论谁是幕后黑手，他们已经得到了想要的东西，现在肯定已经离开了。"

"That might be so, but taking out an entire cities power to find one thing in this building. It's a bit extreme don't you think?"  
"或许是这样，但为了在这栋楼里找到一样东西而切断整个城市的电力，你不觉得有点过激吗？"

"Some people will go to extreme lengths to get what they want, humanity is a strange creature professor."  
"有些人为了达到目的会不择手段，人类真是一种奇怪的生物，教授。"

"Perhaps you're right. I am concerned though, as it stands, we are completely defenseless and there is an Angel in Tokyo 3. If that was to get inside NERV it could jeopardize everything."  
"也许你是对的。不过我确实担心，目前我们完全处于无防备状态，而东京 3 区有一只使徒。如果它进入 NERV，可能会危及一切。"

"The Angel has limited intelligence and is acting on instinct, the three Eva's are currently tracking it down and will exterminate it soon."  
"天使的智力有限，目前仅凭本能行动，三台 EVA 正在追踪并很快将消灭它。"

Fuyutsuki's eyes widened at the words, they sent a chill down his spine. He took a seat on one of the sides of the room and replied curtly.  
听到这些话，冬月眼神一紧，一股寒意直透脊背。他在房间一侧坐下，简短地回应道。

"Extermination, sounds like something you'd do to an insect, not something that is human."  
"消灭，听起来像是针对昆虫的做法，而非对待人类的事物。"

Gendo quickly replied almost as if he was correcting the old man.  
源度迅速回应，几乎像是在纠正那位老人。

"It was human, but the Angels are no longer human. Some may appear so, but they are so far beyond humanity, they are a new species. They are the joining of one species with another and bred for a specific purpose. They are living experiments whose time is running out. We, the creators, are the ones who hold the true power."  
“它们曾经是人类，但使徒已不再是人类。有些可能看似如此，但它们远远超越了人类，是一种全新的物种。它们是两种物种的结合体，为特定目的而培育。它们是时间所剩无几的活体实验。我们，作为创造者，才是掌握真正力量的人。”

"Even so, they are still dangerous and some have knowledge of what we have done. If one was to get into NERV it could spell the end."  
“即便如此，它们仍然危险，且有些知晓我们所做之事。如果有一个使徒潜入 NERV，那将意味着末日的来临。”

"That's why we have all three Eva's under our control." Ikari Said.  
"这就是为什么我们能控制所有三台 EVA。" 碇司令说道。

"But how long will they be under our control though?" Fuyutski questioned.  
"但它们能受我们控制多久呢？" 冬月副司令质疑道。

Gendo brought his hands down onto the table and smiled knowingly, "As long as we need them to be, I have instructed Rei of what to do if there are any problems with Unit One or Two. We are the ones with the control, do not let Keel's antics trouble you Fuyutsuki, his attempts to gain their trust will go unrewarded."  
碇源堂将双手按在桌上，带着深意的微笑说："只要我们需要，我已经指示绫波在零号机或二号机出现问题时该如何应对。控制权在我们手中，别让基尔的伎俩困扰你，冬月，他试图赢得 EVA 信任的努力将是徒劳的。"

Fuyutsuki turned to look at the image of the tree of life on the floor, he had never really understood Gendo's fondness for the image, yet it had always been present since the time he worked at GEHIRN with him. There was a strange sort of arrogance to him as well, yet the words he spoke rang true, with the Evangelions within NERV there was hardly any risk. But still, he couldn't help but feel some concern for both Shinji and Asuka, knowing what was to come and what their true nature was.  
冬月转向看着地板上生命之树的图像，他从未真正理解过碇对这图像的偏爱，但从他在 GEHIRN 与碇共事时起，它就一直存在。他也有一种奇怪的傲慢，然而他所说的话却真实可信，在 NERV 内的 EVA 几乎没有任何风险。但尽管如此，他还是忍不住为真嗣和明日香感到担忧，知道即将发生的事情以及他们的真实本质。

'_It is for a better future though, isn't it?'_  
'尽管如此，这是为了一个更好的未来，不是吗？'

**NERV Offices – 2045 hours  
NERV 办公室 – 晚上 20 点 45 分**

Misato lay her head down on the desk, resting uncomfortably on the folders and looking into the flickering flame in front of her. She had always questioned why she felt a need to keep a few candles in her desk drawer and tonight seemed to provide the perfect answer to that question. Early reports from other people she had spoke to who were also working late seemed to suggest a complete power outage across the entire city and also other electronic devices seemed to stop working as well.  
美里将头枕在桌上的文件夹上，不舒服地休息着，目光投向面前摇曳的烛火。她一直疑惑为何要在抽屉里留几根蜡烛，今晚似乎给出了完美的答案。她从其他同样加班的人那里得到的初步报告似乎表明，整个城市都遭遇了全面停电，连其他电子设备也停止了工作。

Her thoughts drifted to Shinji and the other two Agents with him and she began to worry slightly. It was perhaps paranoia on her part, but she couldn't help but feel this power outage wasn't an accident.  
她的思绪飘向了真嗣和其他两位与他同行的特工，心中不禁略感担忧。或许是她多虑了，但她无法抑制地觉得这次停电并非偶然。

'_Come on Misato stop thinking like that, it's just one of those things. It's not like it's another Impact Incident'_  
'好了，美里，别再那样想了，这只是偶然事件。又不是另一次冲击事件。'

She raised her head and looked out at the darkened skyline and up at the stars above, it was an amazing sight, something she had never noticed before. Millions of stars all twinkling, slightly seeming to stretch out into infinity, it was a beauty she would never have noticed had it not been at the expense of the city wide blackout. A strange thought began to cross her mind as she looked out at the expanse.  
她抬起头，望向昏暗的天际线，仰视着上方的星空，这是一幅她从未留意过的惊人景象。无数星星闪烁着，仿佛微微延伸至无限远处，若非全市大停电，她绝不会注意到这般美景。凝视着这片浩瀚，一个奇异的念头开始掠过她的脑海。

'_What if Shinji's right, what if we aren't alone?'_  
'如果真嗣是对的，如果我们并不孤单呢？'

Smiling slightly she swept the thought away, she still didn't think it could be possible. As much as she supported Shinji and his work she was still skeptical, perhaps not to the same level as Asuka but she still needed some sort of proof. She sighed as she went back to her desk, just as she sat down, her office door began to open slightly. Watching quietly as a figure entered the room she stood up, ready to pounce on the person until she realized who it was.  
她微微一笑，将这个念头抛诸脑后，她依然认为这不太可能。尽管她支持真嗣和他的工作，但她仍持怀疑态度，或许不及明日香那般强烈，但她仍需要某种证据。她叹了口气，回到桌前坐下，就在这时，办公室的门微微开启。她静静地注视着一个人影进入房间，站起身准备扑向对方，直到她认出那是谁。

"You idiot, haven't you ever heard of knocking before entering."  
"你这个笨蛋，难道不知道进门之前要敲门吗？"

In the dim light she was sure she could see Kaji grinning slightly.  
在昏暗的光线下，她确信自己能看到加持微微咧嘴笑的样子。

"Sorry, thought I'd surprise you."  
"抱歉，想给你个惊喜。"

"Well you did achieve that, how come you're working so late?"  
"你确实做到了，怎么还工作到这么晚？"

"I had a meeting, and what about yourself?"  
"我刚开完会，你呢？"

"I'm waiting for news from my Agents on this case they're working on." She paused for a moment and then continued, "Kaji, can I ask you something?"  
"我在等我的代理人们关于这个案子的消息。" 她顿了一下，然后继续说，"加持，我能问你个问题吗？"

"Of course you can." "当然可以。"

Misato stood up and looked out her window at the darkened city, the few candles inside the room illuminating the two of them both slightly.  
美里站起身，望向窗外被夜色笼罩的城市，房间内仅有的几支蜡烛微弱地照亮了他们两人。

"What is the Evangelion project?"  
"什么是 EVA 计划？"

Kaji was actually glad the room was in full darkness, just so Misato could not see his reaction to the question. He moved over to the door making sure it was closed properly, before moving over towards Misato.  
加治其实很庆幸房间里一片漆黑，这样美里就看不到他对这个问题的反应了。他走到门边，确保门关好了，才朝美里走去。

"I've never heard of it." he answered abruptly.  
“我从没听说过。”他生硬地回答。

Misato knew he was feigning ignorance. She could tell the name was, on some level, at least familiar to him.  
美里知道他在装傻。她能感觉到这个名字至少在某种程度上对他来说是熟悉的。

"Don't give me that, I know that you know more than you're letting on, Kaji."  
"别跟我来这套，我知道你隐瞒了不少，加持。"

"You're right, but what makes you think I know what you're talking about?"  
"你说得对，但你怎么就认为我知道你在说什么呢？"

"You knew who Shinji's father was," Misato said "You knew just the right time to leave the Over The Rainbow and you knew about those twins. I wouldn't be surprised if you knew about this one as well."  
"你知道真嗣的父亲是谁，""美里说，""你恰好知道离开‘彩虹之上’的时机，还知道那对双胞胎的事。如果连这个你也知道，我一点都不会惊讶。"

"You're playing a dangerous game Misato." Kaji warned. "There are powers who w..."  
"美里，你在玩一场危险的游戏。" 加持警告道。"有些势力..."

"Dangerous or not, I'm Shinji's direct superior and have a right to know if one of my agents is in danger."  
"无论危不危险，我是真嗣的直接上级，有权知道我的手下是否处于危险之中。"

"He's not in danger," The unshaven man assured her. "In fact, he along with Asuka and Rei are probably the safest of all of us when it comes to what they're against."  
"他并没有危险，" 这位胡子拉碴的男人向她保证。"实际上，他和明日香、绫波可能是我们所有人中最安全的，尤其是面对他们所对抗的东西。"

"So you _do_ know something?"  
"所以你确实知道些什么？"

"That depends, how much do you know already?"  
"那得看你已经知道多少了？"

"I know that both Shinji and Asuka are part of something called Project Evangelion. I know that it has something do with things called Angels. I know Shinji's father is involved and I suspect NERV is involved somehow."  
"我知道真嗣和明日香都参与了一个叫‘福音计划’的项目。我知道它与被称为‘使徒’的东西有关。我知道真嗣的父亲也牵涉其中，并且我怀疑 NERV 组织也与此有关。"

Kaji frowned, it was not the answer he had expected from her and severely limited his options on a response.  
加治皱起眉头，这不是他预料中的回答，严重限制了他回应的选择。

"I see. How did you come to know this?"  
“我明白了。你是怎么知道这些的？”

"Cut the crap Kaji, just tell me what I want to know or get out."  
“别废话了，加治，直接告诉我我想知道的，否则就滚开。”

"If I tell you all of what I know they'll kill us both."  
"如果我告诉你我所知道的一切，他们会杀了我们两个。"

Misato turned her back on him and moved back over to the window, glancing out at the city.  
美里转过身去，回到窗边，瞥了一眼城市。

"In that case get out." she growled.  
"那样的话，滚出去。"她咆哮道。

Kaji swallowed a lump in his throat, the words slowly snaking their way up his throat.  
加治咽了咽口水，话语缓缓地从喉咙里爬上来。

"Genetically enhanced soldiers" he blurted out.  
“基因改造士兵”他脱口而出。

"What did you say?" "你说什么？"

"The Angels, that's what they are. Genetically enhanced soldiers, bred for a specific purpose."  
“使徒，这就是他们的身份。基因改造士兵，为特定目的而培育。”

"What purpose?" "有何目的？"

"That I don't know." "这一点我不清楚。"

Misato knew he was being truthful about this at least.  
至少，美里知道他在这件事上是诚实的。

"How is NERV involved?" she questioned.  
"NERV 是如何参与其中的？" 她问道。

"They supply the means to defeat the Angels."  
"他们提供了击败使徒的手段。"

"You mean the Evangelions don't you? That's Shinji, Asuka and Rei."  
"你是说 EVA 吧？就是真嗣、明日香和绫波。"

"Correct." "没错。"

"Why though, why NERV and why those three?"  
"为什么呢，为什么是 NERV，为什么是他们三个？"

"Shinji was chosen because of his father and his father's link with GEHIRN. That's all I know…"  
"真嗣被选中是因为他的父亲以及他父亲与 GEHIRN 的联系。我就知道这么多……"

Misato quickly stopped him.  
美里迅速制止了他。

"GEHIRN, I thought they were dissolved fifteen years ago after their main laboratory was destroyed in old Tokyo. My own father was a scientist there, it was a medical research facility, what do they have to do with this and Shinji's father?"  
"GEHIRN，我以为他们在十五年前就解散了，当时他们的主要实验室在旧东京被毁。我父亲曾是那里的科学家，那是一个医学研究机构，他们与这和真嗣的父亲有什么关系？"

"Shinji's father was an advisor there up until the impact incident, Shinji's mother worked there as well, up until she died a few years prior to impact."  
"真嗣的父亲在那次撞击事件之前一直是那里的顾问，真嗣的母亲也在那里工作，直到她几年前去世。"

"What does this have to do with the Angels?"  
"这与使徒有什么关系？"

"GEHIRN are responsible for part of them, they were conducting research into human genetics and were being funded."  
"GEHIRN 负责其中一部分，他们在进行人类基因研究，并获得了资金支持。"

"Funded by who?" "谁资助的？"

"The same people who would kill me for telling you this information."  
"就是那些会因为我告诉你这些信息而杀了我的人。"

"Who are they?" “他们是谁？”

"I don't know, but they're powerful, they've been active for over twenty years. They have ties to government agencies all over the world, even NERV."  
“我不知道，但他们势力强大，活跃了超过二十年。他们与世界各地的政府机构都有联系，甚至包括 NERV。”

Misato looked on in shock, hoping somehow Kaji would be joking, she examined his face. He wasn't, the usual grin he wore had gone but was now replaced with a deadly serious expression. Their eyes met for a brief moment as they both stood in silence, Kaji turned his head towards the window and looked out across the darkness. He turned back to Misato and spoke softly.  
美里震惊地看着，希望 somehow 加持会是在开玩笑，她审视着他的脸。他没有，他平时常挂的笑容消失了，取而代之的是一种极其严肃的表情。他们的目光短暂交汇，两人静静地站在那里，加持转向窗户，望向窗外的黑暗。他转回身，轻声对美里说。

"I should be going." "我该走了。"

He opened the door quietly, leaving Misato to contemplate what she had just heard, before he was able to leave however he heard her calling him back.  
他轻轻地打开门，留下美里独自沉思她刚刚听到的话，然而在他离开之前，他听到她叫他回来。

"Kaji…when I hear back from Shinji do you want to go out for a few drinks?"  
"加持…等我收到真嗣的消息，你想出去喝几杯吗？"

"Sounds good to me, where at?"  
"听起来不错，去哪儿？"

"I'll contact you, I know a few good places around here."  
"我会联系你，我知道这附近有几个不错的地方。"

He nodded and left the room, Misato lay her head back down on the desk and spoke to herself.  
他点点头离开了房间，美里将头重新靠在桌子上，自言自语道。

"GEHIRN, The Impact Incident, my father…Am I…part of this too?"  
"GEHIRN，冲击事件，我的父亲……我也是这其中的一部分吗？"

**Abandoned Warehouse – 2115 hours  
废弃仓库 – 2115 小时**

"Agent Sohryu, where are you taking us?"  
"苏里尤探员，你要带我们去哪里？"

Shinji glanced up at the mesh fence in front of them and watched Asuka climb over it easily and land on the other side. He looked up at the building in front of him, it was an old warehouse, a short walk from their previous location. Around the windows on top he could make out the vague outlines of cobwebs. Immediately he began to climb the fence, slowly followed by Rei. As he got to the top he noticed that there were thin streams of light coming from inside the warehouse.  
真嗣抬头看向面前的铁丝网，只见明日香轻松地翻越过去，稳稳落在另一侧。他转头望向眼前的建筑，那是一座旧仓库，离他们先前的位置只有几步之遥。环绕着顶楼的窗户，他隐约能看到蜘蛛网的轮廓。他立刻开始攀爬栅栏，绫波紧随其后。当他爬到顶端时，注意到仓库内部透出几缕微弱的光线。

"It's in here." Shinji said.  
“在里面。”真嗣说道。

Asuka nodded slightly, "Yes, I know."  
明日香微微点头，“是的，我知道。”

"How did you know it was here?"  
“你怎么知道它在这里？”

She turned to him and smiled knowingly, "I'm just that good, I guess."  
她转向他，心领神会地笑了笑，“我想，我就是这么厉害吧。”

Without giving him a chance to reply she began to make her way over to the warehouse to try to find an entrance. She got halfway across the tarmac area before a sudden pain stabbed at her head. She continued walking, trying to ignore it, but it still lingered. She turned around, trying to make sure she was out of view before bringing her hand up to her head. As she did so she felt something flash before her, she could see a strange distorted image in front of her.  
没等他回答，她就开始朝仓库走去，试图找到入口。她走到停机坪一半的地方时，突然一阵剧痛袭上她的头部。她继续前行，试图忽视这痛楚，但它依旧挥之不去。她转过身，确保自己不在视线范围内，然后抬起手按住头部。就在这时，她感觉到眼前一闪，眼前出现了一个奇怪的扭曲影像。

The pain had subsided but was now replaced by another feeling, a strange floating sensation, almost as if she wasn't there. Looking around, she realized where she was. She was somehow inside the warehouse. It was a two tier warehouse with various size boxes scattered around, simply dumped by the previous owner. Steel staircases and ladders lead up to a platform going all around the warehouse and a set of offices towards the back.  
疼痛已经消退，取而代之的是一种奇怪的漂浮感，仿佛她并不存在。环顾四周，她意识到自己在哪里。她不知怎么地进入了仓库。这是一个两层的仓库，散落着各种大小的箱子，显然是被前任主人随意丢弃的。钢制楼梯和梯子通向环绕整个仓库的平台，以及后面的一排办公室。

Several huge white bags hung from various areas, Asuka could count about twelve of them in total before she spotted something moving towards the center of the floor. Her heart began pounding as the thing stood still for a few moments. It was a squat spider like creature, Asuka could see only traces of human within it as it was covered in a hideous black slimy skin. It was crouched on all fours, its head tilted slightly as it looked around the room, it's eyes were surrounded by thick orange liquid, beneath which appeared to be more smaller eyes.  
几个巨大的白色袋子悬挂在不同区域，明日香大约数了十二个，然后她注意到有什么东西向地板中央移动。她的心跳开始加速，那东西静止了一会儿。它是一个矮小的蜘蛛状生物，明日香只能看到它体内隐约的人类痕迹，因为它被一层丑陋的黑色粘滑皮肤覆盖。它四肢着地蹲伏着，头部微微倾斜，环视着房间，它的眼睛被厚厚的橙色液体包围，下面似乎还有更多的小眼睛。

The pain suddenly returned as the creature seemed to look directly at her, she felt a presence behind her and closed her eyes tightly, trying to will the pain away. She could hear the echoes of a voice floating around her, it got louder and clearer until she heard it from directly behind her. She felt Shinji's presence behind her, his arm wrapped around her shoulder, asking if she was alright.  
那痛苦突然间又回来了，当那生物似乎直接看向她时，她感觉到身后有股存在感，紧紧闭上了眼睛，试图用意志力驱散疼痛。她能听到一个声音在她周围回荡，越来越响亮、越来越清晰，直到她从正后方听到它。她感觉到真嗣就在她身后，他的手臂环绕在她的肩膀上，询问她是否还好。

Blinking twice, she looked around and realized she was on her knees clutching her head, she felt herself going slightly red in embarrassment and quickly stood up, pushing Shinji away slightly. She snapped back, trying to assure them and herself she was fine.  
眨了两下眼，她环顾四周，意识到自己正跪在地上抱着头，她感到自己的脸因尴尬而微微泛红，迅速站起身来，轻轻推开真嗣。她急忙回应，试图向他们和自己保证她没事。

"I'm fine, it was nothing. I was just checking something."  
“我没事，没什么大不了的。我只是检查一下。”

Her eyes met Rei's for a moment and she felt a wave of nausea sweep through her, she forced herself to swallow the sickness down and looked away from Rei.  
她的目光与真对视了一瞬，随即感到一阵恶心涌上心头，她强迫自己咽下这股不适，移开了视线。

"Lets go, it's in there."  
“我们走吧，就在里面。”

She began to walk away but Shinji stopped her. "Wait…"  
她正要离开，但真嗣拦住了她。“等等……”

Impatiently, she turned around to face him, he was looking up at the warehouse window. She questioned him sharply, "What is it?"  
她不耐烦地转过身面对他，他正抬头望着仓库的窗户。她尖锐地问道：“那是什么？”

"If that thing is in there, we can't just storm in and attack it, just in case it is what we suspect it to be. It's going to be fast, we know it has some form of acid within it, if all three of us just rush in we're going to get killed." he said.  
“如果那东西在里面，我们不能贸然冲进去攻击它，万一它真是我们怀疑的那种东西。它速度很快，我们知道它体内含有某种酸液，如果我们三个人一起冲进去，只会送命。”他说道。

"So what do you suggest?"  
“那你有什么建议？”

"I don't know yet, I'm thinking."  
"我还不知道，我正在考虑。"

Irritated, she then turned to Rei,  
她有些恼火，然后转向丽，

"And what about you Wondergirl, surely you'll have something?"  
"那你呢，奇迹少女，你肯定有什么想法吧？"

"Agent Ikari is right, we do not know the layout of the warehouse which makes it slightly harder."  
碇参事说得对，我们并不熟悉仓库的布局，这使得任务稍微困难一些。

Asuka stopped to think for a few moments until she remembered what she had just seen previously. She pointed towards the back of the warehouse, speaking quietly to the other two Agents.  
明日香停下思考了一会儿，直到她回想起之前看到的情景。她指向仓库的后方，轻声对另外两名特工说道。

"It's a big open area, an upper area and a lower area, a series of offices towards the back of the upper area and several small rooms towards the back."  
那里是一个开阔的大区域，分为上下两层，上层后方有一系列办公室，而下层后方则有几个小房间。

She turned to them both secretly hoping they wouldn't question how she knew, she wasn't even sure what had just happened herself. Shinji looked at her quizzically, he was about to ask how she knew but decided to wait until a better time, after all her hunch had paid off this far. Instead he questioned her about the entrance to the warehouse.  
她转向他们俩，暗自希望他们不会追问她是怎么知道的，她自己也不确定刚刚发生了什么。真嗣疑惑地看着她，正要问她是怎么知道的，但决定等到更合适的时机，毕竟她的直觉到目前为止都得到了验证。相反，他询问她关于仓库入口的情况。

"That must mean there's another entrance towards the back, probably leading up to the upper levels as well."  
“那一定意味着后面还有另一个入口，可能还通向上层。”

"Probably, I didn't see that part."  
“可能吧，我没看到那部分。”

Asuka immediately cursed herself after saying that last statement, she tried to see the reactions of the other two Agents. Rei appeared to either not hear the comment or was just ignoring it. Her eyes then met Shinji's, he didn't say anything but Asuka could tell he wanted too. The strangest thing was he was looking at her understandingly, almost as if he had seen the same thing or had had a similar experience. She decided it would probably be a good idea to change the subject quickly, before she made herself look even weirder.  
说出那句话后，明日香立刻在心里咒骂自己，她试图观察另外两位特工的反应。绫波似乎要么没听到那句话，要么就是故意无视。接着，她的目光与真嗣相遇，他什么也没说，但明日香能感觉到他其实想说些什么。最奇怪的是，他正以一种理解的眼神看着她，仿佛他也见过同样的事情或有过类似的经历。她决定最好尽快换个话题，以免让自己看起来更奇怪。

'_Gott, if I keep this up I'm going to end up looking as weird as Shinji. I know what I saw, though even if they don't believe me I know I'm right.'_  
'天哪，如果我继续这样下去，我会变得和真嗣一样奇怪。我知道我看到了什么，即使他们不相信我，我也知道我是对的。'

Turning back towards the building, she withdrew her pistol and knelt down, checking for her torch. As she was doing this she was giving out instructions to the other two Agents.  
她转身面向建筑物，拔出手枪并跪下，检查她的手电筒。在此过程中，她向另外两位特工下达指令。

"Ok I've got an idea Ikari, you and Ayanami go round the back and check for another entrance. Once you find it, enter through the backway. Be as quiet as possible. One of you try to find a way up onto the upper level and stay hidden and in position until I give the signal."  
“好，我有主意了，碇，你和绫波绕到后面去检查是否有其他入口。一旦找到，就从后门进入。尽量保持安静。你们中的一位设法找到通往上一层的路，并保持隐蔽，直到我发出信号。”

Rei turned to her replying quietly, seemingly scared at what they were about to face, "What if we encounter the being?"  
绫波转向她，轻声回答，似乎对即将面对的情况感到害怕，“如果我们遇到那个存在怎么办？”

"You won't, it'll be in the main area of the warehouse." She paused for a moment and then quickly tried to cover up her mistake, "In case you do though, unload everything you have into it."  
“你们不会遇到的，它会在仓库的主要区域。”她停顿了一下，然后迅速试图掩盖她的错误，“不过万一你们真的遇到了，就把所有能用的都用上对付它。”

"I see. What will the signal be?"  
"我明白了。信号会是什么？"

"Me firing a bullet into it, hopefully killing it. Once you hear that, attack it, we'll attack from three separate locations to try to confuse it."  
"我朝它开枪，希望把它干掉。一旦你听到枪声，就发起攻击，我们将从三个不同的位置进攻，试图迷惑它。"

Rei began to move off towards the back of the warehouse without waiting for Shinji, Asuka was about to start moving when Shinji stopped her.  
丽开始向仓库后方移动，没有等真嗣，明日香正要开始行动时，真嗣拦住了她。

"What will you be doing?"  
"你打算做什么？"

"I'm heading in the front entrance."  
"我正要从正门进去。"

He stepped back slightly, a shocked expression came over him, he stuttered out.  
他微微后退，脸上露出震惊的表情，结结巴巴地说道。

"You're entering the front way, but if it's there you'll be killed. It's too dangerous."  
"你正从正面进入，但如果那东西在那儿，你会被杀死的。太危险了。"

She snapped back at him, "I don't need you to tell me what's dangerous or if I'll be killed, I know it's risky but it's the only chance we have. Besides, do you think I'm that stupid I'll let some overgrown spider kill me?"  
她厉声回敬他，"我不需要你告诉我什么是危险的或者我会不会被杀，我知道这很冒险，但这是我们唯一的机会。再说了，你以为我那么蠢，会让一只大蜘蛛干掉我吗？"

"N-No, but…" Shinji stuttered.  
"不-不是，但是…" 真嗣结巴道。

He couldn't think of anything else to say, instead he brought his hand up to her shoulder and looked into her eyes.  
他一时想不出还有什么可说的，只是将手搭在她的肩上，凝视着她的眼睛。

"Just…be careful." “只是……小心点。”

She pulled his hand off her shoulder, still sounding quite angry at him, "I'll be fine, just go to where you need to be, Ayanami will be waiting. "  
她甩开他的手，语气依旧带着怒意，“我会没事的，你快去该去的地方吧，绫波还在等你。”

He nodded and began moving towards the back of the warehouse, leaving Asuka standing alone, looking up at the warehouse windows. Once she was sure he was out of ear shot she whispered to herself.  
他点点头，开始向仓库后方移动，留下明日香独自站在那里，抬头望着仓库的窗户。一旦确定他已经听不见了，她便低声自语道。

"Be careful Shinji." “小心点，真嗣。”

医疗实验室 – 晚上九点十五分**

Blood, that's what it looked like, what it smelt like and Ritsuko presumed it's what it tasted like. She sealed off the vial and placed it inside her case, next to the other vials inside. Each vial carefully labeled with only a set of initials, in the dim torchlight she checked each one was in place next to their respective initials, Vial One lined up with S.I, Vial Two lined up with A.L.S and vial three lined up with R.A. She shut the case and shuddered as the thought of what she was doing swept over her, she tried to force it out of her mind, reminding herself of why she was doing this.  
血，这就是它看起来的样子，闻起来的味道，而理津子猜测它尝起来也是这样。她封好试管，将其放入箱中，旁边是其他试管。每个试管都只标有一组首字母，在昏暗的手电筒光下，她检查每个试管是否都与其对应的首字母排列整齐，一号试管对应 S.I，二号试管对应 A.L.S，三号试管对应 R.A。她合上箱子，想到自己正在做的事情，不禁打了个寒颤，她试图将这个念头赶出脑海，提醒自己为什么要这么做。

'_It's for the greater good Ritsuko, it's not about what they will become but about what they can do for humanity.'_  
'这是为了更大的利益，理津子，这无关他们将成为什么，而是他们能为人类做什么。'

She got up off her seat, adjusting her lab coat and taking hold of the case. Throughout the building she could hear the sound of the doctors and other scientists walking around and talking about the blackout. Slowly she began moving towards the door, trying to plot the quickest way out of the building so as to not attract any unwanted attention. She had little time to get to her destination and didn't want to be slowed down.  
她从座位上站起来，调整了一下实验服，抓住了箱子。整栋楼里，她能听到医生和其他科学家走来走去，谈论着停电的事。她慢慢地开始向门口移动，试图规划出最快的离开路线，以免引起不必要的注意。她几乎没有时间到达目的地，不想被拖慢脚步。

Just as Ritsuko was about to start making her way out of the room the door opened suddenly. She shone her torch only to see Misato standing at the entrance to the room, lowering the case, she smiled.  
正当律子准备离开房间时，门突然打开了。她用手电筒一照，只见美里站在门口，放下手中的箱子，微笑着。

"Good evening Misato, you're the last person I expected to see here."  
“晚上好，美里，我没想到会在这里见到你。”

"Funnily enough you're the first person I expected to see here," Misato remarked. Although seems you're heading off somewhere. I wanted to know what you found regarding the body brought in the other day, the one with the shell."  
“说来也巧，你是我第一个想到会在这里见到的人，”美里说道，“不过看来你要去别的地方。我想知道你前几天带回来的那具尸体，就是那个带着壳的，有什么发现。”

"It's in my report, unfortunately it's on the computer over there." She pointed at the Magi system set up in the corner as she spoke. "So I can't really show it to you."  
"不幸的是，它在我的报告里，但报告在那边的电脑上。" 她边说边指向角落里设置的 Magi 系统。"所以我没法给你看。"

"That's fine, I just want to know the basics of what you found."  
"没关系，我只想了解一下你发现的基本情况。"

"Like what?" "比如呢？"

"Was it human?" "那是人类吗？"

"An unusual question. Yes it was human. _Was_ being the operative word, something had altered it to be like that. If you'll excuse me I have to go."  
“一个不寻常的问题。是的，它曾经是人类。‘曾经’是关键词，某种东西改变了它，使它变成了那样。请原谅，我得走了。”

She stood up with the case but was stopped when Misato's cell phone started ringing. She looked at it in shock, having previously thought it had stopped working during the black out. She answered it but before she got a chance to speak Kaji's voice came across.  
她带着箱子站起身，却被美里手机响起的铃声拦住了。她震惊地看着手机，之前还以为在停电期间它已经失灵了。她接起电话，还没来得及说话，就听到了加持的声音。

"_Katsuragi, all three Agents are in danger. There's an abandoned warehouse not too far from here you need to get there as soon as possible, if Ritsuko is with you take her too. Sorry I can't tell you more, it's important you get there as soon as possible though."_  
“葛城，三名特工都处于危险之中。离这里不远有一个废弃的仓库，你必须尽快赶到那里，如果律子在你身边，也带上她。抱歉我不能告诉你更多，但你们必须尽快赶到。”

**Abandoned Warehouse – 2125 hours  
废弃仓库 – 晚上 21:25**

Upper Area 上层区域

Rei climbed up the ladder and entered the small office area, she switched on her torch and resisted the urge to scream out as she saw various cobwebs, each occupied by various spiders. She moved towards one of the doors and saw it covered in cobwebs and shuddered, she focused slightly and there was a brief flash of light as she used her A.T. Field to sweep them out of the way of the door. She entered the small office, only to find it empty, she reached into her jacket and readied her gun. At the front of the office was a small window, through it she could see the rest of the warehouse. Several small cobwebbed sacks hung from the ceiling.  
丽爬上梯子，进入狭小的办公区，她打开手电筒，强忍住尖叫的冲动，因为看到了各种布满蜘蛛网的角落，每张网中都有蜘蛛。她走向其中一扇门，发现门上满是蜘蛛网，不禁打了个寒颤。她集中精神，一道短暂的光芒闪过，她用 A.T.力场将蜘蛛网扫开，以便打开门。她进入办公室，却发现里面空无一人，她伸手进夹克，准备好了手枪。办公室前方有一扇小窗户，透过窗户她可以看到仓库的其他部分。天花板上悬挂着几个布满蜘蛛网的小袋子。

She moved towards the door and again used her A.T. Field to sweep away the webbing and quietly opened the door, keeping crouched down so as to not attract any unwanted attention. Looking out over the main warehouse area, she saw the main door slightly open, towards the center was the creature, the angel Materiel. It stood crouched, ready to pounce, it's long spindly arms and legs taking up a vast area of the warehouse.  
她向门口走去，再次使用她的 A.T.力场扫除蛛网，并悄无声息地打开门，保持蹲姿以免引起不必要的注意。环顾整个仓库区域，她发现主门微微敞开，中央是那只生物，天使 Materiel。它蹲伏着，准备扑击，其细长的四肢占据了仓库的大片空间。

Rei felt a sickly feeling sweep over her as she watched it moving, breathing deeply, she moved towards one of the staircases and awaited Asuka to make her move.  
看着它移动，丽感到一阵恶心袭来，她深呼吸后向一处楼梯移动，等待明日香采取行动。

Lower Area 下层区域

Shinji watched Rei disappearing up the ladder and readied himself for the walk through the lower offices. Readying his pistol, he made his way over to the doorway and opened it slightly. It opened into a small office area, through the window he could see the main warehouse area. Asuka had been right, he couldn't understand how, but she was correct about the layout.  
真嗣看着丽消失在梯子上，准备好穿过下层办公室的行程。他检查了一下手枪，走向门口，轻轻推开。门后是一个小办公区，透过窗户可以看到主仓库区域。明日香说得没错，他虽然不明白她是怎么知道的，但她对布局的判断是正确的。

He crouched next to the window and looked out. Fear rose within him as he saw the creature sitting in the center of the room. Shinji focused his eyes directly on the doorway, waiting for Asuka to make her entrance. The creature lifted itself up and turned, Shinji saw for the first time exactly what it was. It was grotesque, it's arms and legs morphed into strange spider like limbs, split up, giving it the appearance of having eight.  
他蹲在窗边向外望去。恐惧在他心中升起，因为他看到那怪物正坐在房间中央。真嗣将目光集中在门口，等待着明日香的进入。怪物站起身来，转了过来，真嗣第一次看清了它的真面目。它丑陋至极，四肢扭曲成类似蜘蛛的奇怪肢体，分裂开来，看上去像是长了八条腿。

It's head was covered in a dark black liquid, LCL trickled around where the monsters eyes would be, running over what appeared to be hundreds more tiny insect eyes. LCL dripped from several wounds within the creature and leaked out more tiny spiders. Shinji stood, transfixed on what it was. It rose on two of its legs and moved towards the door. He reacted immediately, if it stood near to the door it would kill Asuka as soon as she entered, he knew he had to do something. He quickly opened the door and fired a shot at the back of the beast.  
它的头部被一种深黑色的液体覆盖，LCL 在怪物眼睛所在的位置周围流淌，流过似乎是成百上千个更小的昆虫眼睛。LCL 从怪物身上的几处伤口滴落，并渗出更多的小蜘蛛。真嗣站在那里，被眼前的景象所吸引。它用两条腿站立，向门口移动。他立刻反应过来，如果它靠近门口，阿斯卡一进门就会被杀死，他知道自己必须做点什么。他迅速打开门，向怪物的背后开了一枪。

Front Entrance 前门入口

Asuka breathed deeply as she rounded the entrance to the warehouse, she opened the door slightly, taking a look inside. Just as she expected the creature was sitting in the center of the storage area, surrounded by white webbing. Beneath her she could see the smaller spiders running around aimlessly.  
阿斯卡深吸一口气，绕到仓库的入口处，她轻轻推开门，向里面看了一眼。正如她所料，那只怪物正坐在储藏区的中央，被白色的蛛网包围。在她脚下，可以看到小蜘蛛们无目的地四处乱跑。

She pressed her back against the wall and waited for the right moment, from inside she could hear the sounds of the creature moving around. Her stomach knotted as she heard it edge nearer to the door. She readied herself to burst through the door and fire several shots directly into its face when the sound of gunfire echoed throughout the warehouse.  
她将背部紧贴着墙壁，等待着合适的时机，从里面可以听到那怪物四处移动的声音。当它逐渐靠近门口时，她的胃部紧绷。她准备好破门而入，直接向它的脸开几枪，这时枪声在整个仓库中回荡。

She cursed and quickly span back round, opening the door. A few more shots echoed out from above her. She looked up and saw Rei crouched by the staircase, firing wildly at the beast, her eyes wide with fear and hatred for the creature. Asuka ducked behind one of the empty boxes and fired at the beast, trying to make out what it was attacking.  
她咒骂一声，迅速转身，打开门。又有几声枪响从上方传来。她抬头看到丽蹲在楼梯旁，疯狂地向那野兽射击，眼中充满了恐惧和憎恨。明日香躲在一个空箱子后面，向那怪物开枪，试图弄清楚它在攻击什么。

She heard Shinji screaming out as she jumped out from behind the boxes and ran towards the creature, firing rapidly. Asuka watched Shinji as he dropped to his knees after being hit by one of the beast's limbs. Reloading, the beast now turned its focus on her, she approached it and fired, only to be knocked back hard by its fierce blow. It moved over towards her, the deathly stench of blood hovered over the woman, nearly making her sick.  
她听到真嗣的尖叫声，便从箱子后跳出，向那怪物冲去，快速射击。明日香看着真嗣被怪物的一只肢体击中后跪倒在地。怪物重新装弹，现在将注意力转向她，她接近它并开枪，却被它猛烈的一击狠狠击退。它向她移动过来，死亡的血腥气息笼罩着她，几乎让她作呕。

LCL dripped off one of its limbs as it ran it across Asuka's body, she screamed out in pain as the LCL burnt onto her skin. It raised its limb and prepared to finish her off. More gunshots rang out, saving her. The creature focused its attention on the source of the shots, this time it was Rei. She stood with her gun pointed directly at the creature, a bright orange field in front of her. Slowly the spider began moving towards her, yet she stood fast, fearful but still firing.  
LCL 顺着其肢体滴落，当它划过明日香的身躯时，她痛苦地尖叫起来，因为 LCL 灼烧着她的皮肤。它举起肢体，准备终结她。更多的枪声响起，救了她。怪物将注意力转向枪声的来源，这次是绫波。她手持枪械，直指怪物，面前是一片明亮的橙色力场。蜘蛛缓缓向她移动，尽管她站立不动，心中恐惧，但仍持续射击。

The creature raised its limbs and attempted to punch it's way through the field, only to have its limb rebound off of it. Asuka slowly got to her feet and went over to check on Shinji, she turned him over and found him barely conscious, his jacket had been ripped apart from the creatures attack and he was bleeding heavily from his chest and where the LCL had dribbled onto him.  
怪物举起肢体，试图冲破力场，却只是让肢体反弹回来。明日香缓缓站起身，走过去查看真嗣的情况，她将他翻过身来，发现他意识模糊，夹克已被怪物的攻击撕裂，胸口和被 LCL 滴落的地方大量出血。

Anger boiled inside her as she turned to see the creature finally break through Rei's field and send her flying back into the warehouse walls. It spat LCL in Rei's direction, causing her to scream out. Asuka fired a shot at the beast, trying to attract it's attention, it turned towards her and began moving. She quickly ducked out of its way and reloaded her gun again. The beast however did not follow, instead it raised its arms and brought them crashing down on Shinji's chest. The young man screamed out in pain as LCL dripped into from his wounds.  
愤怒在她心中沸腾，当她转身看到那怪物终于突破了丽的力场，将她击飞撞向仓库墙壁。它向丽喷吐 LCL，使她尖叫出声。明日香向那怪物开了一枪，试图吸引它的注意，它转向她并开始移动。她迅速避开它的路径，再次装填枪支。然而，那怪物并未追击，反而举起双臂，猛地砸向真嗣的胸膛。少年痛苦地尖叫，LCL 从他的伤口中滴落。

Asuka felt herself stood frozen as she watched, everything around her seemed to slow down as something else took hold. She ran forward towards the creature firing again, it raised it's limb and tried to attack her only to be met with a similar field to what it encountered against Rei only twice as vast. It hit the field and recoiled in pain. It attempted to break through the field again, only to be met with the same resistance.  
明日香感到自己僵立在原地，目睹这一切，周围的一切似乎都慢了下来，某种力量掌控了她。她冲向那怪物再次开火，它举起肢体试图攻击她，却遭遇了与之前对丽所遇相似的力场，只是范围扩大了一倍。它撞击力场，痛苦地后退。它试图再次突破力场，却遭遇同样的阻力。

Asuka screamed out in rage as she dove directly into the creature, knocking it onto it's back, she stamped on one of its limbs sending LCL spraying everywhere, the pain from the boiling hot LCL only causing her to attack with more force. She found herself no longer firing but now using the butt of the gun to continuously hammer into the creature's skull.  
明日香愤怒地尖叫着，直接扑向那怪物，将其撞翻在地。她用力踩踏其一条肢体，滚烫的 LCL 四处飞溅，剧痛反而使她的攻击更加猛烈。她发现自己不再开枪，而是用枪托不断地猛击怪物的头骨。

Using one of its feet, it kicked itself free and Asuka felt herself flying backwards and landing with a thud on the ground. Swaying slightly, she got to her feet, seeing her own blood trickling to the floor. She span round, seeing the creature rolling around in pain and fired her remaining shots directly into it's skull, killing it. As it died it let out an almighty screech that echoed all around the warehouse, sending chills down her spine. Everything around her was a complete blur as she felt her way to the entrance.  
怪物用一只脚踢开束缚，明日香感到自己向后飞去，重重地摔在地上。她摇摇晃晃地站起身，看到自己的血正缓缓滴落。她转身看到怪物痛苦地翻滚，便将剩余的子弹直接射入其头骨，将其击杀。怪物临死前发出一声震耳欲聋的尖叫，回荡在整个仓库中，令她脊背发凉。周围的一切都变得模糊不清，她摸索着走向入口。

Asuka dropped to her knees, looking directly at the dead creature, her clothes torn and covered in burning LCL. She breathed deeply as she felt her previous rage leaving her, behind her she could hear the voices of both Misato and Ritsuko, who had just arrived at the warehouse. Across from her she could see Rei regaining consciousness and getting to her feet. Slowly, Asuka began to get to her own feet, only to nearly fall backwards, she felt herself falling into something however, turning she looked directly into the face of Shinji.  
明日香双膝一软跪倒在地，直视着那具死去的生物，她的衣服被撕裂，沾满了燃烧的 LCL。她深呼吸着，感觉到之前的愤怒正在消散，身后传来美里和律子刚刚抵达仓库的声音。对面，她看到绫波零正恢复意识，站起身来。明日香缓缓地试图站起来，却几乎向后倒去，她感觉自己正跌入某物之中，转身一看，正好对上了真嗣的脸。

His jacket torn and his white shirt covered in blood from where the creature wounded him, she watched him flinch slightly as he kept her on her feet. They stood there for a few moments, not exchanging any words. He carefully let go of her, allowing her to stand on her own for a while. She stepped away from him, for a moment their eyes never leaving each other, and then she moved back towards him, this time wrapping her arms around him and moving her lips closer to his.  
他的夹克被撕破，白色衬衫上沾满了从怪物造成的伤口流出的血，她看着他微微一颤，稳稳地扶住她。他们就这样静静地站了一会儿，没有说一句话。他小心翼翼地松开手，让她自己站稳。她离开他一步，那一刻他们的目光始终未曾离开对方，然后她又向他走去，这次张开双臂抱住他，将唇瓣贴近他的。

He obliged and moved closer, their lips met as both of them closed their eyes each, entering their own world for a brief moment. Their tongues briefly met each other, as the kiss went on as they stood, oblivious to everyone around them. Eventually Asuka opened her eyes and moved away slowly as both hers and Shinji's eyes locked again.  
他顺从地靠近，两人的唇瓣相触，同时闭上双眼，各自沉浸在那短暂的世界里。他们的舌尖短暂交缠，亲吻持续着，他们站立着，对周围的一切浑然不觉。最终，明日香睁开眼睛，缓缓移开，两人的目光再次交汇。

Immediately she tore herself away from him and looked around, the other three were looking at them. Misato and Ritsuko in complete shock, Rei too appeared to be looking on, quite shocked at what happened. Asuka felt a torrent of emotions run through her, she opened her mouth to speak only to be met with nothing. Shinji spoke, but it registered as barely above a whisper to Asuka.  
她立刻挣脱他，环顾四周，另外三人正看着他们。美里和律子满脸震惊，丽也似乎颇为惊讶地注视着。明日香感到一股情绪的洪流涌过，她张口欲言，却什么也说不出来。真嗣开口了，但他的声音在明日香听来几乎微不可闻。

"Asuka I…" “明日香，我……”

She finally found her voice, and shouted back to him.  
她终于找回了自己的声音，对他大声回喊。

"Don't say anything, what the hell do you think you were doing."  
"别说话，你到底以为自己在干什么。"

She slapped him and pushed her way past him, running out of the warehouse, not sure of what she was doing or where she was anymore. Shinji looked on, shocked, not sure of whether or not to go after her. His question was answered for him when he felt Ritsuko and Misato behind him, Ritsuko spoke, but he couldn't focus on what she was saying, something about poison and an antidote. He felt a needle prick his arm as he faded into unconsciousness.  
她扇了他一巴掌，推开他冲出了仓库，不知道自己在做什么，也不知道自己身在何处。真嗣呆立原地，震惊不已，不确定是否该追上去。他的疑问很快有了答案，当他感觉到身后丽和美里时，丽开口了，但他无法集中注意力听她说了什么，似乎是关于毒药和解药的事。他感到手臂被针刺了一下，随即陷入了昏迷。

### Chapter 15 Reflection

**A/N:** Just to clear things up before anyone asks, the first half of this chapter is being told from Misato's point of view. The scenes afterwards switch back to the traditional third person narration I've been using. The first half is mainly to be read as a report or as if Misato was narrating the chapter itself.  
作者注：在有人提问之前先澄清一下，本章前半部分是以美里视角叙述的。之后的场景将切换回我一直在使用的传统第三人称叙述。前半部分主要应作为报告阅读，或者就像美里在叙述这一章一样。

**Agent Misato Katsuragi – NERV Director of Operations  
特工赤木律子——NERV 作战部主任**

What is humanity? How did we get here? Are we alone? Questions people have been asking for thousands of years. With each passing day they go unanswered and people ask them again and again. There are those that believe the answers already exist, that they're just being hidden from us, hidden behind the metaphorical walls of government and secret organizations. What if the answers to those questions were there though, what if these people are right and the answers were revealed? Would it do us any good or would it simply cause more harm than if we went on living in ignorance as we have been for countless years?  
何为人性？我们如何至此？我们是否孤独？这些问题人们已追问了数千年。日复一日，它们仍未得解答，人们却一再重提。有些人相信答案早已存在，只是被隐藏起来，隐藏在政府和秘密组织的隐喻之墙后。倘若这些问题的答案确实存在，倘若这些人是对的，答案被揭晓了，那会如何？这对我们有益还是只会造成比无知更严重的伤害，就像我们无数年来所做的那样？

At the time of writing this I've been working for NERV for just over thirteen years. I signed up two years after the infamous 'Impact Incident' that destroyed old Tokyo. The incident in which I was the only survivor, the incident which killed my father, left me unable to bear children, the incident that went uninvestigated by the powers that be. It was also the incident that has prompted more conspiracy theories than any other since Roswell in nineteen forty seven. Who can blame people for suspecting something, all reports into it stated it was an explosion at the cities power plant. Eyewitness reports from areas around the city reported flashing lights in the sky, they said it was radiation the theorists said it was Aliens. The reports said it was a tragedy in which millions were killed, the theorists said it was mass abduction.  
在撰写此文之际，我已为 NERV 工作了整整十三年有余。我是在那场臭名昭著的“冲击事件”两年后加入的，那场灾难摧毁了旧东京。我是那次事件中唯一的幸存者，它夺走了我的父亲，使我失去了生育能力，而那些掌权者却对此置若罔闻。自 1947 年罗斯威尔事件以来，它激发的阴谋论比任何其他事件都要多。人们怀疑它，这无可厚非，因为所有关于它的报告都称其为城市发电厂的爆炸。来自城市周边地区的目击者报告称天空中出现了闪光，有人说那是辐射，理论家们则说是外星人。官方报告称这是一场导致数百万人丧生的悲剧，而理论家们则认为这是大规模的绑架事件。

There are some theorists that claim they had contact with alien life before hand, that they or a family member was abducted and returned later or not at all, that the powers that be orchestrated it, that our own government hides the truth from us and that they want to reveal the truth. Reveal to the public that the governments of the world are lying, that there is a conspiracy and that humanity is being lead along by greater forces.  
有些理论家声称他们在此之前曾与外星生命有过接触，他们或其家庭成员被绑架并随后返回或未返回，认为掌权者策划了这一切，我们的政府对我们隐瞒了真相，他们想要揭露真相。向公众揭示世界各国政府在撒谎，存在一个阴谋，人类正被更强大的力量所引导。

I know one of these people, I met him just over ten years ago now. He was a fourteen year old boy, alone. I was just twenty two at the time and had just been made an Agent in NERV. I was working on a case, a child abuse case, and we had just solved it and were in the orphanage and I saw him. He was sitting on his own, looking out the window up at the sky, a saddened look on his face as he listened to some sort of audio device. They told me his name was Shinji Ikari, he had just come in after his uncle who he was staying with had died. His mother had died early in his life and his father abandoned him two years later.  
我认识其中一个人，大约十年前我遇到了他。那时他是个十四岁的男孩，独自一人。当时我二十二岁，刚刚成为 NERV 的特工。我正在处理一个案件，一个儿童虐待案，我们刚刚解决了它，在孤儿院里，我看到了他。他独自坐在那里，望着窗外天空，脸上带着悲伤的表情，听着某种音频设备。他们告诉我他叫碇真嗣，他刚来这里，因为他的叔叔——他当时寄住的人——去世了。他的母亲在他很小的时候就去世了，两年后他的父亲也抛弃了他。

We exchanged glances for a brief moment and there was something about him, maybe it sounds sort of stupid but I felt a connection. Maybe it was because of my own upbringing, my mother divorced my father when I was little and my father had little time for me as I grew up, choosing to dedicate his life to his work. Maybe it was because I had learnt a few months prior of my inability to have children. I enquired about adopting him and because of my status as a NERV Agent, and the state of the country, everything was sorted out within a week. They were hectic times in Japan after the 'Impact', losing one of your major cities leaves a scar on a nation, one that takes time to heal from, and a scar that's still healing to this day.  
我们短暂地交换了一个眼神，他身上有某种东西，或许听起来有点傻，但我感觉到了一种联系。也许是因为我自己的成长经历，我母亲在我很小的时候就和父亲离婚了，而父亲在我成长过程中很少有时间陪伴我，他选择将一生奉献给工作。也许是因为几个月前我得知了自己无法生育的消息。我询问了关于收养他的事宜，由于我作为 NERV 特工的身份和国家目前的状况，所有事情在一周内就安排妥当了。'冲击'事件后的日本正处于动荡时期，失去一座主要城市给国家留下了难以愈合的伤痕，这道伤痕至今仍在愈合中。

He never spoke about his belief in aliens, hell he never spoke at all for the first few weeks. It was a struggle just to get him to say something at the dinner table and then there was the problem of actually keeping him in the apartment. Maybe I was a bit unfair in the way we divided the tasks, maybe I was unfair in the way I teased him but if he was having problems adjusting why didn't he just speak to me? It sounds like a big deal, maybe it is and maybe it isn't, he ran away three times within the first month. He didn't go far the first two times and I was able to find him within the hour. I couldn't understand it, my friend Ritsuko described it was something called the Hedgehogs dilemma, that the closer two people are the more pain they bring each other. She said it was probably how he saw it, that the closer he got to someone the more pain he brought them and himself. He was fourteen at the time yet had been through so much, who could blame him?  
他从未谈及自己对异形的信仰，甚至在前几周里几乎一言不发。光是让他开口在餐桌上说点什么就已费尽周折，更别提让他留在公寓里了。或许在任务分配上我有些不公，或许在逗弄他时我显得不公，但如果他适应上有困难，为何不直接跟我谈谈呢？这听起来像是个大问题，或许真是，也或许不是，他在第一个月内逃跑了三次。前两次他没走远，我都在一小时内找到了他。我无法理解，我的朋友 Ritsuko 称之为“刺猬困境”，即人与人越亲近，彼此带来的痛苦就越多。她认为他大概就是这样看待的，越接近某人，带给对方和自己的痛苦就越多。那时他才十四岁，却已历经诸多磨难，谁又能怪他呢？

The third time he ran, that was the time I didn't find him. It was also the last time he ran. I was returning home from working late one night and found he wasn't there. I went out driving for about an hour. After having no luck I finally gave in and called the police, I had tried to avoid doing so the other two times but this time I had no choice. It was too risky to just wait and hope he'd return, if he wasn't found he could have died. I got the call a few hours into the morning, it didn't matter, I wasn't sleeping. Amazing isn't it? The effect this kid had on me even though I'd only known him for about a month?  
第三次他逃跑时，那次我没有找到他。也是他最后一次逃跑。那晚我加班回家，发现他不在。我开车出去找了大约一个小时。毫无收获后，我最终还是报了警，前两次我都尽量避免这么做，但这次我别无选择。只是等待并希望他回来太冒险了，如果找不到他，他可能会死的。凌晨时分，我接到了电话，无所谓，我根本没睡。不可思议吧？尽管我只认识他大约一个月，这孩子对我的影响却如此之大。

So, anyway I got the call, he' d been found in the Tokyo 3 docks district, unconscious in some abandoned bus shelter. I got to the hospital as quick as I could and went straight to his room, my eyes were red from crying and I was sure there were still tears running down my face when I got there, I didn't care though, I was going to sort this out with Shinji once and for all.  
总之，我接到了电话，他在东京 3 号码头区被发现，昏迷在一个废弃的公交候车亭里。我尽快赶到医院，直奔他的病房，我的眼睛因哭泣而红肿，我确信泪水还在脸上流淌，但我不在乎，我要和真嗣彻底解决这个问题。

**Thirteen Years Ago – Hospital Room – 0430 hours  
十三年前 —— 医院病房 —— 凌晨四点半**

I had got to the hospital at half two in the morning, at first they wouldn't let me see him. I showed them my NERV ID and they soon let me in, maybe a bit wrong on my part but I had to, I needed to see him. They led me into the room he was in and left the room, I fixed my gaze on him. He was lucky they said, if they had been a few minutes later then his condition could have been a lot worse, as it was they just had him attached to a basic monitor and were letting him sleep it off.  
我凌晨两点半赶到医院，起初他们不让我见他。我出示了 NERV 的身份证，他们很快就放我进去了，或许我这么做有点不妥，但我必须这么做，我需要见到他。他们带我进了他所在的房间，然后离开了，我凝视着他。他们说他很幸运，如果再晚几分钟，他的状况可能会糟糕得多，好在他们及时赶到，现在他只连接着基本监测仪，让他们让他睡一觉恢复。

I stood at the foot of the bed and heard a whimper from the boy, he turned violently and began thrashing slightly. I went round to his side and placed my hand on his head, hoping it would somehow calm him down. Much to my surprise it worked as he seemed to slip into a more peaceful sleep. I made sure the covers were on him fully and kissed him gently on the forehead and went over to the small table and chair in the corner, hoping to get some sleep myself.  
我站在床尾，听到男孩发出一声呜咽，他猛地转身，开始轻微地挣扎。我绕到他身边，把手放在他头上，希望这能让他平静下来。令我惊讶的是，这招奏效了，他似乎陷入了更安稳的睡眠。我确保他被被子完全盖好，轻轻地在他额头上吻了一下，然后走到角落的小桌子和椅子旁，希望自己也能睡一会儿。

I must have been asleep for two hours until I was woke up by, of all things, the sound of someone sneezing violently. I raised my head and looked around the room, hearing a slight thud as Shinji turned trying to pretend he was asleep. Did he really think I was that naïve not to know?  
我一定是睡了两个小时，直到被一阵剧烈的喷嚏声吵醒，这真是出乎意料。我抬起头，环顾房间，听到一声轻微的砰响，是真嗣转身试图假装睡着。他真的以为我那么天真，察觉不到吗？

Slowly getting up I made my way over to him, I could see he had his eyes shut tightly. I pressed my hand against his forehead and spoke softly to him.  
我慢慢起身，走向他，看到他紧闭着眼睛。我将手放在他的额头上，轻声对他说话。

"Shinji…" "真嗣…"

I could feel my voice breaking as I spoke, tears were stinging the back of my eyes but I refused to break down in front of the child. I had already cried a lot that night despite trying my best not to. I questioned him, trying my best to keep my voice steady.  
我说话时声音在颤抖，泪水刺痛了我的眼后，但我拒绝在孩子面前崩溃。尽管我尽力不哭，那一晚我已经流了很多泪。我尽量保持声音平稳，向他询问。

"Shinji, why did you run away?"  
“真嗣，你为什么要逃跑？”

I waited a short while only to have no response from him. I knew his game, he was hoping I'd simply leave him there and go home, leaving him until the morning. I wasn't going to fall for it, I moved to the bed and sat down on it, putting my arm over him.  
我等了一小会儿，却没得到他的回应。我知道他的把戏，他指望我就这么把他留在那儿，自己回家，留他到早上。我才不会上当，我走到床边坐下，手臂搭在他身上。

"Shinji, why did you do it? Is it because of me?"  
"真嗣，你为什么要这么做？是因为我吗？"

His eye's opened slightly and he answered, not daring to look at me.  
他微微睁开眼睛，回答道，不敢直视我。

"No, it's not that…" "不，不是那样的……"

"Then why?" “那又是为什么？”

"I just didn't want you to abandon me."  
"我只是不想你抛弃我。"

I raised my eyebrows slightly when he said it, he was frightened of being abandoned? That was it, how could he have been so foolish to think I'd do that? I tried to keep my temper from flaring up and instead continued to speak softly.  
他提到这个时，我微微挑了挑眉，他害怕被抛弃吗？就是这样，他怎么会这么傻，以为我会那样做？我努力压制住怒火，继续温柔地说话。

"Shinji, why would I do that?"  
"真嗣，我为什么要那么做？"

"Because everyone else has, you'll be no different, it'd have been better if you just left me."  
"因为其他人也都这样，你也不会有什么不同，如果当初你直接离开我就好了。"

He was now sitting up, tears had formed in his eyes and were slowly moving down his cheeks. I was beyond crying though, I was trying to control my temper, trying and succeeding for now.  
他现在坐了起来，泪水在眼眶中形成，缓缓滑过脸颊。但我已经哭不出来了，我正试图控制自己的脾气，努力并暂时成功了。

"I see…" "我明白了…"

"Sorry…" "对不起…"

Succeeding up until now, I shouted back at him.  
直到现在都成功了，我对他大喊回去。

"Sorry? That's all you have to say, sorry isn't going to cut it Shinji. How can you say such a thing like that?"  
"抱歉？你就只能说这个吗，光说抱歉是没用的，真嗣。你怎么能说出那样的话？"

"Because it's true, everyone abandons me."  
"因为那是事实，每个人都抛弃了我。"

I did something then I instantly regretted, he had pushed me to that point though. I felt a stinging sensation run up my hand as I slapped him. It didn't stop there, I shouted at him, unable to control myself anymore.  
我做了件立刻就后悔的事，尽管是他逼我到那个地步的。我扇了他一巴掌，手上传来一阵刺痛。但这还没完，我朝他大喊，再也控制不住自己。

"You ungrateful idiot, you think that after I take you in and go through all that to adopt you, that after I spend half the night looking for you only to find you unconscious that I'm just going to abandon you?"  
“你这个不知感恩的傻瓜，你以为我把你带回家，费尽周折领养你，半夜找你找到昏迷，就会这样抛弃你吗？”

He brought his hand up to his cheek, the tears flowing freely on his face, I could feel them running down my cheeks as well.  
他抬起手摸向脸颊，泪水在他脸上肆意流淌，我也感觉到自己的脸颊上泪流不止。

"You're not the only person in the world to have something bad happen to them Shinji."  
"世界上不止你一个人经历过不幸，真嗣。"

"I know that but… "  
"我知道，但是……"

"But nothing, if you want to leave then do it now and we won't have to see each other again. I'll take you back to the agency tomorrow and say it didn't work out. If that's what you truly want then I'm not going to stop you, Shinji. Make up your mind now because next time I'm not coming after you."  
"但别再找借口了，如果你想离开，那就现在走，我们以后也不必再见面。明天我会带你回总部，就说合作不顺利。如果你真心想走，我不会阻拦你，真嗣。现在就决定吧，因为下次我不会再来找你了。"

Nothing was said for a few moments, he was thinking on my words. I wish I could have taken them back at that moment. I didn't want him to leave, I wanted him to stay, I wanted us to become a family, no matter how fucked up we both might be. I questioned him again.  
一时间无人言语，他在思索我的话。我真希望那一刻能收回那些话。我不希望他离开，我希望他留下，我希望我们能成为一家人，无论我们俩可能有多么糟糕。我再次向他发问。

"Well what is it going to be?"  
“那么，你打算怎么办？”

Nothing was said, instead there was one simple gesture, he leaned forward, wrapping his arms around me, sobbing into my shoulder. I hugged him tightly and whispered to him.  
没有言语，取而代之的是一个简单的动作，他向前倾身，双臂环抱住我，在我肩头啜泣。我紧紧拥抱着他，轻声对他说。

"I see, lets go home Shinji."  
“我明白了，我们回家吧，真嗣。”

**Present Day 当下**

From that moment on there were no more problems, we even got to know each other a little better. I told him my reasons for joining NERV even though I felt they betrayed me with the investigation into the Impact Incident. In turn he told me how he hated his father, how he grew up with his uncle looking after him and what he could remember of his mother's death. He described it as seeing a bright light, one minute she was there the next she was gone. Maybe this was what started his belief in alien life. I thought it was nothing more then a dream but he insisted it happened.  
从那一刻起，问题不复存在，我们甚至更加了解彼此。我向他倾诉了加入 NERV 的缘由，尽管我感到他们在对冲击事件的调查中背叛了我。他则向我倾吐了对父亲的憎恨，他如何在叔叔的照料下长大，以及他对母亲去世的记忆。他形容那是一道耀眼的光芒，前一秒她还在，下一秒就消失了。或许正是这件事开启了他对异星生命的信仰。我原以为那不过是一场梦，但他坚称那是真实发生的。

When he turned eighteen he received an invitation from NERV, I was assigned to another division and he stayed in Tokyo-3. We kept in touch at first, but after a few years it was short sporadic phone calls. He'd tell me how his job was, about the cases he was working on and I would tell him the same. The more we spoke on the phone or by e-mail the more I began to notice he seemed to be slipping into his old habits again. He was losing confidence in himself, his job and the people he worked with. I was never told this explicitly but I heard stories from others about him, that he was nothing more than a walking joke after a while.  
当他满十八岁时，他收到了 NERV 的邀请，而我被分配到了另一个部门，他留在了第三新东京市。起初我们保持着联系，但几年后，通话变得零星且简短。他会告诉我他的工作情况，他在处理的案件，我也会告诉他我的。我们通过电话或电子邮件交流得越多，我就越注意到他似乎又开始重蹈覆辙。他对自己、他的工作和同事们失去了信心。虽然没有人明确告诉我，但我从别人那里听到了关于他的故事，说他后来不过是个行走的笑话。

Yet here I am now, writing this down, about to speak about the Angels he and Agent Sohryu have fought against. I could almost laugh at those who ridiculed him. Maybe Shinji was right after all, maybe they do exist and they have forms on Earth, or maybe something else is going on, maybe those old conspiracy theories about cloning are correct. I don't know what to believe anymore.  
然而现在，我坐在这里写下这些，即将谈论他和苏里尤特工对抗过的使徒。我几乎要嘲笑那些嘲笑他的人了。也许真嗣是对的，也许他们真的存在，并且在地球上有形态，或者可能还有其他事情发生，那些关于克隆的老阴谋论也许是正确的。我不再知道该相信什么了。

Kaji told me the Angels are genetically engineered humans, but genetically engineered with what? Shinji was told the Angels were part of a program to create super soldiers, but for what purpose?  
加持告诉我使徒是经过基因改造的人类，但用什么进行基因改造的呢？真嗣被告知使徒是用来制造超级士兵的计划的一部分，但目的是什么呢？

Sachiel 萨基尔

Sachiel was the first 'Angel' on record, believed to have been active for over thirty years. He was responsible for a string of child murders or abductions. It seemed that he'd hibernate for fifteen years at a time before resurfacing. He was found in the lakes on the outskirts of Tokyo 3 by Shinji, Shinji said Sachiel came out of the lake, implying this 'Angel' had some sort of ability to survive underwater. This was also the first encounter between Shinji and Rei Ayanami.  
萨基尔是有记录以来的第一个‘使徒’，据信已经活跃了超过三十年。他涉及一系列儿童谋杀或绑架案件。每隔十五年，他会进入休眠状态，然后再次出现。他在第三新东京市郊外的湖泊中被真嗣发现，真嗣说萨基尔是从湖中出现的，暗示这个‘使徒’拥有某种水下生存的能力。这也是真嗣与绫波零的首次相遇。

According to Shinji's report he saw Ayanami and fell unconscious, awaking several hours later in some sort of medical facility. At this facility both he and Agent Sohryu were injected by what they were told was an antidote to a virus in the air around where Sachiel was found.  
根据真嗣的报告，他看到了绫波后便失去了意识，几个小时后在一个类似医疗机构的地方醒来。在这个设施里，他和碇司令都被注射了他们被告知是针对在发现萨基尔地点周围空气中的病毒的解毒剂。

**Status:** Missing, presumed dead.  
状态：失踪，推定死亡。

Shamshel 夏姆榭尔

Shamshel was the second angel to be encountered, also the second sighting of Rei Ayanami. It also marked the first angel found after I took over as their director of operations. The case was assigned to them by the director, they were not given anymore information other than a name.  
沙姆谢尔是遇到的第二使徒，也是第二次目击绫波零。这也是在我接任运营总监后发现的首个使徒。案件由总监指派给他们，除了一个名字外，没有提供更多信息。

At the beginning of this case Shinji began suffering from symptoms of a yet unknown cause. Symptoms included headaches, dizziness and vomiting. At the first scene, Asuka found him unconscious in an alleyway where she also found Rei Ayanami. Ayanami then proceeded to attack Sohryu before fleeing the scene.  
此案伊始，真嗣开始出现一种未知原因的症状，包括头痛、眩晕和呕吐。在第一现场，明日香发现他昏迷在一条小巷中，同时在那里发现了绫波零。随后，绫波零攻击了惣流，之后逃离现场。

Both Sohryu and Shinji were able to track Shamshel to the same medical facility they were in during the Sachiel case. However this time the facility was abandoned with only Shamshel inside. Shinji encountered Shamshel and it is believed he killed him, however much like with Sachiel no body was found.  
惣流和真嗣追踪沙姆谢尔至萨基尔案件期间所在的同一家医疗机构。然而这次设施已被废弃，仅剩下沙姆谢尔在内。真嗣遭遇了沙姆谢尔，据信他杀死了它，但与萨基尔一样，没有发现尸体。

After Shinji was found he was taken to a hospital within Tokyo-3 where we encountered someone known as Gendo Rokubungi.  
在找到真嗣后，他被送往了第三新东京市内的一家医院，在那里我们遇到了被称为碇源堂的人。

**Status:** Missing, presumed dead.  
状态：失踪，推定死亡。

Ramiel 雷米尔

The third angel, also the first time we got to see Ayanami in action. The angel was taken out with a precision shot from a high powered sniper rifle lent to us by the weapons research department of the Japanese Government. Ramiel had the uncanny ability to aim and fire with the utmost accuracy. Being able to take out bullets in mid-flight and fire back immediately. It was thanks to the bravery of Rei Ayanami nearly sacrificing herself that this angel was defeated.  
第三使徒，也是我们首次目睹绫波丽的战斗风采。这名使徒被日本政府武器研究部门借给我们的一把高威力狙击步枪精准击毙。拉米尔拥有不可思议的瞄准与射击能力，能中途拦截子弹并立即反击。正是由于绫波丽近乎牺牲自我的英勇行为，才得以击败这名使徒。

**Status:** Dead, shot by Agent Shinji Ikari  
状态：已故，被碇真嗣特工射杀

Gaghiel 加吉尔

Not much is known about this Angel, Asuka encountered it on the military ship 'Over The Rainbow' where it was masquerading as the Admiral. A fight broke out between Asuka and the Angel in a laboratory on the ship, me and Shinji arrived at the end to find Asuka had already defeated it.  
关于这位使徒的信息并不多，明日香在军舰‘彩虹之上’遇到了它，当时它伪装成了舰队司令。明日香与使徒在舰上的实验室爆发了战斗，我和真嗣赶到时，明日香已经击败了它。

Agent Kaji put in a report that prior to the discovery of Gaghiel Asuka seemed to be suffering from dizziness and headaches. The same symptoms Shinji had before Shamshel, is it possible the two situations are connected?  
加持先生提交的报告中提到，在发现加吉尔之前，明日香似乎出现了头晕和头痛的症状。这与真嗣在沙姆谢尔事件前的症状相同，这两者之间是否存在关联？

**Status:** Dead, shot by Agent Asuka Sohryu  
状态：已故，被代理者惣流·明日香·兰格雷射杀

Israfel 伊斯瑞尔

Also known as 'The Twins', this angel is probably one of the strangest we've encountered. About ten years ago twin girls were abducted from their home, several years later they returned but had not aged a single day. Shinji learnt of this Angel from Agent Kaji and set out to find it. At the time it was not revealed they were an angel.  
亦被称为‘双生子’，这位天使可能是我们所遇见过最奇特的存在之一。大约十年前，一对双胞胎女孩从家中被绑架，几年后她们回来了，却丝毫未见岁月的痕迹。真嗣从加持先生那里得知了这位天使的存在，并踏上了寻找它的旅程。当时并未揭露她们是天使的身份。

He and Agent Sohryu arrived at the home of the Twins and their parents only to find that their house had been burnt down. They were attacked by an unknown man at the scene who promptly ran into the forest. In the forest they found another dead body, cause of death appeared to be Sudden Adult Death Syndrome, the man did however appear to have some sort of religious symbol on his body.  
他和惣流特工抵达双生子的家时，却发现他们的房子已被烧毁。在现场，他们遭到一个身份不明的男子袭击，该男子随即逃入森林。在森林中，他们发现另一具尸体，死因似乎是突发性成人死亡综合症，但此人身上似乎有某种宗教符号。

Shortly after discovering this they were led to Agent Ayanami's apartment to find the twins occupying it. When they encountered them they appeared to be of a young age, they had the ability however to shape shift to an older appearance and then into one being. When they were separate they were able to think and act of one mind, thanks to Agent Sohryu's fast thinking they were defeated.  
不久后，他们被带到特工绫波零的公寓，发现双胞胎已占据此处。当他们遇到这对双胞胎时，他们看似年幼，却拥有变形成年外貌并合二为一的能力。当他们分开时，能以同一心智思考和行动，多亏了特工惣流迅速的应变，他们最终被击败。

**Status: Dead, killed by Agent's Shinji Ikari & Asuka Sohryu.  
状态：已故，被特工碇真嗣与惣流·明日香·兰格雷所杀。**

Sandalphon 桑达尔丰

The subway killer, Sandalphon, was found hidden in a secret tank room deep in the Tokyo-3 subway system. This was the first Angel where the question of genetic alteration came up. It burst out of a tank attacking Sohryu and was seemingly incomplete. After being incapacitated it was brought back to NERV for an autopsy, which was performed by Dr Ritsuko Akagi. She found that the being was human but was covered in some sort of impregnable shell.  
地铁杀手，桑达尔丰，被发现在东京-3 地铁系统深处的一个秘密储罐室内。这是第一个引发基因改造问题的使徒。它从一个储罐中冲出，攻击了惣流，看似尚未完成。在被制服后，它被带回 NERV 进行尸检，由赤城律子博士执行。她发现这个生物虽为人形，却被某种坚不可摧的外壳所覆盖。

Luckily for us the shell had not yet developed and was still in a state of growth. My question is if they had got there later what would that mean for the rest of us?  
幸运的是，这个外壳尚未发育完全，仍处于生长阶段。我的疑问是，如果他们晚些到达，这对我们其他人意味着什么？

**Status: Dead, killed by Agent's Shinji Ikari & Asuka Sohryu.  
状态：已故，被碇真嗣和惣流·明日香·兰格雷特工所杀。**

Mattariel 马塔里埃尔

The most recent Angel and probably the most bizarre yet encountered. This angel was like something out of a horror movie, a cross almost between a human and a spider. Several smaller spiders lived within the beast and also bred within the beasts victims. On the night the Angel was defeated Tokyo 3 also suffered from a complete city wide power outage, whether or not it was related to the Angel I don't know.  
最近出现的使徒，也是迄今为止最奇特的一个。这个使徒宛如恐怖电影中的怪物，近乎人蛛混合体。其体内寄居着数只小蜘蛛，并在受害者体内繁殖。使徒被击败的那晚，第三东京市遭遇了全城范围的停电，是否与此使徒有关，我不得而知。

The angel was eventually found in a warehouse on the outskirts by all three Agents. Agent Sohryu eventually took it out but not before it injured her and also rendered both Shinji and Rei unconscious. Shortly afterwards both Rei and Shinji were given a shot by Ritsuko, she claimed it was an antidote to the spiders toxin. Asuka however did not receive this having fled the scene after an incident with Shinji.  
最终，三位特工在郊外的一个仓库中发现了这个使徒。惣流·明日香·兰格雷特工最终将其消灭，但在此之前，她自己受了伤，同时使真嗣和绫波零陷入了昏迷。随后，律子给真嗣和绫波注射了一针，她声称这是蜘蛛毒素的解毒剂。然而，明日香并未接受注射，因为在与真嗣发生冲突后，她逃离了现场。

**Status: Dead, killed by Agent Asuka Sohryu.  
状态：已故，被碇明日香特工所杀。**

As I finish writing the section on the last Angel I think about how each one has played out so far. How near to death Shinji, Asuka or Rei have came each time. How they are part of something called Project Evangelion, my only question is without these so called Evangelions what does it mean for the rest of us?  
当我写完关于最后一个使徒的部分时，我想到了迄今为止每一个使徒的结局。每一次，真嗣、明日香或绫波都濒临死亡。他们参与了一个名为“福音计划”的项目，我唯一的问题是，如果没有这些所谓的福音机，对我们其他人来说这意味着什么？

**Meeting Room 会议室**

Intimidation, it is a key factor in their line of work. To get what they wanted they needed to be able to intimidate the other person. Gendo Ikari knew this all too well and many would consider him to be a master in that dark art. He sat at the foot of the table looking directly ahead, his hands folded neatly in front of his face, slightly obscuring his mouth. His face portrayed no emotion, of course attempting to intimidate the committee was a futile process, and he knew that all too well.  
威慑，是他们这一行的关键因素。为了得到他们想要的东西，他们需要能够震慑对方。碇源堂对此了如指掌，许多人甚至认为他是这门黑暗艺术的宗师。他坐在桌尾，直视前方，双手整齐地叠放在脸前，微微遮住了嘴。他的脸上没有流露任何情感，当然，试图震慑委员会是徒劳的，他对此心知肚明。

The man at the other end of the table, Chairman Keel, began to speak. "Seven of the thirteen angels have been defeated, you surprise us Ikari. We did not expect your chosen subjects to be so efficient."  
桌子另一端的主席基尔开始发言。“十三位使徒中已有七位被击败，碇源堂，你让我们感到意外。我们没想到你选中的实验对象会如此高效。”

Gendo smiled slightly from behind his hands and replied, "Of course, the Evangelion serum developed years ago by Dr Sohryu and my wife at GEHIRN was developed to combat the angels, regardless of who the subject was."  
碇源堂在手后微微一笑，回答道：“当然，由葛城博士和我在 GEHIRN 时期开发的 EVA 血清，旨在对抗使徒，无论实验对象是谁。”

One of the other men in the room spoke with an American accent, "Nonetheless we must not become complacent, there are still several angels remaining. The first seven were minor experiments, the rest were created to the full extent of our resources."  
房间里的另一个人带着美国口音说道，“尽管如此，我们绝不能掉以轻心，还有几名天使尚未解决。前七个只是小规模的实验，其余的都是我们资源全力打造的。”

"I am aware of this, this is why we have given both Unit 0 and 1 a higher dosage of the serum."  
“我明白这一点，这就是为什么我们给零号和一号单位加大了血清剂量。”

One of the other men spoke out in surprise, "What of Unit 2?"  
另一个人惊讶地插话道，“那二号单位呢？”

"She had left the scene before the dosage could be administered. It is unimportant however, she is an expendable factor."  
"她在剂量施用前就离开了现场。不过这无关紧要，她是个可牺牲的因素。"

"Yet it was her mother that was responsible for the serum."  
"然而，研制血清的正是她的母亲。"

"I am aware of this."  
"这一点我清楚。"

Keel interrupted the brief exchange, "Enough of this gentleman, we have more important matters to discuss. This is that of the human instrumentality project, we now have the full go ahead to complete the project. We have made contact with the others and they will be sending nine of their people to us by the end of the year."  
基尔打断了短暂的交流，“够了，绅士们，我们有更重要的事情要讨论。这是关于人类补完计划的事宜，我们现在已全面获准完成该项目。我们已经与其他人取得了联系，他们将在年底前向我们派遣九名人员。”

"Understood." “明白了。”

"Good, that is all. We will be contacting you again in the future when we are closer to our goal."  
“很好，就这样。当我们更接近目标时，我们会再次联系你们。”

**Asuka's Residence 明日香的家**

Asuka lay on her bed looking straight up at the ceiling, her bandaged arm resting against her forehead. She sat up and slowly got out of bed, feeling slight pain with each minor movement. She stood and moved towards the mirror looking at her naked body, observing the several scars covering most of her mid section and arms.  
明日香躺在床上，直直地盯着天花板，她那包扎着的手臂搁在额头上。她坐起身，缓缓下床，每动一下都能感到轻微的疼痛。她站起身，走向镜子，审视着自己赤裸的身体，观察着遍布腹部和手臂的数道伤疤。

Downstairs she heard the front door closing, moving over towards the window she saw Rei walking down the path going to NERV. Asuka sighed and sat back down on the bed. It had been three weeks since Mattariel, three weeks since she had kissed him and three weeks since she had ran away from him. Every day of those three weeks she had asked herself why she had done it and she could never think of an answer.  
楼下她听到前门关闭的声音，走近窗户，她看到丽正沿着小路走向 NERV。明日香叹了口气，又坐回床上。距离马特里埃尔已经过去三周了，三周前她吻了他，也是三周前她逃离了他。这三周的每一天，她都在问自己为什么要这么做，却始终想不出答案。

She couldn't even think why she had kissed him. Prior to that she hadn't thought of him as anything but a work colleague and, if she was being honest, a bit of an idiot. Although she had to admit to herself that after all that had happened maybe his ideas and beliefs weren't so strange after all. That was still no reason to do what she did though and then she had ran away. Was it fear?  
她甚至想不通自己为什么要吻他。在那之前，她只把他当作一个工作伙伴，如果诚实地说，还有点傻。尽管她不得不承认，经历了这一切之后，他的想法和信仰或许并不那么奇怪。但这仍然不是她那样做的理由，然后她还逃跑了。是出于恐惧吗？

'_Fear of him? Why would I be scared, no he…it wasn't…damnit I'm going to look like a fool now and it's all stupid Shinji's fault._  
'怕他？我为什么要害怕，不，他……不是……该死，我现在看起来像个傻瓜，都是那个笨蛋真嗣的错。

Asuka looked across the room towards her bedside table. On it lay her NERV ID, she picked it up and looked at the picture of her on the front, remembering how she came to join NERV and all that had happened since she had been assigned to Tokyo 3. It had been a perfect opportunity for her, she even had the attention of the director now, she wasn't going to let it go to waste.  
明日香环视房间，目光落在了床头柜上。那里放着她的 NERV ID 卡，她拿起它，看着正面自己的照片，回忆起加入 NERV 的缘由以及被分配到第三新东京市后发生的种种。这对她来说是个绝佳的机会，甚至现在还引起了指挥官的注意，她绝不会让这一切白白浪费。

'_I'm going back, after all if I don't they'll be lost without me.'_  
'我要回去，毕竟如果我不回去，他们会因为失去我而不知所措的。'

After a short while she had changed into her suit and was standing in front of the mirror admiring herself, a smile on her face. She brought her bandaged hand up to her face and looked at it slightly before beginning to unravel the bandages, flinching as with each movement pain shot up her arm.  
片刻之后，她换上了自己的泳衣，站在镜子前自我欣赏，脸上挂着微笑。她将包扎着的手举到脸前，略微打量后开始解开绷带，每动一下，手臂上的疼痛便如电击般袭来。

She got downstairs, in the living room the makeshift bed she had gave Ayanami was made. Rei however had seemed to leave her jacket behind, Asuka picked it up and something caught her eye in the inside pocket. She took it out and realized it was a photograph, turning it over and looked at it and immediately dropped it to the floor looking at it in shock.  
她下楼来到客厅，那里有她为绫波准备的临时床铺。然而，丽似乎留下了她的夹克，明日香捡起夹克，内袋里有什么东西吸引了她的注意。她掏出来一看，原来是一张照片，翻过来看时，她立刻惊得将照片掉落在地，满脸震惊地盯着它。

"That's her and Shinji's father, just who the hell is Rei Ayanami?"  
“那是她和真嗣的父亲，绫波丽到底是谁？”

**A/N:** One of my shortest chapters I know, it was intended to be, my main intention was to focus a bit more on Shinji & Misato's relationship and how they came to meet. Second intention was to set up for Leliel. I'll be going back to normal length chapters with Leliel, just think of this as a short bridge. That said though this was probably one of my favorite chapters to write.  
作者注：我知道这是我的章节中最短的一篇，确实是故意为之。我的主要目的是更深入地探讨真嗣和美里之间的关系以及他们相遇的过程。第二个目的是为雷里尔的情节做铺垫。接下来我会回到正常长度的章节，可以把这一章看作是一个短暂的过渡。尽管如此，这可能是我最喜欢写的一章。

### Chapter 16 Apprehension  

_7th July 2015 2015 年 7 月 7 日_

**NERV Offices – 0915 hours  
NERV 总部 – 上午 0915 时**

Shinji stopped just as his hand reached the door handle and sighed, he wanted to just turn around and go back home. Not a day had passed since Metareal that he hadn't thought of what had happened, it was always there in the front of his mind, playing over and over again and no matter how hard he tried he just couldn't get it away.  
真嗣的手刚要触到门把手时停了下来，叹了口气。他真想转身回家。自从 Metareal 事件以来，没有一天他不曾想起所发生的事，它总是萦绕在他的脑海中，一遍又一遍地重现，无论他多么努力，都无法摆脱。

He subconsciously brought his hand up to his face where Asuka had slapped him. It had been nearly a month now since it had happened yet he could still feel the sting. He had been told by Misato that he wasn't to blame for it, that it wasn't his fault, but still he wondered, '_Why did she blame me?'_  
他下意识地抬起手，摸向被明日香扇过耳光的脸颊。事情已经过去近一个月了，但他仍能感受到那股刺痛。美里告诉他，这不是他的错，他无需自责，然而他仍在思索，'为什么她要怪我？'

He opened the door and stepped into the office where he was surprised to see Asuka was already sitting at her desk writing something. Shinji uttered a subdued greeting and moved to his desk. That's how it had been since she had returned to work. They would greet each other then sit down and do nothing but NERV Paperwork. There were no cases to work on, no words other than the essentials exchanged. Every so often Asuka would leave the office and return a few hours later carrying various assorted files. Shinji never asked what they were or where she went, he just came in did whatever he needed to do and went home.  
他推开门，走进办公室，惊讶地发现明日香已经坐在桌前写着什么。真嗣低声打了个招呼，走向自己的座位。自从她复工以来，情况便是如此。他们互相问候，然后各自坐下处理 NERV 的文书工作。没有案件需要处理，除了必要的话，彼此间再无交流。偶尔，明日香会离开办公室，几小时后带着各种文件回来。真嗣从不问这些文件是什么，她去了哪里，他只是来这里完成该做的事，然后回家。

Today however started off a little bit differently, this time as soon as Shinji sat down he noticed Asuka looking at him. Holding a document up as she spoke.  
然而今天，情况稍有不同，真嗣刚一坐下，就注意到明日香正看着他。她举着一份文件，开口说道。

"This just came in, thought we should look at it."  
“这份文件刚到，我觉得我们应该看一下。”

Asuka waited for Shinji to get up and take the document, again there were no words exchanged instead, just an uncomfortable silence as Shinji read through the document and Asuka waited for him to hand it back. She wished she could somehow erase what had happened, maybe then she wouldn't feel like an idiot every time he or Katsuragi was nearby. Maybe she'd be able to rid herself of that awful feeling of guilt.  
明日香等着真嗣起身接过文件，两人依旧没有言语交流，只有一阵尴尬的沉默。真嗣阅读文件时，明日香等待着他归还。她多么希望能抹去发生的一切，或许那样她就不会每次在他或葛城美里附近时感觉自己像个傻瓜。也许她就能摆脱那糟糕的负罪感。

Moments later he handed the document back to her questioning her, his voice unenthusiastic.  
片刻后，他将文件递还给她，语气平淡地询问。

"Have we been assigned this case?"  
"我们被指派了这个案子吗？"

Surprised for a moment, she took a few moments to answer back. Shinji never usually questioned a case.  
她一时惊讶，过了片刻才回答。真嗣通常不会对案件提出疑问。

"No not yet but I thou…"  
"还没有，但我想……"

He cut her off, "Then we should just leave it."  
他打断她，“那我们就别管它了。”

She frowned as he sat back down at his desk, that feeling of guilt creeping back into her consciousness. Mentally she shouted at herself for feeling guilty.  
他重新坐回桌前，她皱起眉头，那种愧疚感又悄悄爬回她的意识中。她在心里对自己大喊，不该感到内疚。

'_No, it's not my fault the idiot is being like this, it's something else. It was three weeks ago, he won't be angry at me.'_  
“不，这不是我的错，那傻瓜这样子，肯定有别的原因。那是三周前的事了，他不会生我气的。”

Smiling, she replied, "Since when has that stopped you before?"  
她微笑着回答：“什么时候这事儿能阻止过你？”

"What do you mean?" "你这是什么意思？"

"You know fine well what I mean, since when has us not being assigned the case stopped you before. Half of the cases we've been on down here haven't been assigned to us, why is this one different?"  
“你很清楚我的意思，我们没被指派这个案子，以前也没阻止过你。我们接手的案子有一半都不是指派给我们的，为什么这次不同？”

"It's just…I don't think we should get involved with anything that we haven't been told to go on anymore."  
“只是……我觉得我们不应该再插手那些没被指示去办的事了。”

Asuka was trying very hard not to get angry with him, she sighed and turned to her computer screen and then back to him. For a brief moment their eyes met and Asuka immediately glanced down at her desk.  
明日香正努力不让自己对他发火，她叹了口气，转向电脑屏幕，然后又回头看他。有那么一瞬间，他们的目光相遇，明日香立刻低头看向自己的桌子。

'_Why is he being so stubborn, this can't be because of what happened and if it is then why can't he just ask about it instead of being like this?'_  
'他为什么这么固执，这不可能是由于那件事，如果是的话，他为什么不直接问清楚，而非要这样呢？'

"I don't see why, wasn't that the whole point of our section? To work on the cases no one else wanted to."  
“我不明白为什么，这不是我们部门存在的意义吗？处理那些别人不愿意接手的案件。”

"I know but..." "我知道但是..."

She quickly cut him off before he could argue back, she wasn't going to tell him why she wanted to work on this, instead she tried for a different approach.  
她迅速打断了他，不让他有机会反驳，她并不打算告诉他为什么想做这件事，而是尝试换个方式。

"Look, if it makes you feel any better I can get clearance from Katsuragi just because you seem to have this sudden affinity for the rules or we can stop wasting our time and take a look at this now."  
“听着，如果这能让你感觉好些，我可以找葛城美里拿到许可，就因为你突然对规则这么执着，或者我们可以别再浪费时间，现在就来看看这个。”

Shinji thought for a moment, being honest he hadn't even looked at the file Asuka had handed to him, he was too busy trying to think of something to say to her. He gave in and stood up.  
真嗣想了一会儿，老实说他连明日香递给他的文件都没看，他一直在忙着想怎么跟她说话。他妥协了，站起身来。

"You're right, sorry." "你说得对，抱歉。"

"Of course I'm right. I wouldn't be me if I wasn't right."  
"我当然是对的。如果我错了，那我就不是我了。"

"Well you were wrong about what you thought that last Angel was going to be."  
"好吧，关于你认为最后一个天使会是什么，你可就错了。"

As soon as the words left his mouth Shinji pictured himself holding a shovel and standing in a very large hole, an obsidian black grave marker above it, etched with the letters IKARI SHINJI 1987-2015….His idea of a joke comment only caused them both to return to that uncomfortable silence. After a short moment Asuka spoke quietly, smiling slightly.  
话音刚落，真嗣就想象自己拿着一把铲子站在一个巨大的坑边，坑上立着一块黑曜石般的墓碑，上面刻着‘碇真嗣 1987-2015’……他本以为这是个玩笑，却只让他们再次陷入尴尬的沉默。片刻后，明日香轻声开口，嘴角微微上扬。

"Ok, I was wrong on that one but even people like me have to be wrong at least once, right?"  
“好吧，这次我错了，但像我这样的人至少也得错一次，对吧？”

He laughed as he replied, "Yeah, so what are the details of this?"  
他笑着回答：“是啊，那这事的细节是什么？”

"You just read the file and forgot already?"  
"你刚读完文件就忘了？"

"Sorry." "对不起。"

"Never mind, a few days ago a man was the victim of an attack, he suffered no physical injuries and has no memory of what happened."  
"没关系，前几天有个男人遭遇了袭击，他没有受到身体伤害，也不记得发生了什么。"

"Could he have been drunk and passed out?"  
"他会不会是喝醉了然后昏过去了？"

"That's what the doctors and people involved so far thought but there was no alcohol in his system or anything else that could have caused it. Everyone involved has no idea as to what happened."  
"这就是目前医生和相关人员所认为的，但他的体内没有酒精或任何其他可能导致这种情况的物质。所有相关人员都不知道发生了什么。"

Mentally she finished her sentence, _'And then of course there was the LCL he was found near.'_  
她在心里完成了这句话，'当然，还有他被发现时附近的那滩 LCL。'

"So that's where we come in?"  
"所以这就是我们介入的地方？"

'_We already have, that's where I've been the past few days'_  
'我们已经去过了，这就是我过去几天的去向'

She didn't say what she was thinking instead just nodded, "Yes."  
她没有说出自己的想法，只是点了点头，"是的。"

"You think it could be another angel?"  
“你觉得可能是另一个天使吗？”

The voice inside her head replied yet again. _'It is.'_  
她脑海中的声音再次回应道：“是的。”

"I don't know yet." “我还不知道。”

**Hospital – 1000 hours 医院 – 上午十点**

They both stepped onto the ward, Shinji looked up at the signs, noticing where they were. The psychiatric ward. Shinji began to wonder if there was more to this than what Asuka had told him. He was about to question it when a nurse came out of one of the rooms and stopped them both.  
两人一同踏入病房区，真嗣抬头看向指示牌，注意到他们所在的位置。精神科病房。真嗣开始怀疑，这背后是否还有更多阿斯卡没有告诉他的事情。他正要开口询问，这时一名护士从一间病房里走出来，拦住了他们。

"Agent Sohryu, you're back, and who's this with you?"  
“索鲁尤·苏鲁，你回来了，这位是谁？”

Asuka cursed silently as the nurse asked her question, she quickly caught a glimpse of Shinji, he was looking at her she tried to avoid his gaze.  
护士的问题让明日香暗自咒骂，她迅速瞥了一眼真嗣，他正看着她，而她试图避开他的目光。

"This is the guy I work with, Agent Ikari."  
"这是我同事，碇一诚特工。"

The nurse turned to look at Shinji. "Oh so you're with NERV as well?"  
护士转向看着真嗣。“哦，你也是 NERV 的成员吗？”

He nodded but was cut off by Asuka. "We're here to visit Mr. Ushiyama."  
他点头，但被明日香打断了。“我们是来看望鹫山先生的。”

"Of course, he's in the same room as before, I'm sorry to tell you his condition hasn't improved. If anything he's gotten worse. Poor thing, he can't even recognize his own family now."  
"当然，他还在之前的房间里，很遗憾地告诉你，他的状况并没有好转。甚至可以说更糟了。可怜的孩子，他现在连自己的家人都认不出来了。"

"I see, well we'll go have a look, thank you."  
"我明白了，我们会去看看的，谢谢你。"

The nurse nodded and continued down the hall way, Shinji stood still looking at Asuka, not sure of what to think. She had already been here and hadn't told him, he was about to ask her what she knew when she beat him to it.  
护士点点头，继续沿着走廊走去，真嗣站在原地看着明日香，不知道该作何感想。她已经来过这里，却没有告诉他，他正要问她知道些什么时，她抢先开了口。

"Look before you even say anything, there's a reason I didn't tell you. I wanted to make sure of something."  
"在你开口之前先听我说，我不告诉你是有原因的。我想先确认一些事情。"

Shinji wanted to say something back but couldn't bring himself to say anything. Instead he just let it slip by and nodded.  
真嗣想说些什么，却无法开口。他只是任由这沉默流逝，然后点了点头。

"It's fine." "没关系。"

"Good, then let's go." “好，那我们走吧。”

As they walked towards the room Shinji stayed silent, his mind trying to find a reason for Asuka not telling him about this. For some reason the fact hurt him, yet at the same time he felt that maybe he was to blame. After all he had gone behind Asuka and Misato's back in the past because of something he was chasing up.  
当他们走向房间时，真嗣保持沉默，心里试图找出让明日香没有告诉他这件事的原因。不知为何，这个事实让他感到受伤，但同时他又觉得可能是自己的错。毕竟，他曾因为追逐某件事而背着明日香和美里做过一些事。

They came to a stop outside one of the doors and made their way inside, the room itself being a standard hospital room. There was a TV set up on a table in the corner, around it were various get well cards from what Shinji assumed was the persons family. Shinji turned around and took a look at the person they were there to see. He was a man in his mid thirties, he was sitting up in bed staring directly at the TV, not blinking, not moving and not paying any attention to the two agents that had entered the room. There was a far away look in his eyes.  
他们在其中一扇门外停下，然后走了进去，房间本身是一个标准的医院病房。角落里有一台电视机，周围摆满了来自真嗣猜测是病人家人的各种康复卡片。真嗣转过身，看向他们来探望的那个人。他是一个三十多岁的男人，坐在床上，直盯着电视，没有眨眼，没有动弹，也没有注意到进入房间的两位探员。他的眼神中带着一种遥远的神情。

'_Like black holes in the sky.'_ Shinji thought to himself.  
‘宛如天际的黑洞。’真嗣暗自思忖。

There was something else there, Shinji noticed it in his right hand but couldn't see it properly, and Asuka seemed to be transfixed by it as well. Shinji then noticed she had turned slightly pale since they had entered the room.  
那里还有别的东西，真嗣注意到它在他右手边，但看不真切，而明日香似乎也被它深深吸引。真嗣还注意到，自从他们进入房间后，她的脸色变得有些苍白。

"Are you feeling alright?"  
“你还好吗？”

"I'm fine." She began to move towards the man, her heart began to beat more rapidly. She took a deep breath and spoke quietly to the man. "Mr Ushiyama it's Agent Sohryu again. I brought Agent Ikari with me. He's the one I told you about the other day, the one I work with."  
"我没事。" 她开始向那名男子走去，心跳加速。她深吸一口气，轻声对男子说："Ushiyama 先生，我是 Sohryu 特工，再次来访。我带了 Ikari 特工一起来，他就是我前几天提到的，和我一起工作的那个。"

Ushiyama turned his head to look at Shinji, as he did so Shinji felt a chill run down his spine. The look in the mans eyes was not normal, it was as if he was looking at Shinji yet at the same time staring right through him, as if he was staring right into Shinji's soul. Shinji stepped forward slightly as Asuka continued talking to the man.  
Ushiyama 转头看向真嗣，就在这时，真嗣感到一股寒意沿着脊椎而下。那人的眼神不寻常，仿佛在看着真嗣，同时又直直地穿透了他，就像是在直视真嗣的灵魂。真嗣微微向前一步，而明日香继续与那人交谈。

"We'd just like to ask a few questions, if that's alright with you?"  
"我们只是想问几个问题，如果可以的话？"

Ushiyama nodded and spoke his voice quiet and distant.  
牛山点了点头，声音低沉而遥远。

"Go ahead." "说吧。"

Shinji stepped forward, not really to sure of what to ask the man or what Asuka had already asked him.  
真嗣走上前，不太确定该问些什么，也不知道明日香已经问过他什么了。

"Mr Ushiyama, can you remember anything about the attack?"  
“牛山先生，您能记起关于那次袭击的任何事情吗？”

Ushiyama turned to Shinji and smiled.  
牛山转向真嗣，微笑着。

"Attack? You're mistaken Shinji. It was no attack, it was an awakening."  
“攻击？你误会了，真嗣。那不是攻击，是觉醒。”

"A...An awakening?" The agent stuttered.  
“觉...觉醒？”特工结巴道。

"Yes, I saw it, for the first time I saw reality, and then I was pulled away from it."  
"是的，我看到了，这是我第一次看到现实，然后我就被拉离了它。"

Asuka looked on, this being the first time she had heard the man speak more then a few words. Her attention turned once again to the thing in his hand, she noticed it was a small sheet of paper with something scribbled on it.  
明日香注视着，这是她第一次听到这个男人说超过几个字。她的注意力再次转向他手中的东西，她注意到那是一张小纸片，上面潦草地写着什么。

"What do you mean, the first time you saw reality?"  
"你说的第一次看到现实是什么意思？"

"This isn't real, it's an illusion created by them, they only want you to think it's real but it's not. I've seen the real world and it's not like this."  
“这不是真的，这是他们制造的幻觉，他们只想让你以为这是真的，但其实不是。我见过真实的世界，它不是这样的。”

Shinji frowned, Ushiyama's words not making any sense to him. He tried to get more information from him. "Who wants us to think this is real?"  
真嗣皱眉，牛山的话对他来说毫无意义。他试图从他那里获取更多信息。“谁想让我们认为这是真的？”

Ushiyama spoke again, not answering Shinji's question but sounding more frantic with each word. "Leliel doesn't want us to see the true reality. Leliel is the master of illusion. Leliel controls us all."  
牛山再次开口，没有回答真嗣的问题，但每个字都显得更加慌乱。“莉莉尔不想让我们看到真正的现实。莉莉尔是幻觉的主宰。莉莉尔控制着我们所有人。”

"What is the true reality?"  
“何为真正的现实？”

Ushiyama nodded towards Asuka, "This is her reality."  
Ushiyama 向 Asuka 点头示意，“这是她的现实。”

The room fell into silence as both Asuka and Shinji looked at each other, Asuka with a look of confusion on her face, Shinji looking just as bewildered, if not more. Slowly Ushiyama began to place the paper into Shinji's hand, Shinji however did not unfold it but instead handed it to Asuka. She unfolded it and stood transfixed on the image, she felt a sick feeling rush to her stomach and to the back of her mouth.  
房间陷入沉默，Asuka 和 Shinji 互相对视，Asuka 脸上满是困惑，而 Shinji 同样迷茫，甚至更甚。Ushiyama 缓缓将纸张放入 Shinji 手中，但 Shinji 并未展开，而是转手递给了 Asuka。她展开纸张，凝视着上面的图像，感到一阵恶心涌上心头，直达喉咙。

"What…what is this?" "这…这是什么？"

She dropped the paper and ran out of the room, her hand clamped over her mouth as she struggled not to be sick. Shinji stood up to go after her, only for her to go into the female toilets on the ward. He returned to Ushiyama's room and noticed the man had fallen asleep, slowly he picked up the sheet of paper and looked at the image on it. The image appeared to be that of a doll handing from the ceiling of a hospital room similar to the one Shinji was standing in now.  
她丢下那张纸，捂着嘴冲出了房间，努力不让自己吐出来。真嗣站起身想去追她，却见她跑进了病房的女生厕所。他回到 Ushiyama 的房间，注意到那人已经睡着了。他慢慢地捡起那张纸，看着上面的图像。图像显示一个玩偶悬挂在类似他现在所处病房的医院天花板上。

Shinji stepped out into the corridor to wait for Asuka to return, he was about to step out of the ward when his phone began to ring. Taking a look at the number, it was one he didn't recognise.  
真嗣走到走廊上等待明日香回来，正要走出病房时，他的手机开始响了。看了一下来电号码，是个他不认识的号码。

"Hello?" “喂？”

The voice came over the headset, it was that of an old man. Shinji recognised it immediately.  
耳机中传来一个老者的声音，真嗣立刻就认出了那是谁。

"_Agent Ikari, do you remember me?"_  
“碇探员，你还记得我吗？”

He spoke quietly into the phone. "Spender."  
他对着电话轻声说道：“斯宾德。”

"_That's correct, are you alone?"_  
"没错，你一个人吗？"

Shinji looked along the corridor and into the room, Asuka hadn't returned yet and Ushiyama was still asleep. He was the only one in the area, he confirmed this with Spender.  
真嗣沿着走廊望向房间，明日香还没回来，而牛山还在熟睡。他确认了这一带只有自己一人，并向斯宾德确认了这一点。

"Yes I am." "是的，我一个人。"

"_Good, now listen carefully. The person you are after, Leliel, is an angel. A very dangerous one as you might already know after seeing the condition of his victim. I can help you, I know his location."_  
"很好，现在仔细听。你追查的那个人，Leliel，是个天使。一个非常危险的天使，你可能已经从他的受害者状况中知道了。我可以帮你，我知道他的位置。"

Shinji paused for a moment, thinking about what he had just been told, Spender knew about the case and the victim. "What do I need to do?"  
真嗣停顿了一下，思考着刚刚被告知的事情，斯宾塞知道这个案件和受害者。“我需要做什么？”

"_Nothing, just give me your word you will show no restraint when dealing with Leliel."_  
"什么都不用做，只要给我你的承诺，对付 Leliel 时绝不手软。"

"N-No restraint?" "没-没有限制吗？"

"_That's right, my organization has classified Leliel as extremely dangerous, you must make sure he is killed or you risk hundreds more victims like the one you have just visited."_  
"没错，我的组织已将 Leliel 列为极度危险，你必须确保他死亡，否则会有数百名像你刚探访过的那样的受害者。"

"I…I understand." "我…我明白了。"

"_Good, I will contact you later tonight with the details you require to find him. Make sure both you and Agent Sohryu are well prepared, you can not afford to take any risks with this Angel."_  
"很好，我今晚稍后会联系你，告诉你找到他的详细信息。确保你和草薙特工都做好充分准备，面对这位使徒，你们不能有任何闪失。"

"Hold on a minute, me and Agent Sohryu?"  
"等一下，我和草薙特工？"

"_Yes, she already knows part of the Angel's power, she was the one who found the LCL."_  
"是的，她已经了解使徒的部分力量，正是她发现了 LCL。"

"You mean she already knew it was an Angel?"  
"你是说她早就知道那是天使？"

"_Yes, did she not tell you?"_  
"是的，她没告诉你吗？"

"No, she never said a thing."  
"没有，她什么都没说。"

"_I see, that's too bad then."_  
"我明白了，那真是遗憾。"

With those words the phone line went dead. Shinji stood still with the phone in his hand, staring at the screen. He then looked up slowly to where Asuka had gone into and frowned. She knew about it and never told him, she had known all along that it was an Angel and had not bothered to say a word. An idea began to form in his mind, he looked towards the end of the corridor and smiled slightly.  
随着这些话，电话线断了。真嗣手里拿着电话，呆呆地盯着屏幕。然后他慢慢地抬头看向明日香进去的地方，皱起了眉头。她知道这件事，却从未告诉他，她早就知道那是使徒，却一句话也没说。一个念头开始在他脑海中形成，他朝走廊尽头望去，微微一笑。

**Laboratory – 1615 hours 实验室 – 16 点 15 分**

"What's her status?" "她的状态如何？"

Ritsuko looked out from behind the computer and into the tank, her glasses reflecting the dim orange emanating from the tank. She began to read off the results from her screen.  
律子从电脑后探出身子，望向水槽，她的眼镜反射出水槽发出的昏暗橙光。她开始从屏幕上读取结果。

"Vital signs are showing normal, body is showing no signs of rejecting the increased concentration in the serum. Core is also stable, no problems to report."  
"生命体征显示正常，身体未出现排斥血清浓度增加的迹象。核心也稳定，没有问题报告。"

"Good and what about the dummy plug system."  
"好，那备用插件系统呢？"

"The dummy plug system is not yet ready, we should be ready to test soon."  
"备用插件系统尚未准备就绪，我们应该很快就能进行测试了。"

"How long?" "多久？"

"Magi reports at least a week until we can even prepare to upload any of the Agents core into it, at least two weeks before we can start on creating a replicate based on the uploaded data."  
"魔导报告称至少还需一周才能准备上传任何使徒核心，至少两周后才能基于上传数据开始制作复制体。"

"Have it ready as soon as possible, we will need a replacement on standby should anything happen to one of the Evas."  
"尽快准备好，一旦有任何一台 EVA 发生意外，我们需要立即有替补待命。"

"Understood." "明白了。"

Gendo turned and looked into the tank and smiled slightly, from inside the tank Rei looked up and smiled back. He spoke softly to her, a vast contrast from how he would usually sound when talking to people. It was almost like the way someone would talk to their young child.  
源堂转身望向水槽，微微一笑，水槽内的绫波丽抬头回以微笑。他轻声对她说话，与平时与人交谈的语气截然不同，几乎像是与年幼的孩子对话一般温柔。

"Rei, we are finished here, you can come out now."  
“丽，这里已经结束了，你现在可以出来了。”

"Yes." "是的。"

The LCL began to drain out of the tank as the back of it opened, Rei stepped out, her wet skin glistening in the harsh laboratory lights, and put on the clothes folded beside the tank. She just finished putting on her jacket when Gendo came beside her.  
LCL 开始从水槽中排出，水槽后部缓缓打开，丽踏出水槽，湿漉漉的皮肤在实验室刺眼的灯光下闪着光，她拿起水槽旁折叠好的衣服穿上。刚套上外套，源渡就走到了她身边。

"Rei, I want you to rejoin Agent Ikari and Sohryu as soon as possible. Just like we talked about, if any problems should arise you know what you need to do."  
“丽，我希望你尽快回到碇特工和惣流身边。就像我们之前讨论的那样，如果出现问题，你知道该怎么做。”

Rei lowered her eyes slightly, thinking about what he had just said. A wave of sadness washed over her as she uttered her next words.  
丽微微垂下眼帘，思索着他刚才的话。一股悲伤涌上心头，她轻声说出了接下来的话。

"Yes sir." "是的，长官。"

**Stooges Residence – 2230 hours  
斯图吉斯住宅 – 2230 小时**

Shinji almost wished he hadn't asked, the initial reaction struck more apprehension into him than any Angel probably could have done. Touji's reaction wasn't what scared him, Touji was perfectly calm and normal, well as normal as Touji could be. Instead what scared him was Kensuke's reaction, Kensuke had always been the geekier of the two. Touji could have his moments but he was always more of a jock growing up, it wasn't until later on in his teens that he turned his attention to computers. Kensuke had grown up that way. A self proclaimed military otaku and geek, Kensuke made it his sole goal to uncover the government conspiracy. What this conspiracy was even Shinji didn't know but it certainly wasn't related to Shinji's belief that the government was hiding the truth about alien life. Kensuke seemed overly keen to help Shinji with his work for the government, and taking down a security system did more than encourage his enthusiasm.  
真嗣几乎希望自己没有问出口，最初的反应比任何使徒可能带来的恐惧更让他不安。托基的反应并不吓人，他非常冷静和正常，嗯，至少是托基式的正常。真正让他害怕的是健介的反应，健介一直是两人中更书呆子的那个。托基有时也会这样，但他从小更多是个运动型的人，直到十几岁后期才把注意力转向电脑。健介则是从小就这样。一个自称军事宅和书呆子的人，健介的唯一目标就是揭露政府阴谋。这个阴谋是什么，连真嗣也不知道，但它肯定与真嗣认为政府隐瞒外星生命真相的信念无关。健介似乎对帮助真嗣完成政府工作异常热心，破解一个安全系统更是激发了他的热情。

Nonetheless they were both very talented and if Shinji wanted to get past the security system Spender had told him about, he was going to need their help. All three of them sat for a brief moment in silence, Touji looking at him, a serious expression on his face, Kensuke however was grinning. Shinji began to tell them the details of what was happening.  
尽管如此，他们俩都非常有才华，如果真嗣想要突破斯宾塞告诉他的安全系统，他需要他们的帮助。三人沉默地坐了一会儿，阿斯兰看着他，脸上带着严肃的表情，而真希波却在咧嘴笑。真嗣开始向他们详细讲述正在发生的事情。

"Ok, tomorrow meet me at Misato's apartment at half nine in the morning. Bring whatever equipment you think you'll need."  
“好，明天早上九点半在美里小姐的公寓见。带上你认为需要的任何设备。”

"Will Agent Sohryu be meeting us there?"  
“明日香特工会来和我们汇合吗？”

Shinji stopped for a moment, he still hadn't told Sohryu about it, something inside him told him he should but he wanted to take the credit for this one. He knew it was childish on his part but he wanted some measure of payback for her not telling him about the Angel in the first place.  
真嗣停顿了一下，他还没告诉惣流这件事，内心有个声音告诉他应该说出来，但他想独占这份功劳。他知道自己这样很幼稚，但他想要对她最初没有告诉他天使的事情进行一些报复。

"No, she's working on something else at the moment, that's why I need your help. I can't get in there alone."  
“不，她现在正在忙别的事情，所以我需要你的帮助。我一个人进不去那里。”

"Right, so what do you know about this place?" Kensuke questioned  
“好的，那你对这个地方了解多少？” 健介问道

"It's a mansion outside of town, fairly isolated, very well protected."  
"这是一座位于城郊的豪宅，相当孤立，保护措施非常严密。"

"Do we know anything about the security systems?"  
"我们对安全系统有什么了解吗？"

"CCTV, Electric fencing, alarm systems. The usual, probably all rigged up to give our suspect adequate time to detect and get away from us."  
"闭路电视、电网围栏、报警系统。常规配置，可能都设置好了，以便我们的嫌疑人有足够的时间察觉并逃离我们。"

"So you want us to deactivate the security, then what?" Kensuke said.  
“所以你是想让我们关闭安全系统，然后呢？” 真希波说。

"Then you stay and monitor me from afar, there's a small clearing giving you a good view of the house. I want you to hook me up with a small camera, if anything happens return to NERV and tell Misato immediately. Whatever you do, make sure you do not follow me in."  
“那你就在远处监视我，那里有一小块空地，视野很好，可以看到房子。我要你给我装一个小摄像头，如果有什么情况，立刻返回 NERV 告诉美里。无论如何，确保你不要跟着我进去。”

Kensuke looked almost dejected at being told not to follow Shinji in, he immediately noticed this.  
真希波听到不让他跟着真嗣进去，显得有些沮丧，他立刻注意到了这一点。

"It's for your own good, this person is extremely dangerous. I'll be armed when I go in, you two won't be if you follow me."  
"这是为你好，这个人极度危险。我进去时会带上武器，如果你们跟着我，就不会有武器在身。"

"I understand, some people get all the fun."  
"我明白，有些人总是能享受乐趣。"

Shinji lowered his eyes and mumbled slightly, "Believe me there's nothing fun about what I do."  
真嗣垂下眼帘，低声嘟囔道："相信我，我所做的事毫无乐趣可言。"

"That's what you always say, you get to run your own area though and you work with hot chicks like Misato and Sohryu."  
"你总是这么说，不过你确实能管理自己的地盘，还能和像美里和惣流这样的美女一起工作。"

Shinji stopped to correct him, "I don't run my own area, Misato is my superior, if anything she runs it and it's not so much our own area, it's just that me and Sohryu tend to be able to pick our own cases as we deal with the paranormal and extraterrestrial."  
真嗣停下来纠正他，“我并没有管理自己的地盘，美里是我的上司，实际上是她负责管理。我们并不是有自己的地盘，只是我和惣流处理超自然和外星事件时，通常能自己挑选案件。”

"Which is what you wanted right?"  
“这不就是你想要的吗？”

"I guess so…" "我想是的…"

Kensuke continued talking, sounding slightly annoyed at his friends' lack of enthusiasm.  
健介继续说着，听起来对他的朋友们缺乏热情有些不悦。

"Then what are you moaning about, don't you realize just how lucky you are. Just think if in one of your cases you finally find the answers not only you, but people like you and I, have been looking for. The proof that we need, doesn't that excite you a little bit?"  
"那你还在抱怨什么，难道你不明白自己有多幸运吗？想象一下，在你的某个案件中，你终于找到了不仅是你，还有像你我这样的人一直在寻找的答案。我们需要的证据，难道这不让你感到一丝兴奋吗？"

"I guess, I just never really thought of it like that."  
"我想，我只是从未真正这样想过。"

Touji cut in before Kensuke could go off anymore, "Kensuke stop, besides which I didn't think you liked NERV anyway?"  
东治在健司继续说下去之前打断了他，“健司，别说了，再说了，我也没觉得你喜欢 NERV 啊？”

"Well I… never mind." "嗯，我……算了。"

They all laughed and then went back to what they had to do the next day. Touji turned to Shinji and spoke. "We can do this, but do you really think its wise going in alone. Shouldn't you at least call for the red devils help?"  
他们全都笑了，然后回到第二天要做的事情上。冬二转向真嗣说道：“我们能做到，但你真的认为独自进去明智吗？你至少应该叫上红魔帮忙吧？”

"The red devil?" “红魔？”

Kensuke happily chimed in, "That's his name for Sohryu."  
剑介开心地插话道：“那是他对惣流的外号。”

"I see, no like I said she's busy on something else at the moment. I'll be fine, just as long as you two disable the security."  
"我明白了，就像我之前说的，她现在正忙着别的事情。我一个人没问题，只要你们俩能把安保系统搞定。"

"Its fine, don't worry about it, we'll get the job done."  
"没事的，别担心，我们会完成任务的。"

_8th July 2015 2015 年 7 月 8 日_

**Misato's Apartment - 0930  
美里公寓 - 0930**

'_Almost time'_ he thought to himself, he looked out across the city towards the outskirts where the mansion was located. Shinji was seriously considering not going through with it, what if Spender was wrong or what if he couldn't take Leliel out? All the other Angels he had someone with him to act as back up, either Asuka or Rei, this time he was acting alone. Sure he had Kensuke and Touji but if anything happened they wouldn't be able to do anything.  
他心想：‘快到时间了’，他望向城市边缘的那座庄园。真嗣认真考虑着是否要放弃这次行动，万一斯宾德搞错了，或者他无法消灭雷利尔怎么办？之前对付其他使徒时，他总有明日香或绫波陪伴作为后援，这次他却要独自行动。虽然有剑介和东治在，但万一出事，他们也帮不上忙。

Kensuke and Touji however were not having second thoughts about it, in fact they, or mostly Kensuke, were looking forward to the whole thing. They were setting up various pieces of equipment in the corner, Kensuke was stood over a laptop, Touji working with some sort of electronic device. Kensuke reached into a small case and pulled out a tiny camera calling over to Shinji.  
然而，剑介和东治对此毫无犹豫，实际上，主要是剑介，他们对此充满期待。他们在角落里安装各种设备，剑介站在笔记本电脑前，东治摆弄着某种电子装置。剑介从一个小箱子里拿出一个微型摄像头，朝真嗣喊道。

"Shinji over here, I want to test something."  
"这边，真嗣，我想测试点东西。"

Shinji nodded and walked over to where Kensuke was standing, Kensuke placed the small camera on Shinji's jacket telling him about how it works.  
真嗣点点头，走到健介站的地方，健介把一个小相机放在真嗣的夹克上，向他解释它的工作原理。

"Okay we have only tested this with a range of about twelve metres or so, so we don't know how well it'll work once you're inside the house. Also, with all the security we're expecting a lot of electrical interference blocking the cameras feed." He stopped speaking for a moment as he pulled a small headset from the case, "We also have this, a headset to keep in audio contact with you. I know you didn't ask for it but if we lose the camera feed its better than nothing."  
"好吧，我们只测试过大约十二米的范围，所以不知道你进屋后它会工作得怎么样。而且，考虑到所有的安保措施，我们预计会有很多电子干扰阻断相机的信号。"他停顿了一下，从盒子里拿出一个小耳机，"我们还有这个，一个耳机，用来保持音频联系。我知道你没要求，但如果我们失去了相机信号，总比没有好。"

Shinji nodded, taking the headset from him and putting it round his ear.  
真嗣点点头，从他手中接过头戴式耳机，戴在了自己的耳朵上。

"I understand." "我明白了。"

There was a slight sound of static over the headset and Kensuke spoke again, "Okay I've switched it on, can you hear me Shinji?"  
耳机里传来轻微的静电声，随后健介再次开口，“好了，我已经打开了，真嗣，你能听到我吗？”

Shinji shot his friend a glance and had to restrain himself from asking if he was stupid.  
真嗣瞥了朋友一眼，差点忍不住问他是不是傻。

"Kensuke I'm in the same room as you, if you wanted to test it don't you think you should have asked me to go into another room first?"  
"健介，我和你在同一个房间里，如果你想测试的话，难道不应该先让我去另一个房间吗？"

"Err yeah, never mind." "呃，是的，没关系。"

"Do you want me to go into another room?"  
"你想让我去另一个房间吗？"

"No it's fine, it picked up communication between the computer and the headset anyway. I'm all done, how about you Touji."  
"不，没关系，反正它已经捕捉到了电脑和耳机之间的通信。我已经完成了，你呢，冬二。"

Touji nodded and looked towards Shinji, waiting for him to give them the go ahead to begin taking everything to the car.  
冬二点点头，看向真嗣，等待他发出开始将所有东西搬到车上的信号。

"Okay, we'll start taking this stuff down now."  
"好的，我们现在就开始把这些东西搬下去。"

Both stooges nodded and began to place the machines back into the cases, in a matter of minutes they had everything packed away and were out of the flat, leaving Shinji to think about what could happen.  
两个跟班点点头，开始将机器重新装回箱子，不出几分钟，他们就把所有东西打包好并离开了公寓，留下真嗣思考可能发生的事情。

'_I guess this is it then, time to get this done.'_  
'看来就是这样了，是时候完成这件事了。'

He began to leave just as the phone began to ring, he contemplated picking it up but instead just left it and carried on towards the front door. Shinji stopped as the phone switched over to the answering machine, he held the door open for a brief moment trying to hear the other person. The pre-recorded message finished and immediately Asuka's voice came over, as soon as he heard her voice he turned and closed the door, unaware though that he was not there she continued speaking.  
他正要离开，电话铃声突然响起，他犹豫是否要接听，但最终还是任由它响着，继续走向前门。真嗣在电话转到答录机时停了下来，他打开门，短暂地停留试图听清对方的声音。预录的留言结束，紧接着传来明日香的声音，一听到她的声音，他立刻转身关上门，却未察觉她并不在那里，她继续说着话。

"_Shinji, it's Sohryu I don't know if you're still there. I just spoke with Katsuragi and she said you're at her home and will be in slightly late. Kaji contacted me and gave me a location for Leliel but he said we can't approach him, he didn't say why but he said it'll only cause more problems if one of us gets near him."_  
“真嗣，我是惣流。不知道你还在不在。我刚和葛城小姐通了电话，她说你现在在她家，会稍微晚点到。加持给了我 Leliel 的位置，但他告诫我们不能靠近，没说为什么，只说如果我们中的任何一个接近他，只会引发更多问题。”

**House – 1012 hours 住宅 – 10 点 12 分**

Shinji looked up at the house, it was larger than he imagined it was going to be, if he had to guess there must have been over fifteen rooms in there and he had to search through each and every one of them. He stepped out of the car and attached the small camera to his jacket. Beside him Touji was unravelling a set of cables and speaking to Shinji.  
真嗣抬头望向那座房子，比他预想的要大得多，如果他没猜错的话，里面肯定有超过十五个房间，他得逐一搜查。他走出车外，将小型相机固定在夹克上。身旁的东治正在解开一卷电缆，并对真嗣说着话。

"So this suspect of yours is in there?"  
"这么说，你那个嫌疑人在里面？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"Huge place for just one guy."  
"这么大的地方就为了一个人。"

Shinji nodded, not really taking any notice of his friend's words. He watched both of them silently as they set up their equipment. Shinji was amazed at how quick they were able to set it all up. So many pieces of equipment there and they were able to connect it all together and set it up in only a matter of minutes.  
真嗣点点头，并没有真正注意到朋友的话。他默默地看着他们安装设备。真嗣惊讶于他们能如此迅速地完成这一切。这么多设备，他们居然能在几分钟内全部连接好并安装完毕。

"We're all set up here, it's up to you now Shinji."  
"我们已经准备就绪，接下来就看你的了，真嗣。"

"Right, what about the security systems?"  
"好的，那安全系统呢？"

"Nothing tasking, it's split up into several quadrants around the house. Mostly just CCTV systems though, the gate is also hooked up to the camera system so we'll need to deactivate the security on that as well."  
"没什么复杂的，房子周围分成了几个区域。主要是一些闭路电视系统，大门也连接到了摄像系统，所以我们还需要关闭那里的安全措施。"

"How long should that take?"  
“那需要多长时间？”

Kensuke grinned from behind his screen, "Are you kidding? It's done, it was no problem at all. Bang, straight in and then it was deactivated."  
健介在屏幕后咧嘴一笑，“你在开玩笑吧？已经搞定了，一点问题都没有。砰，直接进去，然后就解除了。”

Something was wrong, Shinji felt it immediately. It shouldn't have been that easy. A sickening sense of apprehension crept into his as he made sure what Kensuke had said was correct.  
有什么不对劲，真嗣立刻感觉到了。这不应该这么容易。一种令人不安的预感悄然涌上心头，他确认健介所说的是否属实。

"Are you sure it's deactivated?" he asked "I didn't think it would be that easy?"  
"你确定它已经停用了吗？" 他问道，"我没想到会这么简单。"

Touji chimed in quickly, not giving Kensuke a chance to double check. "I think you're underestimating us there Shinji, you've got nothing to worry about. It's down."  
东治迅速插话，不给真希斗再次检查的机会。"我觉得你低估我们了，真嗣，你不用担心。它已经关掉了。"

Shinji nodded, still not entirely confident but it was too late for him to turn back now.  
真嗣点点头，尽管他仍然不完全放心，但现在回头已经太迟了。

"If something happens, remember don't follow me in, go back to NERV instead."  
"如果发生什么事，记住不要跟着我进去，回 NERV 去。"

"What should we say if something does happen?"  
"如果真的发生了什么事，我们该怎么说？"

"If you see Katsuragi tell her exactly what happened, and if you see Sohryu…tell her I'm sorry."  
"如果你见到葛城，就告诉她发生了什么，如果见到惣流……告诉她我很抱歉。"

"What do you mean sorry?"  
“你说的‘对不起’是什么意思？”

It was too late. Shinji was already out of view. They could have asked him again over the microphone but instead decided to save that for more important issues. Both of them looked on the screen as they watched Shinji making his way up to the mansion gate. Just as they expected, it opened with no hassle allowing him inside.  
为时已晚，真嗣已经消失在视线中。他们本可以通过麦克风再次询问他，但最终决定将这一机会留给更重要的议题。两人盯着屏幕，看着真嗣向庄园大门走去。正如他们所料，大门毫无阻碍地为他敞开，让他顺利进入。

Shinji quickly ran up towards the front entrance of the house and looked around, making sure there was nothing else there. Kensuke and Touji watched him on the screen as he slowly opened the door and made his way into the house. He entered a corridor and began moving slowly, they could see he had his gun drawn and aimed directly ahead.  
真嗣迅速跑向房屋的前门，环顾四周，确保没有其他异常。屏幕前的健介和透治注视着他缓缓推开门，步入屋内。他进入了一条走廊，开始缓慢前行，他们能看到他手持枪械，直指前方。

Shinji stopped moving, for a brief moment they saw two other people on screen. The first an old man with grey hair, like anybody's Grandfather, but the second of the two could not be seen as he wore some sort of strange device over his face. That was where the feed stopped, Shinji began to speak but the audio link cut off as well. Both Kensuke and Touji looked at each other frantically, shouting out loudly.  
真嗣停下了动作，屏幕上短暂地出现了另外两个人。第一个是位灰白头发的老人，就像任何人的祖父一样，但第二个人却因为脸上戴着某种奇怪的装置而无法看清。画面到此中断，真嗣开始说话，但音频链接也随即切断了。健介和渡志慌张地对视，大声呼喊起来。

"What's going on?" “发生了什么？”

Touji quickly replied, "I don't know, we've lost the feed"  
渡志迅速回应道：“我不知道，信号断了。”

**House Interior 室内场景**

Shinji entered the house, his heart pounding, beneath his jacket he grasped his pistol ready for whatever might be round the next corner. From above there was the hum of machinery, he withdrew the pistol and began moving forwards. He turned the corner into another corridor, noticing that there were no doors leading to anywhere else, just a long corridor extending off into the darkness.  
真嗣走进屋内，心跳如鼓，外套下紧握着手枪，随时准备应对下一个转角可能出现的任何情况。上方传来机械的嗡鸣声，他拔出手枪，开始向前移动。转过拐角进入另一条走廊，注意到这里没有通往其他地方的门，只有一条长长的走廊延伸进黑暗中。

He moved forward a few paces into the darkness, with each step he took it got significantly darker. His steps echoed all around him almost as if he had walking on a metal surface, still focused he continued walking. There was no way he could have turned back now, he reached into his jacket trying to find his pocket torch, cursing as it fell to the floor. Shinji kneeled down and felt the floor, it was metal he felt around for the torch, he froze as he felt a sudden presence directly ahead of him. The shadow of two figures loomed over him.  
他向前走了几步，踏入黑暗，每走一步，四周就变得更加昏暗。他的脚步声在四周回响，仿佛走在金属表面上，他依然全神贯注地继续前行。此刻已无法回头，他伸手进外套摸索口袋里的手电筒，却咒骂着让它掉落在地。真嗣跪下，触摸地面，是金属的，他四处摸索寻找手电筒，突然感到前方有股突如其来的存在感，让他僵住了。两个身影的阴影笼罩在他上方。

He aimed his gun at the one closest to him but lowered it upon seeing who it was, "You?"  
他举枪对准离他最近的那个人，但看清对方是谁后，放下了枪，“是你？”

Spender looked back at Shinji, a twisted smile on his face. In one of his hands was a cigarette, he took a drag and exhaled. Shinji stared directly into his eyes, wanting to shoot, but frozen in place only able to blink and speak. He turned from Spender to the other figure, the other person was slightly larger than Spender and was wearing a strange device over his face. Shinji could only assume this person was Leliel.  
斯宾德回头看向真嗣，脸上挂着扭曲的笑容。他一只手里夹着香烟，吸了一口又吐出烟雾。真嗣直视着他的眼睛，想要开枪却动弹不得，只能眨眼和说话。他转向斯宾德旁边的另一个人，那人比斯宾德稍高一些，脸上戴着奇怪的面罩。真嗣只能猜测这人是雷利尔。

He stepped forward and began injecting something into Shinji's neck, a strange numbing sensation began to spread from Shinji's neck throughout the rest of his body. Shinji continued staring straight on at Spender as he slumped his knees, his body completely frozen.  
他走上前，开始往真嗣的脖子上注射某种东西，一种奇怪的麻木感从真嗣的脖子蔓延至全身。真嗣继续直视着斯宾德，双膝一软，身体完全僵住了。

Spender had led him here, told him to come here only to lead him into this trap. He managed to stutter out. "You…you lied to me."  
斯宾德把他引到这里，让他来这里只是为了设下这个陷阱。他勉强结巴着说：“你……你骗了我。”

"No Ikari I didn't lie, I just didn't tell you the whole truth."  
"不，碇，我没有撒谎，我只是没有告诉你全部真相。"

**House Exterior 房屋外观**

Touji finished speaking and there was a loud roar from directly above them, everything around them faded to black as a light began to erupt from the house and directly above them. They both shielded their eyes and looked up, both looking on in shock, from behind them they thought they could hear the screeching of tires but they were transfixed on the moving craft above them. It was a giant metallic structure, spotlights scanning the area and what appeared to be huge doorways opening. Both of them tried to peer into the openings, seeing nothing but a bright light. It was almost spherical in shape, but covered most of the area they were in, causing complete darkness to all areas not lit up by the spotlights, as it moved there were huge roars like thunder.  
当东治说完话，他们头顶突然传来一声巨响，周围的一切渐渐陷入黑暗，一束光芒从房子里爆发出来，直射天际。两人都用手遮住眼睛，抬头望去，震惊地看着上方移动的飞行器。那是一个巨大的金属结构，探照灯扫视着四周，巨大的门似乎正在打开。他们试图透过开口窥视，却只看到一片耀眼的光芒。这个飞行器几乎呈球形，覆盖了他们所在的大部分区域，使得未被探照灯照亮的地方完全陷入黑暗，随着它的移动，巨大的轰鸣声如同雷鸣般响起。

Kensuke shouted fearfully, "That's…. They're…."  
健介惊恐地喊道：“那是……它们……”

"What is this?" “这是什么？”

There was a huge flash, blinding them both, and everything had gone, the craft, the light, everything. It was only them and the house in front of them; their equipment working once again, the visual feed showing the corridor Shinji had been in, the audio link feeding them only static.  
一道巨大的闪光出现，使他们两人都目眩神迷，一切都不见了，飞行器、光芒，所有的一切。只剩下他们和面前的房子；他们的设备再次运转，视觉信号显示着真嗣所在的那条走廊，音频链接却只传来静电噪音。

"Is he…?" "他是在…？"

"I don't know, should we go in?"  
"我不知道，我们要进去吗？"

"He said not to follow him though."  
"但他说过不要跟着他。"

"We can't just leave him Touji, he's our friend and besides we need to be sure."  
"我们不能就这样丢下他，冬二，他是我们的朋友，而且我们得确认一下。"

A shadow appeared over them both, they turned and found themselves looking directly at Asuka. She was staring straight ahead at the house and then down to the two of them, she spoke calmly.  
一个影子笼罩了他们俩，他们转身发现自己正面对着明日香。她直视着房子，然后低头看向他们两人，语气平静地说道。

"Did he go in?" "他进去了吗？"

They nodded unable to say anything.  
他们点头，无法说出任何话。

"I'm going inside." She said simply  
“我要进去了。”她简单地说道。

Both of them tried to make a move to stop her, she quickly moved past them though and went towards the house. They quickly got up and followed her, entering the house alongside her. They entered the first corridor in silence when they turned into the corridor Shinji had been in. Asuka turned to them both and questioned them.  
两人试图阻止她，但她迅速从他们身边走过，朝房子走去。他们迅速起身跟随她，与她一同进入屋内。他们无声地进入第一个走廊，当他们转入真嗣所在的走廊时，明日香转向他们两人，质问道。

"Is there where he last was?"  
"这就是他最后所在的地方吗？"

They nodded again, Kensuke however stepped forward and picked up the camera and headset examining them.  
他们再次点头，但 Kensuke 走上前，捡起相机和耳机仔细检查。

"They've been completely burnt out, both devices."  
"这两个设备都被彻底烧毁了。"

Asuka looked down at him, "What by?"  
明日香低头看着他，“什么东西？”

"I don't know, probably that thing that just flew over the mansion."  
“我不知道，可能是刚刚飞过宅邸的那个东西。”

"What thing?" “什么东西？”

"The huge…whatever it was that just hovered above us causing that light. Didn't you see it?"  
"那个巨大的……不管它是什么，刚刚在我们头顶上盘旋，引起那道光。你没看见吗？"

Asuka paused for a moment, she had seen it but she didn't want to believe she had just seen it.  
明日香停顿了一下，她的确看到了，但她不愿相信自己真的看到了。

'_Yes I saw it, and it took Shinji.'_  
'是的，我看到了，它带走了真嗣。'

"I don't know what I just saw, whatever happened Shinji isn't here anymore, we should leave."  
"我不知道我刚才看到了什么，无论发生了什么，真嗣已经不在这里了，我们应该离开。"

Kensuke looked at the devices and then to Asuka, he was no expert on people but he could tell she wanted to be alone for a few moments. "We'll take quick look in some of the other rooms first."  
健介看了看设备，然后转向明日香，他虽然不是人际关系专家，但他能看出她想独自待一会儿。“我们先去其他房间快速查看一下。”

She exited the house first, the realization hitting her like a tonne of bricks, he was gone, he had vanished, taken by whatever was in there. She looked up at the house desperately, almost expecting the structure to give her an answer as to what had happened. A burning sensation began to stir from the pit of her stomach up to the backs of her eyes, she blinked several times trying to keep her composure. Silently she stood for a few moments before clenching her fist tightly and driving it straight through the first window she saw. For a moment she felt nothing only anger, she lifted her hand up to her face watching the blood begin to trickle down. She brought her hand back again and this time slapped her palm against the wall.  
她率先走出房子，这个事实像一吨砖头一样砸向她，他消失了，他不见了，被里面的东西带走了。她绝望地抬头看着房子，几乎期待着这栋建筑能给她一个答案。一股灼热感从她的胃部开始，一直涌到眼后，她眨了几次眼，试图保持镇定。她默默地站了一会儿，然后紧紧握拳，猛地砸向她看到的第一个窗户。有那么一刻，她只感到愤怒，她抬起手，看着血开始滴落。她再次将手收回，这一次，她用手掌拍向墙壁。

"You goddamn idiot Shinji." Asuka screamed  
“你这个该死的白痴真嗣。”明日香尖叫道

She felt a presence behind her and turned only to find herself face to face with Shinji's friends. She spat out at them, "What do you want?"  
她感觉到身后有人，转身一看，却发现自己正面对着真嗣的朋友们。她朝他们吐了口唾沫，“你们想干什么？”

They were still in a slight state of shock after learning Shinji had been taken, Kensuke managed to stammer out, "W-We were just wondering if you were alright."  
得知真嗣被带走后，他们仍处于轻微的震惊之中，剑介勉强结巴着说：“我们只是想知道你还好吗。”

"I'm fine, it's that idiot you should be worried about."  
"我没事，你该担心的是那个傻瓜。"

"So what do we do now?"  
"那我们现在怎么办？"

She didn't know, something inside her made her want to go back inside the house to keep searching until they found anything from the craft to Shinji himself, the other more dominant part only tried to bury that feeling.  
她不知道，内心某种力量驱使她想回到屋里继续寻找，直到找到从飞船到真嗣的任何线索，而另一个更占主导的部分则试图压抑这种感觉。

"We go back to NERV and tell Katsuragi about how her precious Shinji tried to play the hero only to get himself captured. I don't care anymore, he got what he deserved."  
“我们回 NERV，告诉葛城她宝贝的真嗣如何试图逞英雄，结果反被抓。我再也不在乎了，他活该。”

**NERV Offices NERV 办公室**

Misato looked up from her desk in surprise and anger, not only had Agent Sohryu just made her way into the office but she had brought two unauthorised people into the office with her, interrupting a conversation between her and Kaji. She glared at the three of them, immediately questioning their presence.  
葛城从办公桌前抬起头，惊讶又愤怒，不仅草薙特务突然闯进办公室，还带了两个未经授权的人进来，打断了她和加持的谈话。她瞪着这三人，立刻质疑他们的出现。

"What is the meaning of this? Sohryu what are you doing bringing two unauthorised civilians in here?"  
"这是什么意思？惣流，你带两个未经授权的平民来这里做什么？"

Asuka stepped forward and began to explain, "They're Shinji's friends."  
明日香走上前开始解释，"他们是真嗣的朋友。"

"I know who they are but what are they doing here and where is Shinji?"  
"我知道他们是谁，但他们来这里做什么，真嗣又在哪里？"

"H...He's gone, he entered the house and something happened, we searched the area but there was no sign of him."  
"他...他进屋了，然后发生了什么事，我们搜遍了周围，但一点他的踪迹都没有。"

The anger dropped from Misato's face only to be replaced by pure shock.  
愤怒从美里脸上消失，取而代之的是纯粹的震惊。

"W..What do you mean?" "你...你这是什么意思？"

"He went after Leliel alone…something happened, I don't know what, but he's gone."  
"他独自去追击雷里尔了……发生了什么事，我不知道具体，但他失踪了。"

Kaji stepped forward putting his arm around Misato and looking at the three of them, his face deadly serious.  
加持走上前，将手臂搭在美里肩上，目光严肃地看着他们三人。

"He went after Leliel alone?"  
"他独自去追击雷里尔了？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"This isn't good, you two come with me. Asuka stay here with Katsuragi and tell her what happened. We need to find him."  
"这不太妙，你们俩跟我来。明日香留在这里和葛城小姐说明情况。我们必须找到他。"

"Right." “好的。”

Kaji exited the room, Kensuke and Touji following behind him. Misato stood up teary eyed and made her way round her desk to Asuka. Asuka looked ahead, an expression of anger on her face.  
加持离开了房间，真希波和东治紧随其后。美里泪眼婆娑地站起身，绕过办公桌走向明日香。明日香直视前方，脸上带着愤怒的表情。

"Why…?" "为什么…？"

Asuka had no reason to give, she instead repeated what she had said to Kensuke and Touji, shocking the woman in front of her.  
明日香没有任何理由可以给出，她只是重复了对真希波和东治说过的话，这让面前的女人震惊不已。

"The idiot deserved it running off like that, he only has himself to blame."  
“那个白痴活该，他那样跑掉只能怪他自己。”

Misato stepped back slightly and delivered a slap directly across Asuka's face. She watched as the woman quickly brought her hand up to her cheek and looked at her, hatred burning in her eyes. Misato wanted to reach out and choke the life out of her, to kill her for what she had just said. She shouted at the Agent.  
美里稍稍后退，直接给了明日香一记耳光。她看着明日香迅速用手捂住脸颊，眼中燃烧着仇恨地盯着她。美里真想伸出手掐死她，就因为她刚才说的话而杀了她。她对着特工大喊道。

"How the fuck can you say something like that, you don't understand anything about him!"  
"你怎么能说出那种话，你对他的了解一无所知！"

"How can you justify what he done? He's an idiot and you know it. You can try to somehow justify it just because you were his guardian but you know he only has himself to blame."  
"你怎么能为他所做的事辩解？他是个白痴，你心知肚明。你试图为他开脱，只因为你曾是他的监护人，但你清楚他只能怪他自己。"

Misato promptly slapped her again and ran out of the office, not daring to say anything else. Asuka glared at the door as Misato slammed it shut, her eyes burning. The redhead then dropped to her knees, tears rolling down her cheek as she whispered his name. "Shinji…"  
美里立刻又扇了她一巴掌，然后跑出了办公室，不敢再说什么。明日香瞪着被美里猛然关上的门，眼中燃烧着怒火。红发少女随后跪倒在地，泪水顺着脸颊滑落，她低声呼唤着他的名字。"真嗣……"

### Chapter 17 Future Ain't What It Used To Be

'_What is this? Where am I?'_  
“这是哪里？我在哪儿？”

Complete darkness stretching out for all eternity. Shinji felt himself falling through it, an infinite space in which he was the only one to inhabit it. Suddenly there was a sudden jerking movement, like a train coming to a complete halt. The falling sensation was gone, only to be replaced by the feeling of him floating. Slowly, he felt his body being turned into a standing position by an unknown force. Beneath his feet felt solid, feeling like a concrete floor, yet was still the same empty darkness as before.  
无尽的黑暗，仿佛永恒地延伸。真嗣感觉自己在这无垠的空间中坠落，唯有他一人存在。突然间，一阵剧烈的晃动袭来，如同列车骤然停下。坠落感消失了，取而代之的是漂浮的感觉。慢慢地，他感到一股未知的力量将他的身体转至站立的姿势。脚下感觉坚实，像是混凝土地面，但四周依旧是那片空洞的黑暗。

"Hello?" “喂？”

His voice echoed throughout the vastness. He shouted again to be met with only his own echoes as a response. His hands clenched into a fist and unclenched as he stood looking for anything that might exist in the void. The realization hit him, he was completely alone, there was no one, there was nothing there except him and the endless nothingness. He suddenly began to feel intolerably lonely as he dropped to his knees.  
他的声音在广阔的空间中回荡。他再次呼喊，回应他的只有自己的回声。他的双手紧握成拳，又松开，站在那里寻找着虚空中可能存在的任何事物。他意识到，自己完全孤独，那里没有人，没有任何东西，只有他和无尽的虚无。他突然感到难以忍受的孤独，跪倒在地。

He hit his fist off the floor shouting out again, "Where am I? What do you want with me?"  
他一拳砸向地面，再次喊道：“我在哪里？你们想对我做什么？”

Again only the echoes of his own voice answered back. He hit the floor again in rage only for this time it to feel as if he was plunging his hand into ice cold water. He yelled out in surprise and withdrew his hand. Clutching it tightly to his chest, he peered back to where he had just drove it beforehand. Strangely, he was met by his own reflection, he peered at it, his own blue eyes peering right back at him. He blinked, his reflection still there, only now there was something else, another person, a female with red hair and blue eyes. He quickly span round still crouched and shouted.  
回应他的依旧是自己的回声。他愤怒地再次击打地面，这次却感觉像是把手伸进了冰冷的水中。他惊叫一声，迅速抽回手。紧握着受伤的手，他凝视着刚才击打的地方。奇怪的是，他看到了自己的倒影，那双蓝色的眼睛正回望着他。他眨了眨眼，倒影依旧存在，只是现在多了一个人，一个红发蓝眼的女子。他迅速转身，依然蹲着，大声喊道。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

She gave no response, only staring darkly at him. He stood up looking her in the eyes. She was real, and she was standing in front of him, but how? How could she just appear like that? He questioned her again.  
她没有回应，只是阴沉地盯着他。他站起身来，直视她的眼睛。她是真实的，就站在他面前，但怎么可能？她怎么能就这样出现？他再次质问她。

"Asuka is that you? How did you…?"He swallowed. How didn't matter. "What is this place?"  
“明日香，是你吗？你怎么……？”他咽了咽口水。怎么来的并不重要。“这是什么地方？”

She whispered, "Coward." 她低声说：“懦夫。”

"What…What do you mean?" "什……什么意思？"

She moved towards him, repeating the word again. "Coward."  
她向他走去，再次重复那个词。"懦夫。"

"I...I don't know what you mean."  
"我……我不明白你的意思。"

"You know exactly what I mean, look at you, you're pathetic. You want the truth, you want people to help you, yet you run away from them at every opportunity and look where it's gotten you."  
"你完全明白我的意思，看看你自己，真是可悲。你想要真相，想要别人帮你，可你每次都逃避他们，看看这把你带到了什么地步。"

"Asuka I…I'm not, I haven't…" Shinji stuttered.  
"明日香，我……我没有，我并没有……" 真嗣结巴地说。"

"Don't try to cover it up Shinji. All we tried to do was help you in your quest yet you refused us. I tried to help you and you refused it, choosing to go off on the words of some guy you only spoke to once."  
"别试图掩饰了，真嗣。我们一直想帮你完成你的使命，但你拒绝了。我试图帮你，你也拒绝了，宁愿听信一个只说过一次话的人的话。"

Shinji shouted back angrily, "You went behind my back first, you knew it was an Angel, you knew all along and said nothing. What was I supposed to do?"  
"真嗣愤怒地回喊道：“是你先背着我行动的，你知道那是使徒，你一直都知道却什么都没说。我该怎么办？””

Asuka's expression softened slightly as she spoke back, "Talk to me?"  
"明日香的神情稍稍缓和了一些，她回应道：“跟我谈谈？””

"How could I have spoke to you, you betrayed me you…you're the one who ran away from me after Mattariel"  
"“我怎么可能跟你谈，你背叛了我，你……在马特里艾尔之后你逃离了我””

Shinji was suddenly made aware of another voice behind him,  
真嗣突然意识到身后传来另一个声音，

"And what about me?" “那我呢？”

The Asuka in front of him faded away, he spun around looking at the new person, "Misato?"  
眼前的明日香逐渐消失，他转身看向新出现的人，“美里？”

"You could have come to me Shinji but you didn't, you _are_ a coward."  
"你本可以来找我的，真嗣，但你没有，你是个懦夫。"

There was a horrible, cold maliciousness to her voice. A deliberate accusatory tone that seemed so un-Misatolike, it terrified Shinji to the bone.  
她的声音中带着一种可怕、冰冷的恶意。那种故意的指责语气，与美里平时的风格如此不符，让真嗣感到骨子里都发寒。

"No, I'm not I just…I wanted to see, to prot…"  
"不，我不是，我只是……我想看看，想保护……"

"You wanted to protect me? Bullshit! You just wanted to cover yourself, you wanted to do it yourself because if anyone else got involved it'd take away from your achievement, you egotistical bastard."  
"你想保护我？胡说八道！你只是想掩盖自己，你想亲自去做，因为如果别人插手，就会削弱你的成就，你这个自大的混蛋。"

"No, that's not true." He whined. "I didn't want you to get hurt."  
"不，那不是真的。"" 他哀怨地说。""我不想你受伤。"

"Oh so that's it is it? But you don't care what happens afterwards to you, you just put yourself first. You don't want people to get hurt so you don't have to feel the guilt, is that it?"  
"哦，所以就是这样吗？但你不在乎之后你自己会怎样，你只顾自己优先。你不希望别人受伤，这样你就不必感到内疚，是吗？"

His voice was breaking up slightly as he replied. "No it's not, that's not true."  
他的声音略显破碎，回答道：“不，不是这样的，那不是真的。”

"Liar" “骗子”

A third voice appeared in the area this time to Shinji's right, the Misato in front of him faded just as Asuka had. He turned to meet the new voice, this one belonging to Rei Ayanami.  
第三个声音出现在真嗣右侧，面前的美里如同之前的明日香一样消失了。他转身面对这个新声音，这次是绫波零。

"You want to uncover the truth, yet you run away from it. You want to grow close to people, yet you run away from them. You wish you could be alone, yet when you are you wish for others. Do you even know what you want?"  
"你想要揭露真相，却又逃避它。你想要与人亲近，却又逃离他们。你希望独处，却又在孤独时渴望他人。你真的知道自己想要什么吗？"

"Ayanami I…what's happening to me, what is this place?"  
"绫波零……我这是怎么了，这里是什么地方？"

"This is your new reality Shinji."  
"这是你的新现实，真嗣。"

Shinji became aware of another presence behind him, he turned to see Rei again, only slightly older this time. He recognized the person immediately, it wasn't Rei it was the woman he had seen in the forest when the light swept over him. She was almost identical to Rei only older and with brown hair.  
真嗣察觉到身后有另一个存在，他转身一看，又是绫波，只是这次稍微年长了一些。他立刻认出了那个人，不是绫波，而是他在森林中光芒扫过时见到的那个女人。她和绫波几乎一模一样，只是年纪更大，头发是棕色的。

"M-Mother?" “妈、妈妈？”

_23rd September 9 月 23 日_

**Mansion – 0930 hours 庄园 – 0930 时**

His eyes shot open suddenly but the rest of his body refused to move, slowly the room began to come into focus, or at least the ceiling did, followed by a low beeping noise. He blinked twice and again attempted to move, slowly and painfully he turned his head towards the source of the incessant beeping. Shinji realized he was hooked up to some monitor, his eyes followed the pulse monitor flashing from left to right. He turned his head the other way, looking out of a window over an unfamiliar scene. The window was open, a gentle breeze blowing the curtains slightly and reaching him. As the feeling returned to the rest of his body he began to look around the room from the bed. It was a small comfort to him that he wasn't actually in a hospital room.  
他的眼睛突然睁开，但身体的其他部分却拒绝动弹。渐渐地，房间开始聚焦，至少天花板是如此，随后传来一阵低沉的哔哔声。他眨了两次眼，再次尝试移动，缓慢而痛苦地将头转向那持续不断的哔哔声来源。真嗣意识到自己被连接到了某个监测器上，他的目光随着脉搏监测器从左到右闪烁。他转过头，望向窗外，映入眼帘的是一个陌生的景象。窗户敞开着，一阵微风轻轻吹动窗帘，拂过他的脸庞。随着身体其他部位的感觉逐渐恢复，他开始从床上环视房间。令他稍感安慰的是，这里并非医院病房。

"You…You're awake?" “你……你醒了？”

Shinji was so wrapped up in wondering where he was, he hadn't noticed the door to the room opening and a woman stepping side. Shinji turned to the source of the voice and took a look, she was dressed in blue jeans and wearing a white t-shirt, her blond hair coming down to her shoulders and she was smiling at him.  
真嗣完全沉浸在思考自己身在何处，以至于没有注意到房间的门已经打开，一位女士走了进来。真嗣转向声音的来源，仔细一看，她穿着蓝色牛仔裤，白色 T 恤，金色的头发披肩而下，正对着他微笑。

"I can't believe you're finally awake, I've got to tell father, stay right there."  
“真不敢相信你终于醒了，我得去告诉父亲，待在那儿别动。”

Shinji began to reply, "Wait who ar…" He stopped when he saw she had already gone, "Never mind…"  
真嗣正要回答，“等等，你是谁…”他停了下来，因为她已经离开了，“算了…”

Painfully, he eased himself up taking a better look around the room. Besides his bed were two seats, one of which had a set of clothes on. They were nothing special, just basic jeans and a shirt, he moved his hand out towards them wondering what this place was.  
他痛苦地缓缓起身，更仔细地打量着房间。除了他的床，还有两把椅子，其中一把上放着一套衣服。这些衣服很普通，就是简单的牛仔裤和衬衫，他伸出手去拿，心中疑惑这是什么地方。

'_How did I get here, the last thing I remember was being in that place after seeing Leliel and…'_  
'我是怎么来到这里的，我记得的最后一件事是在那个地方，看到雷里尔之后……'

"Spender…" “斯宾瑟……”

Shinji felt rage build up inside him. He wanted to jump out of the bed, run across the room and kill the old man now standing in the doorway. The way he said Spender's name also seemed to give off that impression. Both Spender and the young woman from before entered the room, the woman sat on the empty seat next to Shinji's bed and placed her hand on his forehead making him lie back down. Spender however walked over to the window, opening the doorway to the balcony and lighting a cigarette, much to the young woman's disdain.  
真嗣感到怒火在心中升腾。他想要跳下床，冲过房间，当场杀死那个现在正站在门口的老头。他提到斯宾塞名字的方式也似乎传达了这种感觉。斯宾塞和之前那位年轻女子走进房间，女子坐在真嗣床边的空位上，把手放在他的额头上让他躺回去。而斯宾塞则走到窗前，打开通往阳台的门，点燃了一支烟，这让年轻女子颇为不满。

"Father you shouldn't smoke in here, I've told you that before."  
“父亲，您不应该在这里抽烟，我之前就跟您说过。”

"I'm sure Shinji doesn't mind Rebecca, he'll have more important things on his mind right now, won't you Shinji?"  
“我相信真嗣不会介意的，丽贝卡，他现在有更重要的事情要考虑，不是吗，真嗣？”

Rebecca looked from both her father to Shinji and placed a hand on Shinji's shoulder, stopping him from moving. Shinji felt so pathetic being unable to move and being pinned down by a single hand. The only thing he could do was mutter a weak 'Yes'.  
丽贝卡从父亲和真嗣之间扫视了一眼，将手放在真嗣的肩上，阻止了他移动。真嗣感到自己如此可悲，无法动弹，被一只手就压制住了。他唯一能做的就是微弱地应了一声‘是’。

"Rebecca if you'll leave us for a moment, me and Shinji have quite a bit to discuss here."  
“丽贝卡，如果你能暂时离开一下，我和真嗣有些事情需要讨论。”

She nodded and smiled at Shinji, "It's good to finally see you awake, we were beginning to think you'd never awaken."  
她点了点头，对真嗣微笑道，“很高兴终于看到你醒来了，我们开始担心你永远不会醒来了。”

She stood up and left the room, Shinji watched her close the door and propped himself up again turning to face Spender, not quite sure of what to ask the man first.  
她站起身离开了房间，真嗣看着她关上门，再次撑起自己，转向斯宾德，不太确定要先问这个人什么。

"Who are you?" “你是谁？”

Spender laughed and faced back out of the window, "Not quite the first question I expect from you. I believe I owe you an explanation though." he said, before taking a long and clearly satisfying drag from his cigarette. "Tell me what the last thing you remember is?"  
斯宾德笑了，转回望向窗外，“这可不是我预料中你会问的第一个问题。不过，我想我确实欠你一个解释。”他说着，深深吸了一口烟，显然很满足。“告诉我，你最后记得的是什么？”

Shinji glared at him, not sure if this was his sick idea of a joke. But still, he went along with it for the moment. "I was inside the location you had given me, I moved into some sort of corridor and everything began to get dark. Somehow it changed, the floor changed to metal, I looked up and there you were standing beside Leliel," Shinji shivered, a cauldron of rage simmering as he clenched his fist.  
真嗣瞪着他，不确定这是否是他病态的玩笑。但眼下，他还是顺着话题继续。“我按照你给的地点进去，走进了一条走廊，然后周围开始变暗。不知怎么的，环境变了，地板变成了金属，我抬头一看，你就站在雷利尔旁边，”真嗣打了个寒颤，怒火中烧，紧握拳头。

"You betrayed me! You lead me into a trap!"  
"你背叛了我！你把我引入陷阱！"

Shinji was aware he was shouting but didn't care, shouting was all he could do at this moment.  
真嗣知道自己在大喊，但他不在乎，此刻他只能通过喊叫来表达。

"I see," the smoking man remained calm. "Shinji, are you aware of whom that young woman is who was inside the room just now?"  
"我明白了，"抽烟的男人保持冷静。"真嗣，你知道刚才房间里的那位年轻女子是谁吗？"

"No and I don't care."  
"不，我不在乎。"

"Shinji, that woman is my daughter Rebecca. She's nineteen at the moment and has had quite the thing for you since you were brought here. She's visited you every single day since you came here, hoping you'd wake up so she could thank you."  
"真嗣，那位女士是我的女儿丽贝卡。她现在十九岁，自从你被带到这儿以来，她就一直对你有好感。自从你来到这里，她每天都来看望你，希望你能醒来，好亲自向你道谢。"

Shinji looked over at the door and then back to Spender, not quite sure what to think. The young girl wanted to thank Shinji, what for? What did she have to be thankful about, they had never met each other and Shinji certainly felt he hadn't done anything worth thanking for?  
真嗣朝门口看了一眼，然后又转向斯宾德，不太确定该怎么想。这个小女孩想感谢真嗣，为什么呢？她有什么好感谢的，他们从未见过面，真嗣也觉得自己没做过什么值得感谢的事？

"Why? I haven't done anything for anyone to be thankful to me for."  
"为什么？我并没有为任何人做过什么值得他们感谢的事。"

The words were met with another laugh, irritating Shinji. "That's where you're wrong Shinji, you only feel you have done nothing because you don't know _what_ you've done."  
这番话引来另一阵笑声，让真嗣感到恼火。“你错了，真嗣，你觉得自己什么都没做，只是因为你不知道自己做了什么。”

"And what is it I have done?"  
"那我究竟做了什么呢？"

"Saved the world Shinji, that's what you've done. You were never told the reason for the Angel attacks were you."  
"拯救了世界，真嗣，这就是你所做的。你从未被告知使徒攻击的原因，对吧？"

"You said they were genetically enhanced soldiers or something, an experiment or something like that."  
"你说过他们是基因增强的士兵之类的，某种实验或者类似的东西。"

"Correct." Spender nodded. "The reason they were attacking Tokyo 3 is because of what is, or should I say was, hidden there." Spender paused for a moment before continuing, "Look, we should continue this conversation in a more appropriate location and manner. Somehow, I doubt you really want to discuss this wearing nothing and lying in a bed. My daughter will help you get dressed and ready and will bring you down to the kitchen. We'll discuss more there."  
"没错。" Spender 点头道。"他们攻击第三新东京市的原因是因为那里隐藏着什么，或者说曾经隐藏着什么。" Spender 停顿了一下，然后继续说，"看，我们应该在一个更合适的地方和方式继续这个对话。我不认为你真的想光着身子躺在床上讨论这个。我的女儿会帮你穿好衣服并准备好，然后带你到厨房。我们会在那里继续讨论。"

Shinji turned red slightly, "Its fine I don't need…"  
真嗣的脸微微泛红，“没事，我不需要……”

He attempted to move again when pain shot through his entire body, Spender did not laugh this time, instead he walked over to the bed, placing a hand on Shinji's shoulder.  
他试图再次移动，却感到全身剧痛袭来，斯宾塞这次没有笑，而是走到床边，把手放在真嗣的肩膀上。

"I'm afraid you do, you've been gone a long time. It'll still take a bit more time for your body to wake up fully. For now my daughter has offered to help you with anything you need, please let her, she's been waiting a long time to see you wake up."  
“恐怕你确实需要，你已经离开很久了。你的身体还需要一些时间才能完全苏醒。现在我女儿愿意帮你处理任何需要的事，请让她帮忙，她已经等了很久想看到你醒来。”

Shinji nodded, still feeling the effects from his previous attempt to move. He attempted to sit up again and shift his body around just as Spender exited the room and Rebecca came back in. She immediately rushed over to him, stopping him from falling off the bed and making sure the covers didn't fall from him.  
真嗣点点头，仍能感受到之前尝试移动带来的影响。他再次试图坐起来并调整身体位置，就在这时斯宾德离开了房间，丽贝卡回来了。她立刻冲向他，阻止他跌下床，并确保被子没有从他身上滑落。

"Stay right there, don't move."  
“就待在那儿，别动。”

Shinji turned to her, "Look I'm fine."  
真嗣转向她，“看，我没事。”

She took a needle from a tray under the monitoring machine and filled it with liquid from a small vial. Shinji felt a slight sting as she injected it into his arm, followed by a slight numbness in the immediate area.  
她从监测机器下的托盘中取出一根针，从小瓶中抽取了液体。真嗣感到手臂被轻轻刺了一下，随后注射部位传来一阵轻微的麻木感。

"This should help you regain some of the feeling in your body, it might take a while to take effect so don't do anything strenuous okay, I'm here to help you if you need anything."  
“这应该能帮你恢复一些身体感觉，可能需要一段时间才能生效，所以别做剧烈运动，好吗？如果你需要什么，我在这里帮你。”

"He said I've been gone a long time, what did he mean?"  
“他说我离开很久了，这是什么意思？”

"Sorry, that was his way of saying you've been in a coma."  
"抱歉，那是他表达你已经昏迷的方式。"

"How long for? What's the date?"  
"多久了？今天几号？"

She sat down next to him, putting her arm around him and helping him to button up his shirt, "You've been out for five years, it's the twenty third of September, two thousand and twenty."  
她在他身边坐下，搂着他帮他扣上衬衫的扣子，“你已经昏迷五年了，今天是九月二十三日，二零二零年。”

_15th July 2015 2015 年 7 月 15 日_

**NERV Offices – Katsuragi's Office – 0930 hours  
NERV 总部 – 葛城办公室 – 上午 0930**

Asuka sat staring directly at Misato, not really taking in a word her director of operations was saying. Around her she was vaguely aware of the other people in the room nodding, asking questions and talking amongst each other. None of it registering at all with Asuka, all she wanted to do was get out of the office and continue searching for Shinji, that was all that had mattered to her over the past week.  
明日香直直地盯着美里，几乎没听进去她的作战部长说的任何一个字。她隐约感觉到房间里其他人的点头、提问和相互交谈。这些对明日香来说都毫无意义，她只想离开办公室，继续寻找真嗣，这是过去一周里她唯一关心的事。

"Agent Sohryu are you even listening?"  
"草薙特工，你到底有没有在听？"

She looked up straight into the eyes of Misato who was glaring at her, around her she felt the stares of the other people, Kaji, Ayanami, Hikari, Ritsuko, even the stooges were there. Asuka merely snapped back at her.  
她抬头直视着美里那双瞪着她的眼睛，周围她能感觉到其他人的目光，加持、绫波、光、律子，甚至连那些跟班也在。明日香只是不耐烦地回敬道。

"Yes I am, we search this area for him, right? I got it. Now can we stop wasting time here and just get on with it. I doubt we're even going to find him there anyway, we've already looked."  
"是的，我明白，我们要在这片区域搜寻他，对吧？我懂了。现在我们能不能别再浪费时间，直接开始行动。我怀疑我们根本在那儿找不到他，我们已经搜过了。"

"Be that as it may, we now have the Magi with us thanks to Dr Akagi. Regardless of how you feel about this he's out there somewhere, along with our suspect and both need to be found."  
"尽管如此，多亏了赤城博士，我们现在有了贤者。不管你对这件事有什么看法，他和我们的嫌疑人都在某个地方，两人都需要被找到。"

Asuka frowned, trying her damndest to show she didn't care, she had even tried to tell herself she didn't care. She told herself she was stupid for crying after Misato slapped her, for worrying about him despite the fact that she _knew_ he deserved it for being an idiot and gallivanting off on his own. Yet every night she had been back to the mansion looking for him, trying to find some sign of him trying to find the thing that took him.  
明日香皱起眉头，竭尽全力表现出她不在乎的样子，她甚至试图告诉自己她真的不在乎。她告诉自己，被美里扇了一巴掌后哭泣是愚蠢的，尽管她知道他因为是个白痴并且独自一人四处游荡而活该，但她还是担心他。然而，每晚她都回到庄园寻找他，试图找到他寻找那个带走他的东西的迹象。

"Yeah, whatever." "是啊，随便吧。"

She slumped back into her seat, noticing all around her were looking at her in disdain. Hell, even Ayanami seemed to be glaring death at her. Misato ignored the redhead though, and continued speaking.  
她颓然坐回座位，注意到周围的人都对她投以鄙夷的目光。见鬼，就连绫波也似乎在狠狠地瞪着她。美里无视了那位红发少女，继续说道。

"Ayanami, you and Sohryu are to search the area around Shinji's old apartment, ask around if anyone has seen him. Also I want you to pay Leliel's first victim a visit, see if he can tell us anything else."  
“绫波，你和惣流去搜查真嗣旧公寓周边，打听一下是否有人见过他。另外，我要你去拜访一下 Leliel 的第一个受害者，看看他能否提供更多信息。”

"Kensuke, Touji, try to find anything you can on that guy Spender, or on Leliel."  
“健介，透治，设法查查那个叫斯宾德的家伙，或者关于 Leliel 的任何线索。”

Both of them nodded and spoke in tune, "Yes Ma'am."  
两人齐齐点头，异口同声地应道：“是的，女士。”

"The rest of us will go back to the mansion and go over it again."  
“我们其他人会回到庄园，再仔细检查一遍。”

Everyone in the office got up and began to leave, with the notable exception of Asuka who remained seated. She waited until everyone had left before standing and going over to Misato's desk.  
办公室里的每个人都起身开始离开，除了仍然坐着的明日香。她等到所有人都离开后，才站起来走向美里小姐的桌子。

"You know you won't find him there so why are you searching again?"  
"你知道在那里找不到他的，为什么还要再找呢？"

Misato snapped back, "We might have missed something, we can't give up."  
美里厉声回道：“我们可能漏掉了什么，我们不能放弃。”

"You've been there every day this week, don't you think you would be better off looking elsewhere?"  
"这周你每天都去那里，你不觉得换个地方找会更好吗？"

"Like where, Sohryu? You and Ayanami are going to his old apartment today, besides that there's no where else, there's not even a hint at where he could have gone."  
"像去哪儿，惣流？你和绫波今天要去他以前的公寓，除此之外没有别的地方了，连他可能去哪儿的线索都没有。"

Asuka stopped for a moment, she could think of one place, the craft had hovered overhead. She still hadn't spoken about it with anyone, how could she? It went against everything she believed, it shouldn't have been possible. Sighing, she replied as calmly as she could.  
明日香停顿了一下，她能想到一个地方，那个飞行器曾在头顶盘旋。她至今还没和任何人提起过，她怎么可能说出口？这违背了她所相信的一切，本不该有可能。叹了口气，她尽可能平静地回答。

"Fine, go ahead and waste your time."  
"好吧，随你便，浪费你的时间吧。"

"You worked with him for nearly half a year, don't you even want to find him?"  
"你和他共事了近半年，难道你不想找到他吗？"

"Of course I want to find him, so I can tell him how much of an idiot he is for fucking up my case." She spat, something in the back of her mind simultaneously stinging in a sensitive place.  
""当然我想找到他，这样我就可以告诉他，他搞砸我的案子有多愚蠢。"" 她愤愤地说道，内心深处某个敏感的地方同时隐隐作痛。

"Is that what this is about? Because he ruined your case?"  
"这就是问题的关键吗？因为他毁了你的案子？"

"Yes, I'm the one who started the investigation, I'm the one who had been tracking the guy for a week, while trying to find out whatever I could. I didn't want to tell Shinji until I was sure it was an angel, and then when I do tell him he decides to act the hero and do this. So yes Misato I do want to find him, I want him to return just so I can tell him how much of a fucking idiot he is!"  
“是的，是我发起的调查，是我跟踪那家伙一周，试图查明一切。我不想在确定是使徒之前告诉真嗣，结果我一告诉他，他就决定逞英雄去做这件事。所以没错，美里，我想找到他，我想让他回来，这样我就可以告诉他他有多么愚蠢！”

She didn't realize she'd been screaming until a ringing silence closed back in.  
直到四周重新陷入一阵响亮的寂静，她才意识到自己一直在尖叫。

Misato stopped herself from slapping Asuka again when she thought about what she had just said, despite the egotistical nature of it Asuka did have a point and a reason to be angry.  
美里阻止了自己再次扇明日香耳光的冲动，尽管明日香的话带有自负的性质，但她确实有道理，有理由生气。

"I guess, that's something at least."  
"我想，至少还有点什么。"

**Directors Office – 1130 hours  
导演办公室 – 11 点 30 分**

Gendo sat from behind his desk in his usual manner. It had been an unusual week for him, not too long after the meeting with SEELE and the announcement of new additions for the project one of his Agents, his own son, had gone missing. A key part of his own scenario as well, he noted mentally as he looked up at the door to his office. Silently almost, it opened allowing both Kaji and Ritsuko to enter. Gendo stood up and adjusted his suit jacket slightly and began to speak.  
碇源堂一如既往地坐在办公桌后。对他来说，这是不寻常的一周，与 SEELE 会面并宣布项目新成员不久后，他的一名特工，也是他自己的儿子，失踪了。作为他自己计划的关键部分，他在心里暗自记下，同时抬头看向办公室的门。几乎无声地，门打开了，加持和律子走了进来。碇源堂站起身，稍微调整了一下西装外套，开始说话。

"We don't have much time, what is happening?"  
"我们时间不多，发生了什么？"

Ritsuko stepped forward, "As you already know, Agent Katsuragi called both me and Agent Kaji in today to help with the search for Agent Ikari, your son."  
律子向前一步，"正如您所知，Katsuragi 特工今天召集了我和 Kaji 特工来协助搜寻您的儿子，Ikari 特工。"

"I am aware of this, what else do we know?"  
"这一点我知道，还有其他什么信息吗？"

"So far we have questioned both of Shinji's friends who were monitoring him at the time he disappeared, there were no other witnesses. Agent Sohryu has also given a statement regarding what has happened. Her statement however does not correlate with that given by Shinji's friends."  
"到目前为止，我们已经询问了当时监视真嗣的两名朋友，没有其他目击者。葛城美里特工也就发生的事情提供了证词。然而，她的证词与真嗣朋友的证词并不一致。"

"In what way?" "以什么方式？"

"Both of them said that, at the time Shinji went missing, all electronics in the immediate area ceased functioning. The last image recorded on the screen was that of an old grey haired man and what we assume to be Leliel."  
"他们俩都说，在真嗣失踪的时候，附近所有的电子设备都停止了工作。屏幕上最后记录的图像是以为灰白头发的老人，以及我们推测是雷里尔的形象。"

"Do we have an identity for the man?"  
"我们有那个老人的身份信息吗？"

"No, only a partial description was given, grey hair, about mid fifties early sixties smoking a cigarette."  
"不，只给出了部分描述，灰发，大约五十五到六十岁之间，抽着烟。"

Both Gendo and Fuyutsuki looked at each other, Fuyutsuki shook his head and spoke.  
源度和冬月互相对视，冬月摇了摇头，开口说道。

"Keel…" The elder of the two men growled.  
""基尔……"" 两人中较年长的那位低吼道。

Gendo cut him off, "We cannot be certain of this just yet, if Keel does hold Evangelion Unit One however, we must recover him quickly or if necessary, terminate him."  
源堂打断了他，“我们目前还不能完全确定这一点，但如果基尔确实掌握了初号机，我们必须迅速找回他，如有必要，终止他的行动。”

The statement drew heated glances from Kaji, Ritsuko and Fuyutsuki, Gendo maintained his composure and expression and looked straight on, unfazed by Kaji's outburst.  
这番话引起了加持、律子和冬月的强烈目光，源堂保持镇定和表情，直视前方，对加持的爆发毫不动摇。

"But he's your son Gendo, he's…god damnit how can you just do that to him?"  
“但他可是你的儿子，源堂，他是……该死的，你怎么能这样对他？”

"I am aware of _who_ he is Agent Kaji, but my orders still stand. We cannot afford to take any risks, _especially_ if Keel does have him. A replacement will be prepared, those are my final words on the subject."  
"我知道他是谁，凯吉特工，但我的命令依然有效。我们不能冒任何风险，尤其是如果基尔真的抓到了他的话。我们会准备一个替代者，这是我对此事的最终决定。"

Kaji muttered, "Yes, Sir."  
凯吉低声应道：“是，长官。”

"What else do we know?"  
"我们还知道些什么？"

Ritsuko gathered herself together and continued, shaking slightly, "Agent Sohryu was unable to see the screen but, from what she said, the description does match that of a man they were contact with recently calling himself Spender. Where the reports get mixed up however is after that, both of Shinji's friends reported that the entire area went pitch black and some sort of alien craft, their words not mine, flew over them. They believe it took Agent Ikari. Asuka however claims she did not see any such thing."  
律子深吸一口气，继续说道，声音微微颤抖，“惣流探员无法看到屏幕，但根据她的描述，这与他们最近接触过自称斯宾德尔的男子相符。然而，报告在之后变得混乱，真嗣的两个朋友都提到整个区域突然陷入黑暗，某种外星飞船——这是他们的话，不是我的——从他们上方飞过。他们认为它带走了碇探员。但明日香声称她没有看到任何此类事物。”

Gendo raised his eyebrows slightly, "Any reason to believe any of them are lying?"  
源渡微微挑眉，“有什么理由相信他们中有谁在撒谎吗？”

"Sohryu has claimed in the past she does not believe in extraterrestrial life and has often criticized Ikari's belief. There was an incident between them after the last Angel."  
“惣流过去曾声称她不相信外星生命的存在，并经常批评真嗣的信仰。在上一个使徒事件后，他们之间发生过一次争执。”

"What sort of incident?" "什么样的意外？"

"I'm unsure, all I know is that Sohryu fled the scene directly afterwards, that is why she has not had the second dosage of the Evangelion serum."  
"我不确定，我只知道苏里尤直接逃离了现场，这就是为什么她没有得到第二次使徒血清注射的原因。"

"I see, that will be all. You may both leave."  
"我明白了，就这样。你们可以离开了。"

The two of them nodded and left the room, Gendo turned to Fuyutsuki, speaking quietly.  
两人点头后离开了房间，源堂转向冬月，低声说道。

"It would seem that Keel is acting of his own accord. I cannot see the rest of SEELE agreeing to something like this."  
“看来基尔似乎是自行其是。我看不出 SEELE 的其他成员会同意这样的事情。”

"Agreed, but what would he want with Shinji, and why would he have recruited Leliel? I thought Keel was committed to killing the angels, not aligning with them?"  
“同意，但他要真嗣做什么，又为何会招募雷里尔？我以为基尔是致力于消灭使徒，而不是与他们结盟？”

"I'm not sure, we need to get Unit One back though, that's our main priority, what do we know about Leliel?"  
"我不确定，但我们必须找回一号单元，那是我们的首要任务，我们对雷利尔了解多少？"

"Not much, he was one of GEHIRNS closely guarded secrets, he has claimed one victim so far. I can question Sohryu on the victim if you wish?"  
"不多，他是 GEHIRN 严密保守的秘密之一，到目前为止他已经宣称了一个受害者。如果你愿意，我可以向苏里尤询问关于受害者的情况？"

"No, that won't be necessary. Tell Rei however to keep a close watch on Sohryu."  
"不，那没有必要。不过告诉丽告诉丽，让她密切监视苏里尤。"

"Yes Sir." “是的，先生。”

_23rd September 2020 2020 年 9 月 23 日_

**Spender Mansion Gardens – 1030 hours  
斯宾塞庄园花园 —— 上午 10 点 30 分**

Five years. A whole five years had passed since that day in the mansion and he had been comatose for the entirety. The thought of it nearly made Shinji throw back up the breakfast he had just eaten. He looked at his pale reflection in the window. He sure didn't seem to have aged much or indeed look too different for that matter. There were a few cuts on his face from where Rebecca had accidentally cut whilst shaving him, something she had profusely apologized for, but aside from that he was the same person from that same day.  
五年了。自从那日在宅邸中昏迷，整整五年已逝，他一直处于昏迷状态。这个念头几乎让真嗣将刚吃的早餐吐出来。他望向窗中苍白的倒影。显然，他并未显老，或者说外表并无太大变化。脸上几处划痕是丽贝卡在为他刮胡子时不小心留下的，她为此连连道歉，但除此之外，他与那天并无二致。

He wasn't really sure what to think, he didn't know anything about where he was or what had happened to anyone. Asuka, Misato, Ayanami, his father, did they all know he was comatose, were they sat waiting for the day he would wake up? Were any of them even still alive? Rebecca hadn't told him anything, saying she would leave the explanation to her father. Instead she chose to thank him, thank him for an act he didn't even know he had performed.  
他实在不知该如何思考，对身处何地或任何人的遭遇一无所知。明日香、美里、绫波、他的父亲，他们是否都知道他昏迷不醒，是否都在等待他醒来的那一天？他们中是否还有人活着？丽贝卡未曾透露半点信息，只说她会让父亲来解释一切。相反，她选择感谢他，感谢一个他自己都不记得的举动。

He looked out across the garden, the mansion was huge, the gardens even more so. He wondered just how Spender was able to afford something like this. Maybe it had something to do with the people he worked for or maybe there was something else. He didn't have to wait long for any answers as he spotted Spender coming towards him.  
他眺望着花园，那座宅邸宏伟无比，花园更是辽阔。他不禁好奇斯宾德是如何负担得起这样的地方的。或许这与他的雇主有关，又或许另有隐情。他无需等待太久便看到了斯宾德向他走来，答案即将揭晓。

"Ikari, I see you made it, how are you feeling?"  
“碇，看来你到了，感觉如何？”

"I'm alright, muscles are still a little tight but I'm feeling much better than I was an hour ago."  
“我还好，肌肉还有些紧绷，但比一小时前好多了。”

"That's good to hear, look come with me, there's something I need to explain."  
"那太好了，跟我来，我有件事需要解释。"

Shinji began to follow the old man as they started to walk around the gardens. Spender began to explain the situation.  
真嗣开始跟随老人在花园中漫步。斯宾塞开始解释情况。

"I'm guessing Rebecca has already informed you of the date?"  
"我猜丽贝卡已经告诉你日期了吧？"

Shinji nodded, "Twenty third of September two thousand and twenty, right?"  
真嗣点点头，“二零二零年九月二十三日，对吧？”

"That's correct, has she also told you that you're not in Japan anymore?"  
“没错，她还告诉你这里已经不是日本了吗？”

Shaking his head he replied, "No she hasn't, so where are we then?"  
他摇摇头回答，“不，她没说，那我们现在在哪儿？”

"England, the north east to be precise, not in one of those smoggy industrial towns, we're in an isolated area of the country side. You see, five years ago on that day I brought you here to protect you Shinji."  
"英格兰，确切地说是东北部，不是那些烟雾缭绕的工业城镇，我们身处乡村的一个偏僻地区。你看，五年前的那天，我带你来这里是为了保护你，真嗣。"

"Protect me?" "保护我？"

"That's correct, do you remember being injected with something around the time of the Sachiel case?"  
"没错，你还记得萨基尔事件发生时被注射了什么吗？"

Shinji tried to remember, he remembered the case but not being injected with anything. "I don't think so, I remember being attacked and waking up at a medical facility some time later. Asuka was injected with something I think they said it was a vaccine for something in the forest area where we encountered Sachiel."  
真嗣试图回忆，他记得那个案件，但不记得被注射过任何东西。“我不这么认为，我只记得被袭击，然后过了一段时间在医疗机构醒来。明日香被注射了什么，他们说是森林地区我们遇到萨基尔时的一种疫苗。”

"A vaccine? Shinji regretfully, and probably not for the first time today I'm saying this, but you were lied to. That was not a vaccine that was injected into you and Sohryu. That was a serum developed in secret by GEHIRN, by a team of scientists known as part of Project E."  
“疫苗？真嗣遗憾地说，今天可能不是第一次说这话了，但你们被骗了。那不是疫苗，你和惣流被注射的是 GEHIRN 秘密开发的一种血清，由一个被称为 E 计划团队的科学家们研发的。”

Shinji stopped walking and turned to him, "Project E?"  
真嗣停下脚步，转向他，“E 计划？”

"Yes, I expect you have heard the word Evangelion throughout your cases, especially when dealing with the Angels?"  
"是的，我想你在处理与使徒相关的案件时，一定听说过‘福音战士’这个词吧？"

"Yes, one of them referred to me as an Evangelion."  
"是的，其中一位曾称我为福音战士。"

"They were correct, what you were injected with was a modification on the same serum the Angels themselves were injected with. As you may have guessed the Angels are genetically altered humans, each one the result of a different experiment on certain strands of DNA."  
"他们说得没错，你被注射的是一种基于使徒自身所注射血清的改良品。正如你可能猜到的那样，使徒是经过基因改造的人类，每一个都是对特定 DNA 序列进行不同实验的结果。"

"Certain DNA?" “特定 DNA？”

"Alien DNA to be precise. GEHIRN's goal was to create a new breed of human based on an alien race discovered in the early fifties. They were backed by very powerful people and soon a syndicate was created, managing to sneak themselves into the Japanese Government."  
“准确来说是外星 DNA。GEHIRN 的目标是基于五十年代初发现的一个外星种族，创造一种新型人类。他们得到了一些极具权势的人物的支持，并很快组建了一个辛迪加，成功渗透进了日本政府。”

Shinji didn't say anything, it was so much for him to take in. Instead he merely nodded, allowing Spender to continue speaking.  
真嗣没有说话，这一切对他来说太过震撼。他只是默默点头，让斯宾德继续说下去。

"Unfortunately there was a flaw, the two alien bodies they harvested the DNA from weren't dead. They named them Adam and Lillith and attempted to put them into stasis, afraid that the aliens would contact the rest of their race. Over the years until the early nineties progress was made on the Angel project, until there was an incident.  
不幸的是，存在一个缺陷，他们从中提取 DNA 的两具外星人尸体并未死亡。他们将它们命名为亚当和莉莉丝，并试图将它们置于休眠状态，担心外星人会联系它们的种族。直到九十年代初，天使计划取得了进展，直到发生了一起事件。

You see the GEHIRN made a mistake when they created the Angels, the mutations and alterations were perfect, it was the subjects, they chose criminals, people on death row, people no one would miss, Murderers, Rapists, general scum. They couldn't control the Angels, so what did they do? They cast them out in stasis, aware that they would wake up one day but it was for the good of mankind. So they restarted the project with a new team of scientists under the lead of one man."  
你看，GEHIRN 在创造天使时犯了一个错误，突变和改造完美无缺，但问题是实验对象，他们选择了罪犯、死刑犯、无人会想念的人，谋杀犯、强奸犯，总之是社会的渣滓。他们无法控制天使，那么他们做了什么？他们将天使置于休眠状态，明知它们终有一天会醒来，但这是为了人类的利益。于是他们重新启动了项目，由一位领导人带领的新团队接手。

Shinji didn't even need to wait for Spender to tell him the name, he knew straight away. "My father…"  
真嗣甚至不需要斯宾德告诉他名字，他立刻就知道了。“我的父亲……”

"Correct, Gendo Ikari, or Rokubungi as he was then. He was a brilliant man, intelligent, ambitious and very good at getting what he wanted. It also helped that he was engaged to the project's head scientist, your mother, Yui Ikari."  
"没错，碇源堂，那时他还叫六分仪。他是个才华横溢的人，聪明、有野心，而且非常擅长得到他想要的东西。此外，他还与项目的首席科学家，也就是你的母亲，碇唯订婚，这也大有帮助。"

"My mother was a part of this as well?"  
"我的母亲也参与了这件事？"

"She was the head scientist on the project, this time they had two goals. They needed to not only stop the Angels they had just cast out but they also wanted to create what they called a super race."  
"她是项目的首席科学家，这次他们有两个目标。他们不仅需要阻止刚刚驱逐的天使，还想要创造他们所谓的超级种族。"

Shinji felt a chill run down his spine, his mother had been involved as well. His father he would have expected but he had always been told how nice of a person his mother was, yet she had been involved in something like this too.  
真嗣感到脊背一阵发凉，他的母亲也牵涉其中。父亲的话他还能预料到，但他一直被告知母亲是个多么善良的人，然而她竟然也卷入了这种事情。

"Who else was on the team?"  
“还有谁是团队成员？”

"An older scientist, the mother of someone you met recently, Doctor Naoko Akagi and the third member of the team was another young scientist a close friend of your mothers, Doctor Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu."  
“一位资深科学家，你最近见过她女儿，赤木直子博士；第三位成员是另一位年轻科学家，你母亲的好友，惣流·齐柏林·明日香·兰格雷博士。”

Shinji looked back in surprise, that was a name he did not expect to hear. "Sohryu, Asuka's mother? I thought Asuka was German?"  
真嗣惊讶地回头，这个名字他没想到会听到。“惣流，明日香的母亲？我以为明日香是德国人？”

"She is, she was born in Germany but lived in Japan for the first four years of her life up until her mother died. Then she went back to Germany to stay with relatives and for a short period. Agent Kaji in particular, who I believe you know."  
“她的确是，她出生在德国，但在日本生活了前四年，直到她母亲去世。之后她回到德国与亲戚同住，并短暂地与加持先生，我相信你认识的那位。”

"Her mother died?" “她母亲去世了？”

"Yes, when she was young. I do not know the circumstances surrounding it but I do know it was around the same time your own mother died."  
"是的，她年轻的时候。我不清楚具体的情况，但我知道那大约是在你母亲去世的同一时期。"

"My mother was taken, she was…"  
"我的母亲是被带走的，她……"

"Abducted? Yes there were many who believed that was so, there were many that believed she was murdered by Ge…well its best not to mention that. This is about the truth and not silly rumours."  
"被绑架了？是的，很多人这么认为，也有很多人相信她是被……呃，最好还是别提那个了。我们关注的是真相，而不是无稽之谈。"

Shinji looked at him suspiciously, was he about to say his mother was murdered by Gendo, it couldn't have been. Surely not even his father was capable of that. Shinji decided to let it pass and ask his next question.  
真嗣怀疑地看着他，难道他要说是源堂杀了他母亲？这不可能。他父亲再怎么也不至于做出那种事。真嗣决定先不追究，继续问下一个问题。

"So what did the Angels want?"  
“那么，使徒们想要什么？”

"They knew about the plans to create this super race, they knew about Adam and Lillith. They returned fifteen years after the impact incident, another accident at GEHIRN, this time involving Adam. Their plan was to return to Adam or Lillith and try to summon the alien race who left them on this planet."  
“他们知道创造这个超级种族的计划，他们知道亚当和莉莉丝的存在。他们在第二次冲击事件，即 GEHIRN 发生的另一次涉及亚当的事故后十五年归来。他们的计划是回到亚当或莉莉丝身边，试图召唤那些将他们遗留在这个星球的外星种族。”

"And then what?" “然后呢？”

"First of all to destroy those that abandoned them and then bargain with the aliens to control humanity."  
"首先摧毁那些背弃他们的人，然后与外星人谈判以控制人类。"

"C…Control humanity?" "控…控制人类？"

"Yes, you see GEHIRN wanted to use the power of the angels to create a new breed of human to advance humanity if you will. The angels wanted to hand us over to the aliens, the angels were criminals. They were driven by greed, by power, what else was to be expected."  
"是的，你看，GEHIRN 想要利用天使的力量创造一种新的人类，以推动人类的进步。天使们想把我们交给外星人，他们是罪犯。他们被贪婪和权力所驱使，还能期待什么呢。"

"So we were injected to stop the Angels from reaching Adam?"  
"所以我们被注射是为了阻止天使们接近亚当？"

"Correct." "没错。"

"But, what about the Angels after Leliel, you said I saved the world, yet there were more after Leliel."  
"但是，莱利尔之后的天使们呢？你说过我拯救了世界，但莱利尔之后还有更多。"

"That's right, however Leliel was not a criminal like most of the others, he returned to me and our organization with a plan. To end it once and for all, he would help us take out the angels and stop the serum from spreading."  
"没错，然而莱利尔并不像其他大多数天使那样是罪犯，他回到我和我们的组织，并带来了一个计划。为了一劳永逸地结束这一切，他将帮助我们消灭天使并阻止血清的扩散。"

A realization hit Shinji suddenly, "That's why you lured me to that place?"  
"一个念头突然击中了真嗣，“这就是你引我到那里的原因吗？””

"That's right, the injection we gave you was to nullify the serum. Your body however had an adverse reaction to it and put you in a coma. NERV was looking for you, the rest of the Angels would appear soon so we had to get you out of there. I brought you here and my daughter looked after you while you were comatose."  
"“没错，我们给你注射的药物是为了中和血清。但你的身体对它产生了不良反应，导致你陷入昏迷。NERV 在找你，其他使徒很快就会出现，所以我们必须把你带离那里。我把你带到这里，我女儿在你昏迷期间照顾你。””

Shinji nodded, it was a lot to take in and most of it was beginning to make sense. There was still one thing on his mind though. "I see, but what about the others. Sohryu was injected as was Ayanami."  
"真嗣点点头，这一切信息量很大，大部分也开始变得合理。但他心中还有一个疑问。“我明白了，但其他人呢？惣流也被注射了，还有绫波。””

"After you vanished NERV searched for you repeatedly. There were two teams, one lead by Katsuragi and the other lead by Sohryu. After a month it was declared that you were missing and the search was called off. Sohryu however didn't give up and continued looking and digging into it, the remaining Angels attacked and were taken out, unfortunately Agent Ayanami was killed in the process."  
"在你消失后，NERV 多次搜寻你的下落。有两支队伍，一支由葛城美里领导，另一支由惣流领导。一个月后，你被宣告失踪，搜寻行动被叫停。然而，惣流并未放弃，继续寻找并深入调查，剩余的使徒发动了攻击并被消灭，不幸的是，绫波零特工在此过程中牺牲。"

Shinji lowered his head. "I see…"  
真嗣低下头。"我明白了…"

"Shortly after, the remaining angels were defeated. A year after you had gone missing. GEHIRN's plan was made public thanks to Sohryu and Katsuragi's investigation. The world was now aware of what had happened and although you were no where to be seen you were hailed as a hero. Director of NERV, Gendo Ikari was found and sentenced to life imprisonment for his actions and was replaced by Sohryu."  
"不久之后，剩余的使徒被击败。在你失踪一年后，得益于惣流和葛城美里的调查，GEHIRN 的计划被公之于众。世界现在知道了所发生的一切，尽管你杳无音讯，但你被尊为英雄。NERV 的指挥官，碇源堂被发现并因他的行为被判处终身监禁，由惣流接替他的职位。"

"She's the director of NERV?"  
“她是 NERV 的指挥官？”

"She is now yes, Katsuragi retired after the whole fiasco and serves as an advisor from what I hear."  
“现在是的，葛城美里在那场混乱后退休了，据我所知，她现在是担任顾问。”

"I see…" "我明白了…"

Shinji raised his head and looked out across the sky. In the distance he could see dark rain clouds forming, yet behind him the blue sky stretched on endlessly. A chill ran through him again as he thought about all he had just been told. The mystery of the Angels solved, Asuka becoming director, his father being sentenced for orchestrating it all. It was all too good to be true. Yet there he was. So much had happened while he had been out of it, it was all too much to take in. He felt something heavy on his back, almost as if someone was pressing down on him, a wave of nausea swept through him as he felt his eyes growing heavy. Without saying anything else he slumped to the floor passing out.  
真嗣抬起头，望向天空。远处，他能看到乌云正在聚集，然而在他身后，蓝天却无边无际地延伸着。再次袭来的寒意让他回想起刚刚得知的一切。天使之谜已解，明日香成为指挥官，父亲因策划这一切而被判刑。这一切美好得令人难以置信。然而，他就身处其中。在他昏迷期间发生了太多事情，这一切都太过沉重，难以消化。他感到背部有重压，仿佛有人正压在他身上，一阵恶心感涌上心头，眼皮也变得沉重。他没有再说什么，瘫倒在地，昏了过去。

_15th July 2015 2015 年 7 月 15 日_

**Shinji Ikaris Residence – 1045 hours  
碇真嗣的住所 – 上午 10 点 45 分**

Asuka pulled the car over to the side of the road and looked out across the building site, it had been months since the building had been burnt down and they were only just rebuilding now. Looking around she looked for any signs of life from the yard, no one was there they had all probably packed up and gave up due to the heavy rain. She turned and looked at Ayanami, who had been stone silent for the entire journey, the same expression on her face all the time.  
明日香将车停在路边，眺望着建筑工地。自从大楼被烧毁已经过去了几个月，他们现在才开始重建。她环顾四周，寻找院子里是否有生命的迹象，但那里空无一人，可能是因为大雨，大家都已经收拾东西放弃了。她转头看向绫波，后者在整个旅途中一直沉默不语，脸上始终保持着同样的表情。

Asuka spoke, her voice smacking of sarcasm. "Ok we're here, time to commence wasting our time."  
明日香开口了，语气中满是讽刺。“好了，我们到了，该开始浪费时间了。”

"Why do you believe this to be a waste of time Sohryu?"  
“你为什么认为这是浪费时间，惣流？”

"Well look at it, it's nothing more then a building site now. Shinji was taken from a mansion on the outskirts of town. He hasn't lived here for over two months and had no plans to return. What are we going to find here?"  
“看看这里，现在不过是个建筑工地罢了。真嗣是从城郊的一座豪宅被带走的。他已经两个多月没住在这里了，也没有计划回来。我们能在这里找到什么？”

"So you believe searching is a waste of time?"  
"所以你认为搜寻是浪费时间？"

"Searching here yes, it's not like they're going to let the idiot out for a walk anyway."  
"在这里搜寻是的，他们反正不会让那个傻瓜出来散步的。"

"I do not understand why you refer to him as an idiot all the time, should you not be more sympathetic towards him as you work with him."  
"我不明白你为什么总是称他为傻瓜，作为同事，你难道不应该对他更同情一些吗？"

Asuka looked at her and laughed, "Sympathetic? He brought this on himself, if he hadn't let his ego get in the way and try to take over my case this wouldn't have happened."  
明日香看着她，笑道：“同情？这都是他自找的，如果不是他让自尊心作祟，试图插手我的案子，这一切就不会发生。”

Rei glared at her, she tried to control her anger towards the red headed agent. She couldn't understand Asuka, if anything it seemed so hypocritical of her to be talking about ego's getting in the way.  
绫波瞪着她，努力控制对这位红发特工的怒火。她无法理解明日香，如果有什么的话，明日香谈论自尊心碍事显得格外虚伪。

"Is the fact that this is disrupting your case the only thing you care about?"  
“难道你只关心这会扰乱你的案子吗？”

Asuka was nearly out of the car when she heard Ayanami's words, a cocky smile adorned her lips as she replied casually, "Not the only thing I care about, but like I've been saying the idiot got himself into this situation."  
明日香几乎要走出车门时，听到了绫波的话，她嘴角挂着得意的笑容，随意地回答：“不是我唯一关心的，但就像我一直说的，那个白痴是自己陷入这种境地的。”

"If you had told him about the case in the first place would he not have gone off on his own?"  
“如果你一开始就告诉他案件的情况，他还会自己跑掉吗？”

That hit her hard, the words were like a proverbial punch to Asuka's stomach, it was exactly what she had been thinking for the past week. She had been trying to tell herself she wasn't to blame and Rei had just reminded her of that. Without turning to face Rei she shouted back.  
这话重重地击中了她，言语如同一句俗话中的拳头打在明日香的肚子上，这正是她过去一周一直在思考的。她一直在试图告诉自己这不是她的错，而绫波只是提醒了她这一点。她没有转身面对绫波，而是大声回应。

"Don't try to shift the blame onto me, let's just get this over with."  
"别想把责任推给我，我们赶紧把这事解决了吧。"

Asuka didn't give Rei a chance to reply instead stormed off around the back of the building thankful for once that it was raining, thankful that no one could tell the difference between the tears falling down her cheeks and the droplets of rain.  
明日香没给绫波回答的机会，而是气冲冲地绕到建筑后面，庆幸此刻正在下雨，庆幸没人能分辨出她脸颊上滑落的是泪水还是雨滴。

### Chapter 18 Kobayashi Maru

_30th September 2020 2020 年 9 月 30 日_

**Spender Mansion – 1115 hours  
斯宾塞庄园 – 11 点 15 分**

"A mistake, a dreadful mistake" were the only words Shinji could use to describe it. He immediately brought his hand up to his forehead, shaking his head in embarrassment. If only he hadn't hit it with that much power, and aimed the shot a little more to the left maybe then he wouldn't have the tough task of digging the ball out of the sand. From behind him he heard Spender laughing at him.  
"一个错误，可怕的错误"，这是真嗣唯一能用来形容的词。他立刻将手举到额头上，尴尬地摇着头。如果他没有用那么大的力气击球，也许稍微向左瞄准一点，那么他就不会面临从沙坑里挖球的艰巨任务了。在他身后，他听到斯宾塞在嘲笑他。

"And there I was, thinking NERV Agents were all born to play golf."  
"我本以为 NERV 特工都是天生打高尔夫的料。"

Shinji shook his head and walked over to where the ball had landed, "Most are, I never really took to the game though."  
真嗣摇了摇头，走向球落下的地方，"大多数人是，但我从来没真正喜欢过这项运动。"

"Any particular reason?" "有什么特别的原因吗？"

Shinji paused for a moment lining the shot up, "You should already know, I wasn't really one for friends throughout my time at NERV. Asuka was the first time I worked with someone long term and I don't really think golf was on her priority list."  
真嗣停顿了一下，调整击球姿势，“你应该已经知道了，我在 NERV 期间并不怎么交朋友。和明日香长期合作是第一次，而且我不认为高尔夫会在她的优先事项列表上。”

"Oh I don't know, I hear from people I know that Soryhu is a pretty mean player on the green."  
"哦，我不确定，我听认识的人说，惣流在绿茵场上可是个相当厉害的选手。"

"Really, Well isn't that something?"  
“真的，哎呀，这可真是件新鲜事？”

He swung the club, not really paying much attention to the ball, merely topping it up out of the sand trap. Shinji wasn't really too sure if this was what he wanted, it all seemed too easy. There he was at twenty eight years of age, well thirty three due to him having spent five of those years unconscious in a bed, and already he had retired.  
他挥动球杆，并没有太在意球，只是简单地从沙坑中将球击出。真嗣并不十分确定这是否是他想要的，这一切似乎都太过轻松。他才二十八岁，实际上已经三十三岁了，因为他有五年时间是在床上昏迷不醒的，而他已经退休了。

The fact was, he couldn't work. As soon as the name Shinji Ikari appeared on an application people would know he was alive. Spender had told him that for every fan Shinji had acquired since he saved the world, he had also acquired an equal amount of enemies. People who wanted the angels to succeed and if given the chance would finish what they started.  
事实是，他无法工作。一旦真嗣·碇这个名字出现在申请表上，人们就会知道他还活着。斯宾塞告诉他，自从他拯救了世界以来，他获得的每一个粉丝，也同时招来了同样数量的敌人。那些希望使徒成功的人，如果有机会，他们会完成他们开始的事情。

Then there was the other factor, NERV. Shinji hadn't asked about his status within NERV now and what would happen if they learnt he was alive. He knew Misato and Asuka were still alive. Were they still looking for him? Did they know about him being here, or had they long forgotten who he was?  
还有一个因素是 NERV。真嗣没有询问自己在 NERV 的现状，以及如果他们发现他还活着会发生什么。他知道美里和明日香还活着。她们还在找他吗？她们知道他在这里吗，还是早已忘记了他？

He hadn't spoken any further to Spender about the entire thing beyond the conversation they'd had last week. Even then it hadn't exactly been a long conversation. Immediately afterwards, Spender had shown him around the house and the village nearby. He had been introduced to the old man's family before being given a private room of his own to stay in. Spender had even told Shinji he was welcome to stay however long he felt like.  
关于整件事，他再也没有和斯宾德进一步交谈，除了上周的那次对话。即便那次也谈不上是长时间的交流。之后，斯宾德立刻带他参观了房子和附近的村庄。他先是被介绍给老人的家人，然后被安排到一个单独的房间居住。斯宾德甚至告诉真嗣，他可以随意住多久。

But still, there was that sense of doubt hanging over him. He'd been told the truth he'd sought for so long yet still, something wasn't right. It was almost too convenient. Something inside him bore at his conscience, demanding to ask more questions, to probe further, maybe even returning to Japan and seeing Misato again. Yet at the same time he couldn't bring himself to mention anything, frightened that if he did say a word he might somehow break the illusion of happiness he had while being here.  
但依然，那种疑虑感笼罩着他。他被告知了追寻已久的真相，然而，总有什么地方不对劲。这一切似乎太过巧合。内心深处有什么在啃噬他的良知，要求他提出更多问题，深入探究，甚至可能重返日本再见美里一面。然而与此同时，他又无法让自己提及任何事情，害怕一旦开口，他在这里所拥有的幸福幻象就会瞬间破灭。

"Earth to Shinji?" Spender derailed his train of thought.  
“Shinji，回神啦？”斯宾塞打断了他的思绪。

Shinji jumped slightly, "Huh?"  
Shinji 微微一惊，“啊？”

"You seem preoccupied by something."  
"你似乎在为什么事心烦。"

"Sorry I was just…thinking."  
"抱歉，我只是……在思考。"

"You were thinking about them weren't you?" The elderly man questioned.  
"你在想他们，对吧？" 老人问道。"

Shinji nodded, "I was just thinking, do they even know I'm alive or do have they..."  
真嗣点点头，“我只是在想，他们是否知道我还活着，还是已经……”

"Forgotten about you?" Spender fished "No Shinji, they haven't forgotten, although the search teams for you were called off the year you went missing, they haven't forgotten. Soryhu still has people listening out for any sign of you, and I'm told Katsuragi has been spotted several times, sniffing on the trail of even the remotest possible lead."  
“把你忘了？”斯宾塞试探道，“不，真嗣，他们没有忘记你。虽然在你失踪那年搜索队就被撤回了，但他们从未忘记。惣流仍然派人留意你的任何蛛丝马迹，我听说葛城也多次现身，追寻哪怕是最微小的线索。”

The words were somewhat of a relief to the man, "So they haven't given up?"  
这些话对真嗣来说是一种慰藉，“所以他们并没有放弃？”

"Not as far as I know, at least that's what my information tells me."  
“据我所知不是这样，至少我的信息是这么告诉我的。”

Spender began walking back to the small golf kart they had gotten for themselves, as Shinji quietly picked the ball out of the hole. As he looked up he felt a presence behind him, he turned around and his eyes widened at the sight.  
斯宾塞开始走回他们为自己准备的小型高尔夫球车，而真嗣静静地从洞里捡起球。当他抬头时，他感觉到身后有个人影，转过身去，眼前的景象让他瞪大了眼睛。

'This isn't… how did she…'  
“这不是……她是怎么……”

He blinked and the figure was gone, but the image of her was still burnt into his mind. A second ago staring back at him was the one person he hadn't expected to see, the person Spender had told him had died. Her name left his lips as he continued staring on at the patch of worn grass where the pale, blue haired woman had been standing.  
他眨了眨眼，那身影便消失了，但她形象仍深深刻在他的脑海中。就在片刻前，回望着他的是那个他未曾预料会见到的人，斯宾塞告诉他已经死去的那个人。他继续凝视着那片磨损的草地，她的名字从他唇间逸出，那里曾站着一位苍白、蓝发的女子。

"Ayanami?" "绫波？"

_17th July 2015 2015 年 7 月 17 日_

**Bar – 2300 hours 酒吧 – 晚上 11 点**

Misato stared into the half empty glass, her reflection staring back at her, distorted by the clear liquid at the bottom. She contemplated it for a moment and in one swift movement, downed the rest of the contents. She set the glass down on the table and placed her head heavily on her hand, not really looking at anything in particular. She didn't even notice Kaji walking across and sitting on the other side of the table.  
美里凝视着半空的玻璃杯，自己的倒影在其中扭曲，被杯底清澈的液体所映照。她沉思片刻，随即一饮而尽，将杯子放回桌上，头重重地靠在手上，并没有特别注视任何东西。她甚至没注意到加持正穿过房间，坐在桌子对面。

"Katsuragi, what a surprise seeing you here."  
“葛城，在这里见到你真是意外。”

There was no humor in his words, only a slight hint of worry. He placed his own drink down and handed another one to Misato.  
他的话语中没有幽默，只有一丝担忧的痕迹。他放下自己的饮料，又递给美里一瓶。

"I asked the barman what you were drinking and got you one," he forced a smile ."Not that you really need it."  
"我问了酒保你喝什么，给你点了一杯，"他勉强笑了笑，"不过你其实并不真的需要。"

She turned, finally noticing him and spoke, sounding dejected, "Oh it's you."  
她转过身，终于注意到他，声音沮丧地说："哦，是你。"

"Glad you noticed." Kaji grinned  
"很高兴你注意到了。"卡吉咧嘴笑道

"Shut up Kaji." Katsuragi grumbled.  
"闭嘴，加持。" 葛城抱怨道。

"You still blame me, don't you?"  
"你还在怪我，对吧？"

Misato glanced at him before taking a sip of her drink and then speaking again, "You're the one who had us call off the search. He's only been missing for a week. If we had been given more time we would have found him."  
美里瞥了他一眼，喝了一口饮料，然后继续说道，"是你让我们停止搜索的。他才失踪了一个星期。如果我们有更多时间，我们早就找到他了。"

"That hasn't stopped you from looking though has it?"  
"那可没阻止你继续看，对吧？"

Misato snapped back at him, trying not to shout, "Of course it has, I'm stuck in the office doing paperwork all the time now, I can't do anything."  
美里立刻反驳他，尽量不提高声音，“当然有，我现在整天被困在办公室处理文书工作，什么都做不了。”

Kaji replied casually with a sly grin, "Really, then what was Soryhu doing at the scene again today?"  
加持随意地回答，带着一丝狡黠的笑容，“真的吗？那为什么今天索吕又在现场出现了？”

Misato blinked. 美里眨了眨眼。

"She…she was at the scene?"  
“她……她在现场？”

Kaji was left more than a little surprised at Misato not knowing about this, if anything he'd expected Misato would have told Asuka and Ayanami to search again.  
对于美里对此一无所知，加持感到相当惊讶，他本以为美里会让明日香和绫波再去搜查一遍。

"You mean you didn't send her?" the agent questioned  
"你是说你没派她去？" 特工质疑道

"Of course not. If I was going to look, I'd do it myself. Why would she even be there anyway? She thinks he deserved it."  
"当然没有。如果我要调查，我会亲自去。她为什么会在那里？她认为他罪有应得。"

"Sometimes, people say things but they can mean something else entirely..."  
"有时候，人们说的话可能完全有别的意思..."

Misato spoke from behind her glass, "And just what is that supposed to mean?"  
美里从她的玻璃杯后说道，“那这又是什么意思？”

"Nothing, it just seems a bit strange you know, Soryhu calling him an idiot and saying he deserved it, yet she seems to be the most determined to find him."  
“没什么，只是觉得有点奇怪，你知道的，嗣郎称他为白痴还说他是自找的，但她似乎是最坚决要找到他的。”

"Determined? And you just think I've been doing nothing then?"  
“坚决？那你是不是觉得我就什么都没做？”

"No I didn't mean that, I know you've been trying to find him."  
“不，我不是那个意思，我知道你一直在努力找他。”

Misato cut him off unaware that she was now shouting, "Good, just because that bitch decides to go there one more time doesn't mean she's more determined than anyone else."  
美里打断了他，没意识到自己已经在喊了，“好啊，就因为那婊子决定再去一次，并不意味着她比其他人更坚决。”

Kaji quickly moved to defend himself, whilst gesturing to Misato keep her voice down. "I didn't mean it like that, sorry."  
加持迅速为自己辩护，同时示意美里降低音量。“我不是那个意思，抱歉。”

"It's just…It's just…" Misato paused for a moment before breaking down into tears, all the emotion from the past week having finally got to her, "I don't know what to do…"  
"只是……只是……" 美里顿了一下，随即崩溃地哭了起来，过去一周的所有情绪终于压垮了她，"我不知道该怎么办……"

She felt Kaji slip his arm around her, pulling her body tightly towards his own. She responded by putting her arms around him, burying her face sobbing into his jacket. She didn't care that everyone else in the bar was looking at them, or that she was holding onto the person she told herself she hated, there was something about the warmth of another body that made her feel better. She wiped her eyes with her shirt sleeve and spoke through the sobbing.  
她感觉到加持将手臂环绕在她身上，将她紧紧拉向自己。她回应着抱住他，将脸埋在他的夹克里哭泣。她不在乎酒吧里的其他人都在看他们，也不在乎她正抱着那个她告诉自己恨的人，另一具身体的温暖让她感觉好些了。她用衬衫袖子擦了擦眼睛，哽咽着说话。

"It's my fault." she mumbled, trying to catch her breath.  
"是我的错。"她咕哝着，试图喘口气。

"Don't say such a stupid thing."  
"别说这种蠢话。"

"It's true though," Misato continued, "If he thought people believed him, in what he was doing, he might not have tried to do it alone. I should have been there for him, I should have helped him but I just said nothing like a coward."  
"可这是事实，"美里继续说道，"如果他认为人们相信他，相信他所做的一切，他或许就不会试图独自承担。我本该在他身边，本该帮助他，但我却像懦夫一样什么也没说。"

Kaji grabbed hold of both her shoulders and shook her slightly, "Misato, that's not true and you know it."  
加持抓住她的双肩，轻轻摇晃她，"美里，这不是真的，你知道的。"

She ignored him and just continued speaking,  
她无视他，只是继续说道，

"I wanted to help, I wanted to tell him that I believed the same things he did, but I couldn't, I wanted him to help me find out what happened to my father as well."  
“我想帮忙，我想告诉他我也相信他所相信的，但我做不到，我也希望他能帮我查明我父亲发生了什么事。”

"Misato, what are you talking about?"  
“美里，你在说什么呢？”

"My father wasn't killed in Tokyo ," she said, looking up at Kaji with tear shimmering eyes. "I saw the lights over the city and I saw the huge ships, it was a mass abduction, like people said, like Shinji'd always believed."  
“我父亲并不是在东京被杀的，”她抬起头，泪光闪烁地看着加持，“我看到了城市上空的灯光和那些巨大的飞船，这是一场大规模的绑架，就像人们所说的，就像真嗣一直相信的那样。”

Kaji bowed his head slightly and pulled her up to her feet, whispering softly into her ear, "I think you've had enough, I'm walking you home."  
加持微微低头，将她扶起，轻声在她耳边说：“我想你已经喝够了，我送你回家。”

Kaji put his arm around her and slowly began to guide her out of the bar, the alcohol showing its effect on her step. They walked out of the bar and got a short while down the street before Misato quickly released herself from his grasp and ran into the nearly alley, her hand clamped over her mouth. Kaji made his way over to her and held her hair back and commenting sarcastically.  
加持搂着她，缓缓地带着她走出酒吧，酒精的作用在她步履中显露无疑。他们走出酒吧，沿着街道走了一小段路，美里突然挣脱他的怀抱，冲进几乎无人的小巷，一手捂住嘴巴。加持跟了过去，帮她撩起头发，带着些许讽刺地说道。

"Drinking until you throw up, very adult of you there Misato."  
"喝到吐，真是个成熟的大人啊，美里。"

She stopped vomiting and spoke back quietly, "Shut up."  
她停止了呕吐，轻声回敬道："闭嘴。"

Weakly she stood up, wobbling on jelly legs for a moment before she fell back into his waiting arm. Kaji placed his arm on her shoulder and guided her out of the alleyway.  
她虚弱地站起身，摇摇晃晃地像果冻般的双腿支撑了一会儿，随后便倒进了他张开的双臂中。加持将手臂搭在她的肩上，扶着她走出了小巷。

"I'm sorry for being an…for making you…For you...having…I don't know."  
"对不起，我成了……让你……为了你……不得不……我不知道。"

"Well whatever you're sorry for I accept."  
"好吧，无论你为何道歉，我都接受。"

"Kaji…what are they called?"  
"Kaji……它们叫什么来着？"

"What are who called?" “谁被称作什么？”

She responded, "The aliens."  
她回答道：“外星人。”

"'They' don't have a name," he answered. "'They' are just known as 'them'"  
“‘他们’没有名字，”他答道，“‘他们’只是被称为‘他们’。”

"What do 'them' want?" "‘他们’想要什么？"

"I don't know, that's what I intend to find out." Kaji said.  
"我不知道，这就是我打算弄清楚的。" 加持说。

"How?" Misato questioned.  
"怎么弄清楚？" 美里问道。

"You should be able to figure it out."  
"你应该能自己想明白的。"

"I…will?" "我……会吗？"

"I'll tell you when you're sober, you're in no condition for this type of thing."  
"等你清醒了我再告诉你，你现在不适合谈这个。"

"I'm perfectly fine look."  
"我看起来完全没事。"

Misato released herself from him and took a few steps forward, she staggered a bit and was just about to walk directly into a lamppost when Kaji stopped her.  
美里从他身边挣脱，向前走了几步，踉跄了一下，差点直接撞上灯柱，被加持及时拦住。

"Look we're nearly at your flat, I'll get you home and into bed."  
"看，我们快到你家了，我会送你回家，让你上床休息。"

"Bed sounds good…sleeping is fun."  
“床听起来不错……睡觉很有趣。”

Kaji groaned slightly as she threw herself into his arms and closed her eyes. His fears were confirmed when he heard a snore coming from the woman. A sense of guilt washed over him as he began to take her home.  
当她扑进他怀里并闭上眼睛时，加持微微呻吟了一声。当听到女人的鼾声时，他的担忧得到了证实。一种愧疚感涌上心头，他开始带她回家。

'Sorry Misato but I couldn't let you drink yourself to death in there. You'll thank me for it later, I'll explain everything tomorrow'  
“抱歉，美里，但我不能让你在那里喝到死。你以后会感谢我的，明天我会解释一切。”

_18th July 2015 2015 年 7 月 18 日_

**Hospital – 1212 hours 医院 – 12 时 12 分**

Asuka breathed slowly and deeply as she put her hand on the door. The last time she had visited him didn't exactly end the way she wanted to. The image of the hanging doll was still firmly imprinted on her mind just as the doll had been when they saw Israefel. She kept on telling herself that it was just a stupid drawing or a stupid kid's toy and it shouldn't affect her, there was nothing it could do.  
明日香缓缓深呼吸，将手放在门上。上次来看他，结局并不如她所愿。那个悬挂的玩偶形象依旧深深烙印在她脑海中，就像他们看到伊斯拉斐尔时那玩偶的样子。她不断告诉自己，那不过是一幅愚蠢的画或一个愚蠢的儿童玩具，不应该影响她，它什么也做不了。

Before opening the door she quickly told herself 'Come on Asuka don't be so stupid, it's not like he knows about mot. .'  
在开门之前，她迅速对自己说：‘加油，明日香，别这么傻，他又不知道关于摩托的事……’

"Agent Soryhu?" “索吕胡探员？”

She turned around to face the person who had just spoke, the same nurse from when she and Shinji had first came down here. Asuka nodded and replied, "Hi, how is Ushiyama doing?"  
她转过身来面对刚才说话的人，正是她和真嗣第一次来这里时的那位护士。明日香点点头回答道：“嗨，石山怎么样了？”

The nurse shook her head, "Not good I'm afraid, he refuses to see his children, claiming they aren't real. Instead he just sits there talking to drawings, saying they're his kids."  
护士摇了摇头，“恐怕不太好，他拒绝见自己的孩子，声称他们不是真的。相反，他只是坐在那里对着画说话，说那是他的孩子们。”

The words ripped through Asuka, she felt her stomach begin to turn, "I see."  
这些话撕裂了明日香的心，她感到胃里一阵翻腾，“我明白了。”

"He keeps on asking for Agent Ikari though, he says that he wants Ikari to know the truth before he returns."  
“不过他一直要求见碇探员，他说希望在回去之前让碇知道真相。”

"Returns?" Asuka's eyes lit up, "Return where?" she demanded, the nurse taken aback momentarily.  
"回去？" 明日香的眼中闪过一丝光芒，"回哪里？" 她追问，让护士一时语塞。

"I don't know," she answered. "We're moving him to a psychiatric hospital soon It's sad but he keeps on getting worse with each day."  
"我不知道，" 她回答道，"我们很快就要把他转到精神病院了。虽然很悲哀，但他每天都在恶化。"

"It'll be for the best, especially if he can't recognize his own children."  
"这样对他最好，尤其是如果他连自己的孩子都认不出来的话。"

Asuka felt a stinging sensation behind her eyes. She turned her head and blinked it away, that was something she didn't need. She opened the door to the room slightly, wishing she had never come here in the first place...  
明日香感到眼后一阵刺痛。她转过头，眨了眨眼，试图驱散这种感觉，这是她不需要的。她轻轻推开房门，心中暗自希望自己从未踏足此地...

'Why am I doing this?' she asked herself, 'Just to get Shinji back?'  
'我为什么要这么做？'她自问，'只是为了找回真嗣吗？'

Slowly she stepped into the room. Ushiyama was sat upright, staring out of the window across at the Tokyo 3 skyline. Scattered around him were multiple copies of the same two drawings, each of two different children. Asuka tried not to look at them as she walked across to his bedside. As Ushiyama turned to look at her she spoke, her voice betraying her barely restrained anger.  
她缓缓步入房间。Ushiyama 笔直地坐着，凝视着窗外东京 3 的天际线。他周围散落着多份相同的两个孩子的画作，每份都描绘着两个不同的孩子。明日香尽量不去看那些画，径直走向他的床边。当 Ushiyama 转头看向她时，她开口了，声音中透露出她极力压抑的愤怒。

"You know where he is, don't you?"  
"你知道他在哪儿，对吧？"

"He has found his reality." the man answered as if it was the most obvious thing.  
""他已经找到了他的现实。"" 那人回答，仿佛这是最显而易见的事情。

Again with the reality bullshit. Asuka sighed as he turned to look back outside the window. This was worse than dealing with drug addicts, at least they didn't remind you of your childhood.  
又是这种现实的无稽之谈。Asuka 叹了口气，转身再次望向窗外。这比对付吸毒者还糟糕，至少他们不会让你想起童年。

"What do you mean he has found his reality, where did Leliel take him?"  
"你说的他找到了自己的现实是什么意思？Leliel 把他带到哪儿去了？"

He laughed, "Leliel take him? Leliel doesn't take them, Keel takes them. He invites you in and then they take you to show you your reality."  
他笑道，"Leliel 带他走？Leliel 不带他们走，是基尔带他们走。他邀请你进去，然后他们带你去看你的现实。"

Asuka thought about his words, Keel invites them in. Shinji didn't know anyone called Keel, nor did Asuka to the best of her knowledge. She stood there thinking for a few moments more then it hit her, Shinji had been given Leliel's location by Spender. She was unaware of the words leaving her mouth.  
明日香琢磨着他的话，基尔邀请他们进去。真嗣不认识叫基尔的人，据明日香所知，她也不认识。她站在那里又想了一会儿，突然间恍然大悟，真嗣是从斯宾德那里得知 Leliel 的位置的。她没意识到自己的话已经脱口而出。

"Spender… " She paused for a moment before speaking more frantically, "What did they do to you?"  
"斯宾塞…" 她停顿片刻，语气更加急切地问道，"他们对你做了什么？"

"They have shown me the truth," he answered with an insane joy. "It was paradise Soryhu, a true paradise, but as soon as I had gotten used to it they cast me back out into this world. It's so unfair don't you think?"  
"他们向我展示了真相，" 他用一种疯狂的喜悦回答，"那是索里胡，真正的天堂，但当我刚适应它时，他们就把我扔回了这个世界。这不公平，你不觉得吗？"

Asuka just continued questioning him, "What was this paradise like?"  
明日香继续追问，"那个天堂是什么样的？"

"It was like my dreams, just like Ikari's is."  
"这就像我的梦，就像碇的梦一样。"

A theory began to develop in Asuka's mind. If she hadn't been so desperate to find Shinji she would have dismissed it as pure idiocy yet now, it seemed to make sense when put with what she had just been told. She quickly made her way out of the room and took her cell phone out looking through the list of numbers, eventually she scrolled down to the one she wanted.  
一个理论开始在明日香的心中形成。如果不是她如此迫切地想要找到真嗣，她本会将其视为纯粹的愚蠢，但现在，结合她刚刚得知的信息，这似乎说得通了。她迅速离开房间，拿出手机，浏览着号码列表，最终她滚动到了她想要的那一个。

'Okay…I have to do this, I know they're idiots but I have to get him back, he's mine god Dammit'.  
'好吧……我必须这么做，我知道他们都是笨蛋，但我必须把他带回来，他是我的，该死的。'

She pressed the call button and put the phone to her ear waiting for the reply, after a short while a voice she immediately recognized as Kensuke's came across the other side.  
她按下通话键，将手机贴近耳边等待回复，不久便听到了一个她立刻辨认出是健介的声音从另一端传来。

"Kensuke, It's Soryhu." “健介，我是真嗣。”

His reply was swift and spoken with a hint of anger. Asuka hadn't done herself any favors with him or Touji when she'd said that Shinji'd deserved to be captured. _"Oh the red devil, what do you want?"_  
他的回应迅速且带着一丝怒意。明日香之前说真嗣活该被抓，这让她在健介和渡治那里都没讨到好。“哦，红发魔女，你想要什么？”

"I need your help with something."  
"我需要你帮忙做件事。"

She felt so dirty saying that.  
她说出这话时感到无比肮脏。

_"What could you possibly need our help with, and why would we help you anyway?"  
"你究竟有什么需要我们帮忙的，再说我们凭什么要帮你？"_

"Because I'm going to get Shinji back."  
"因为我要把真嗣带回来。"

_"You mean the person who you called an idiot and said deserved to be captured?"  
"你是说那个你曾骂作白痴、还说活该被抓的人？"_

Asuka snarled, her ego forcing her to reply harshly, "Yes that's the one, I'm going to find him and tell him how much of an idiot he is."  
明日香咆哮道，她的自尊迫使她尖锐地回应，“没错，就是他，我要找到他，然后告诉他他有多白痴。”

_"What's in it for us?"  
"这对我们有什么好处？"_

"What do you mean what's in it for you?" she snapped "Don't you want your friend back?"  
"你什么意思，对你有什么好处？"" 她厉声道，""难道你不希望你的朋友回来吗？"

_"Yes we do, but if it means working with you we want something else."  
"是的，我们确实希望，但如果这意味着要与你合作，我们想要别的东西。"_

Asuka couldn't believe it, she was trying to negotiate with two people she should really arrest anyway for illegal activity. She was tempted to use that against them when she realized that she and Shinji were involved anyway. "Look can we sort this out later? We don't have time for this."  
明日香简直不敢相信，她竟然在试图与两个本应因非法活动而逮捕的人谈判。她本想利用这一点来对付他们，但随即意识到自己和真嗣也牵扯其中。“听着，我们能不能晚点再解决这个问题？我们没时间了。”

_"Fine but just because it's Shinji, don't expect any other help from us."  
“好吧，但只是因为他是真嗣，别指望我们再提供其他帮助。”_

"Fine with me, I'll be sure to tell the idiot how useful you guys were as well."  
“我无所谓，我会确保告诉那个白痴你们有多么‘有用’。”

_"What do you want then?"  
"那你想要什么？"_

"Are you and Touji knowledgeable about psionics?"  
"你和东治对念动力了解吗？"

_"Psionics, yes but what does this have to do with Shinji?"  
"念动力，是的，但这和真嗣有什么关系？"_

"What do you know about telepaths?"  
"你对心灵感应者了解多少？"

**Director's Office – 1330 hours  
局长办公室 – 13:30**

"Is this what you've been able to find?"  
"这就是你找到的全部吗？"

Gendo was stood behind his of his desk. Fuyutsuki, Ritsuko and Kaji stood around the desk looking inwards. Gendo looked at the documents before him, various overhead images of the coastal area, about thirty miles outside of the city. On each photo Ritsuko had circled areas and made a small note next to them.  
源渡站在他的办公桌后。冬月、律子和加持围站在桌旁，目光向内。源渡看着面前的文件，各种海岸地区的航拍图像，大约在城市外三十英里的地方。每张照片上，律子都圈出了一些区域，并在旁边做了小注释。

Ritsuko nodded "Yes, I was able to set the Magi off running an analysis on what we know. We were also able to use data we em…'borrowed' from the rest of SEELE and the committee to confirm our analysis. We believe Leliel and Keel have him in one of the crashed pods outside of the city, each area I've circled indicates one of the pods."  
律子点头道：“是的，我启动了 MAGI 进行分析，根据我们所知的信息。我们还利用了从 SEELE 和其他委员会‘借来’的数据来确认我们的分析。我们认为 Leliel 和 Keel 把他藏在了城市外坠毁的其中一个驾驶舱里，我圈出的每个区域都指示着一个驾驶舱。”

Gendo frowned. It was the first bit of emotion he had shown since the whole incident began. "They are not making it easy for us, it seems SEELE have one agenda while Keel has his own, using this Spender alias to try to manipulate both Eva's."  
源渡皱起眉头。这是自事件开始以来他首次流露出情感。“他们似乎并不打算让我们轻松，看来 SEELE 有一个议程，而 Keel 则有自己的计划，利用这个 Spender 的化名试图操纵两台 EVA。”

"It would seem so sir, however what would Keel's agenda be? Surely as the head of the committee, what he says goes."  
"看来确实如此，先生，但基尔的议程会是什么呢？作为委员会的负责人，他的话自然是权威。"

"Keel is an intelligent man, he might be the head of the committee but he knows he doesn't have full control over them. If the others disagree with him or want him removed they can have it done so."  
"基尔是个聪明人，他虽然是委员会的负责人，但他知道并没有完全掌控他们。如果其他人不同意他或想让他下台，他们可以做到。"

Fuyutsuki cut in at that moment, "It would seem Keel wants to do more than gain their trust now, after all I doubt kidnapping one of them is a good way to gain favors."  
此时冬月插话道：“看来基尔现在想要的不仅仅是赢得他们的信任，毕竟我怀疑绑架其中一人可不是赢得好感的好方法。”

"It's what happens after he kidnaps them that's the concern" the Commander growled "We do not have the appropriate information on Leliel to make a full judgment. Agent Kaji, you have been tracking Soryhu have you not, what do you know?"  
"问题在于他绑架他们之后会发生什么，"指挥官咆哮道，"我们没有关于雷利尔的足够信息来做出全面判断。碇カジさん，你一直在追踪索吕，不是吗？你知道些什么？""

"As predicted she disobeyed the order for the search to be called off and is now conducting her own little investigation. She visited the previous victim of Leliel's today. I do not know what was said but afterwards she headed off in the direction of Shinji's otaku friends."  
"正如预测的那样，她违抗了停止搜索的命令，现在正在进行她自己的小调查。她今天拜访了雷利尔之前的受害者。我不知道他们说了什么，但之后她朝着真嗣的御宅朋友们的方向去了。""

"Unit two is proving much more rash than we anticipated, just like her mother. However the situation calls for a little bit more than just rashness, we need to act fast. Its possible Keel has already informed Shinji about us. If that happens…"  
"二号机表现得比我们预想的还要鲁莽，就像她母亲一样。然而，这种情况需要的不仅仅是鲁莽，我们需要迅速行动。基尔可能已经通知了真嗣关于我们的事情。如果那样的话……""

Fuyutsuki finished off his sentence, "The Scenario is doomed to fail and SEELE win?"  
冬月结束了他的话，“这个计划注定失败，SEELE 会赢？”

"Correct." “没错。”

"I will make sure this information conveniently lands in Sohryu's path then." Kaji spoke out.  
“我会确保这条信息恰巧出现在惣流的路径上。”加持说道。

Both Ritsuko and Kaji left, Gendo sitting back down as Fuyutsuki took a seat nearby.  
律子和加持都离开了，源堂重新坐下，而副司令官冬月则在附近落座。

"Keel working with one of the Angels. I can't see that arrangement lasting long."  
“基尔与其中一位使徒合作。我看这种安排不会长久。”

"It only needs to last long enough for Keel to get what he wants, I intend to gain the upper hand however. If we can expose Keel to Soryhu or even to Shinji it should cause a bit of a stir in the collective, buy us a bit more time for our own preparations."  
“只要能让基尔得到他想要的，就足够了。无论如何，我打算占据上风。如果我们能让基尔接触到丽，甚至是真嗣，那应该会在使徒群体中引起一些骚动，为我们自己的准备争取更多时间。”

"Hmmm, Leliel worries me. He was a product of secret experiments during the cold war, before he became attached to the Angel Project. He is fully aware of what he is and has experience using his power, even if we can get Shinji back it's possible he won't even be the same person."  
"嗯，Leliel 让我很担心。他是冷战时期秘密实验的产物，后来才加入天使计划。他完全清楚自己的身份，并且有使用自己力量的经验，即使我们能把真嗣救回来，他也可能不再是同一个人了。"

"That is why we have the replacement dummy plug lined up, if anything should happen we will be able to load everything into the clone."  
"这就是为什么我们已经准备好了备用模拟插入栓，一旦发生什么意外，我们可以将所有数据加载到克隆体中。"

"Sound's like you've already made your mind up."  
"听起来你已经下定决心了。"

Gendo smiled from behind his folded hands and responded with a hint of arrogance in his voice, "I have, the replacement will be unnecessary. Shinji is stronger than that."  
源渡双手交叠，微笑着，语气中带着一丝傲慢地回应道：“我已经考虑过了，替换是不必要的。真嗣比那要强。”

_18th July 2015 2015 年 7 月 18 日_

**30km South of Tokyo 3 – 2330 hours  
东京 3 号市以南 30 公里 – 23 时 30 分**

Asuka stopped the car and scanned the area. She couldn't believe that all this was outside of Tokyo 3. She couldn't even remember crossing the threshold from forest into desert. As she stepped out of the car the night breeze washed over her, sending a shiver down her spine. She locked the door and withdrew her torch from its pocket, although the moon was providing a decent amount of illumination on its own.  
明日香停下车，环顾四周。她难以置信这一切竟在第三新东京市之外。她甚至记不清自己何时从森林跨入了沙漠。当她走出车外，夜风拂过，让她不禁打了个寒颤。她锁上车门，从口袋里取出电筒，尽管月光本身已提供了相当不错的照明。

She took a few steps forward and immediately felt something beneath her, whereas before it'd felt like sand now it was a much harder and sturdier surface. She knelt down and began to brush away some of the sand, uncovering a cold rounded metal surface with various markings on it. The marking that caught her eye immediately however was the one she had seen countless times before, the image of the triangle with seven eyes within it.  
她向前走了几步，立刻感觉到脚下有异，之前像是沙地，现在却变得坚硬而稳固。她跪下身，开始拂去沙尘，露出了一个冰冷的圆形金属表面，上面刻有各种标记。然而，最吸引她目光的标记是她早已见过无数次的——那个内含七只眼睛的三角形图案。

She moved along a bit more trying to get a feel of the general shape of the object beneath her, trying to find someway inside it. Shinji was in there and she knew it. A few more meters and she felt it begin to sink slightly. The sand around this piece was mostly uncovered. She knelt down and noticed two small handles revealing that it was some type of hatch.  
她又向前挪动了几步，试图感受身下物体的整体形状，寻找进入的方法。她知道真嗣就在里面。再前进几米，她感觉到它开始微微下沉。这块区域的沙子大部分都未被覆盖。她跪下来，注意到两个小把手，表明这是一个某种类型的舱口。

Slowly she began to open it and peered down, moving her torch around. She couldn't believe it. It was a corridor of some type of alien craft. There was a short ladder leading down onto the main deck below. From inside she could hear two voices, the first of which she recognized as belonging to Spender or as she now knew him to be, Keel. The second voice also belonged to a man, but she could not recognize it, she assumed it to be Leliel though.  
她慢慢地开始打开它，探头向下看，移动着手电筒。她简直不敢相信。这是一条某种外星飞船的走廊。有一架短梯通向下方的主要甲板。从里面她能听到两个声音，第一个她认出是属于斯宾德，或者现在她知道他是基尔。第二个声音也属于一个男人，但她无法辨认，她猜测可能是雷利尔。

'Just as I was told'  
'正如我所被告知的那样'

She swung herself around and down into the hatch, making sure to be as quiet as possible as she followed the ladder down. Much to her surprise the corridor was dimly lit by blue lighting attached to the ceiling. Most of the corridor was unlike anything she had seen before. The walls were a dark metallic grey, along them were various pipes dripping a liquid she knew to be LCL. A chill ran down her, for some reason it was suddenly extremely cold.  
她轻盈地转身，顺着舱口滑下，小心翼翼地沿着梯子往下爬。令她惊讶的是，走廊被天花板上附着的蓝色灯光昏暗地照亮。大部分走廊的景象她前所未见。墙壁是深灰色的金属质地，沿着墙壁排列着各种管道，滴落着她知道是 LCL 的液体。一股寒意袭来，不知为何，突然变得异常寒冷。

As she inched further up the corridor the two voices grew louder. She stopped just short of an entrance way into another room. It appeared to be some sort of laboratory, inside she could see both Keel and Leliel moving around a large lab table towards the centre. .Someone, she didn't know who, was strapped on top of it.  
随着她沿着走廊缓缓前行，那两个声音越来越清晰。她在即将进入另一个房间的入口处停了下来。那里似乎是一个实验室，她能看到基尔和雷利尔在中央的大实验桌旁忙碌。有人，她不知道是谁，被绑在桌子上。

'Shinji…is that you? What are they doing to you?'  
'真嗣……是你吗？他们对你做了什么？'

A few more moments passed as she watched, impatiently grabbing hold of her handgun. From outside Asuka watched Leliel making his way over to one of the control panels inside the laboratory. Apparently oblivious to her presence, he began typing in commands. Shortly afterwards, a loud hum began from a device directly over Shinji. She edged closer and watched as a faint blue glow appeared over the device and began to cover her colleague, Keel turned around and watched the glow, Leliel quickly typing more commands into the console. From behind him Keel questioned him angrily, "What are you doing?"  
又过了一会儿，她不耐烦地握紧了手中的手枪。在外面，Asuka 看着 Leliel 走向实验室内的一个控制面板。显然没有注意到她的存在，他开始输入命令。不久之后，一个设备直接在 Shinji 上方发出了响亮的嗡鸣声。她悄悄靠近，观察到设备上出现了一层微弱的蓝光，开始覆盖她的同事。Keel 转过身来，注视着蓝光，Leliel 则迅速在控制台上输入更多命令。在他身后，Keel 愤怒地质问他：“你在做什么？”

Leliel responded, "I knew it was a set up Keel and I know about the dampeners you're about to activate before you kill me. I accepted my fate a long time ago, but he doesn't have to. I carried out my end of the deal and you betrayed me, as my final act I'm showing him what truly awaits if he trusts a piece of shit like…"  
Leliel 回答道：“我就知道这是个圈套，Keel，我知道你们即将启动的阻尼器，在我被杀之前。我很久以前就接受了自己的命运，但他不必如此。我已经履行了我的承诺，而你背叛了我，作为我的最后行动，我要让他看看，如果他信任像……这样的垃圾，真正等待他的是什么。”

Leliel was unable to get his final word out before Keel withdrew a small handgun and shot him pointblank in the chest. Leliel slumped forward and dropped to his knees, looking up at Keel. From around the corner Asuka watched as Keel calmly withdrew a handkerchief and cleaned the splashes of blood from his gun. She resisted the urge to rush in and shoot him herself, instead patiently waiting for him to move away from Shinji.  
在莱利尔能说出最后一句话之前，基尔抽出一把小手枪，近距离朝他的胸口开了一枪。莱利尔向前一倒，跪在地上，抬头看着基尔。从角落里，明日香看着基尔平静地拿出一块手帕，擦拭着枪上的血迹。她忍住了冲进去亲自向他开枪的冲动，而是耐心地等待他离开真嗣。

'Do not confront Keel, that's what they told me.'  
“不要与基尔对峙，他们就是这么告诉我的。”

"He's all yours, Soryhu."  
“他归你了，惣流。”

Asuka looked up at Keel moving down the deck towards the ladder. Keel knew she was there yet, he hadn't done anything. Did he know that she knew about him and simply not care or was he unaware? Deciding she didn't have much time to think about is, she quickly made her way into the room only to find Leliel had gotten to his feet and was now standing over Shinji. She drew her pistol and targeted him. He turned round and looked her straight in the eyes, traces of desperation in his own. She kept her gun trained directly on him and shouted out.  
明日香抬头看着基尔沿着甲板向梯子走去。基尔知道她在那里，却什么也没做。他是知道她已经了解情况而不在乎，还是根本没意识到？她决定没时间多想，迅速进入房间，却发现雷里尔已经站了起来，正站在真嗣上方。她拔出手枪瞄准他。他转过身，直视她的眼睛，眼中流露出一丝绝望。她稳稳地用枪指着他，大声喊道。

"Move away from him." “离开他。”

Leliel didn't move, instead he dropped to one knee, LCL dripping from his wound. He spoke, his voice hoarse and desperate.  
雷里尔没有动，反而单膝跪地，LCL 从伤口滴落。他开口说话，声音沙哑而充满绝望。

"Soryhu…you need to help him get out of it, please let me help you…"  
"索里胡…你得帮他摆脱困境，请让我帮你…"

"How can you help me?"  
"你如何帮我？"

"He has to come out of this on his own, I can't break the link by force or he'll die. I can establish a weak link between you and him. There will be no risk to you, please do this."  
"他必须自己走出这困境，我不能强行切断联系，否则他会死的。我可以在你和他之间建立一个微弱的联系。这对你没有风险，请这么做。"

"Why do you want to have him out of it so badly?"  
"你为什么这么想让他脱离困境？"

"Because if he doesn't come out of this, that man Keel and SEELE they win, the rest of the Angels will come, driven by their need to acquire Adam's DNA. If one of them does so it'll be over, but if they fail, SEELE will be able to execute their own scenario. Only you and Shinji can prevent this. Please," the Angel begged, "We don't have long left, my time here is running short."  
"因为如果他不醒过来，那个叫基尔的人和 SEELE 就会得逞，其余的天使们会为了获取亚当的 DNA 而蜂拥而至。如果其中一位成功了，一切就结束了，但如果他们失败了，SEELE 就能执行他们自己的计划。只有你和真嗣能阻止这一切。请，""天使恳求道，""我们剩下的时间不多了，我在这里的时间也所剩无几。"

"What do I have to do?"  
"我该怎么做？"

"Just stand there." “就站在那儿。”

She stood over at where he was pointing and looked down at Shinji's unconscious form, every so often she saw him twitch. She grabbed hold of his hand as she heard the Angel behind her tapping at a console.  
她按照他的指示站过去，低头看着昏迷的 Shinji，时不时见他抽搐。她握住他的手，同时听到身后的使徒在操作台上敲击。

"I'm opening a link between all three of us, you will be able to see what he see's. You will for a brief moment be of one mind and then you will be separate entities but you will be inside his mind."  
“我正在打开我们三人之间的链接，你将能看到他所看到的。你们会短暂地共享一个意识，之后虽然各自独立，但你将进入他的内心世界。”

"Inside his mind?" "在他的内心中？"

"Yes, I can't explain. I have this ability to alter peoples perception of reality, you need to get him to wake up from the fake reality Keel forced me to put him into. When you do I will show you the truth."  
"是的，我无法解释。我有这种能力，可以改变人们对现实的感知，你需要让他从基尔强迫我给他制造的虚假现实中醒来。当你做到这一点时，我会向你展示真相。"

Asuka nodded at him, it sounded so ridiculous. All this talk about realities, neural links and being of one mind, how could it be possible? It shouldn't be possible. She didn't get a chance to ask anymore questions as a white light surrounded her, she felt herself being pulled through something as various images flashed through her mind. Images of her own past, images she thought she had locked away. Each one only lasting for a brief second, her as a young girl, her mother in the hospital, the doll her mother kept with her and then…the day it happened. Asuka nearly screamed out when she saw the still figure but as soon as it appeared it had vanished, instead now she was seeing images she didn't recognize, a mansion, Shinji talking to Keel. Keel telling him the year, with each word she heard from Keel, each goddamn lie she felt more angered. Angered not by the lies themselves but angered by the fact that Shinji believed each and every one of them.  
明日香对他点了点头，这听起来太荒谬了。所有这些关于现实、神经链接和心灵合一的谈话，怎么可能？这不应该可能。她没有机会再问更多问题，因为一道白光包围了她，她感觉自己被拉过某种东西，各种图像在她脑海中闪过。她自己过去的图像，那些她以为已经封存的记忆。每一个只持续了一瞬间，她还是个小女孩，她的母亲在医院，她母亲一直带着的玩偶，然后……那一天发生了。当明日香看到那个静止的身影时，她几乎尖叫出来，但那身影一出现就消失了，取而代之的是她不认识的图像，一座庄园，真嗣和基尔交谈。基尔告诉他年份，每从基尔口中听到一个字，每一个该死的谎言，她都感到更加愤怒。愤怒不是因为谎言本身，而是因为真嗣相信每一个谎言。

_30th September 2020 2020 年 9 月 30 日_

**Spender Mansion 斯宾塞庄园**

Shinji stood alone looking out across the seemingly endless countryside, behind him was Spender's mansion. The image of Rei from earlier on was still planted firmly in his mind. Was it only a hallucination or was it something more? Spender hadn't mentioned any side effects of the treatment Shinji was now receiving, then again, Shinji hadn't even asked.  
真嗣独自站立，眺望着似乎无边无际的乡村景色，身后便是斯宾塞的庄园。早些时候丽在他脑海中的影像依然挥之不去。那究竟是幻觉，还是别的什么？斯宾塞并未提及真嗣现在接受的治疗会有什么副作用，不过话说回来，真嗣也未曾询问过。

Since seeing Ayanami he had kept his distance from any of the people in the house, wanting time on his own to think about that had happened and what would happen next. He didn't want to have to stay here for the rest of his life and have to rely on them, he was grateful but at the same time he wasn't happy.  
自从见到绫波后，他便刻意与屋内的任何人保持距离，希望独自思考所发生的一切及接下来会发生什么。他不想余生都留在这里并依赖他们，他心存感激，但同时并不快乐。

He walked forward a bit when a sudden chill ran down his spine, he suddenly got the same feeling he had when he's seen Ayanami earlier that day, the feeling that someone was there watching him. Slowly he turned around. Standing ten meters from him was Asuka. She was wearing the same dark suit he last remembered her wearing, her long red hair blew in the breeze. He eyes were fixed on him almost as if they were burning a hole straight through him.  
他向前走了几步，突然一阵寒意袭来，他猛然感到与那天见到绫波时相似的感觉，仿佛有人在暗中窥视。他缓缓转身，只见十米开外站着明日香。她穿着他记忆中那套深色西装，长发随风飘扬。她的目光紧盯着他，仿佛能将他洞穿。

"You coward," she spat. "Taking the easy way out, so desperate to find the truth that when someone tells you something resembling what you want to hear away you go and believe it like a fool."  
“你这个懦夫，”她厉声道，“选择逃避，如此渴望真相以至于别人随便说点你爱听的，你就傻乎乎地信以为真。”

"Asuka…what are you doing here?" he questioned, his mind spinning in a reverie of conflicting thoughts. "They told me you were the head of NERV now."  
"Asuka…你在这里做什么？" 他问道，脑海中思绪纷乱如麻。"他们告诉我，你现在已经是 NERV 的负责人了。"

She stood completely motionless, her eyes still fixed on him. Once again she spoke with even more venom in her voice. "Well isn't that convenient Shinji. You find your truth and nothing else matters."  
她完全静止不动，目光依旧紧锁在他身上。再次开口时，她的声音中带着更深的怨恨。"那么，Shinji，这不是很方便吗？你找到了你的真相，其他的一切都不重要了。"

"Wha...What do you mean?"  
"什...什么意思？"

"You didn't want the truth, you just wanted what was convenient for you. You wanted your beliefs to be confirmed so that you could run away and hide from the rest of the world."  
"你并不想要真相，你只想要对你方便的东西。你希望你的信念得到证实，这样你就可以逃避并躲开这个世界的其他部分。"

"I didn't run away, I…didn't…" he stuttered.  
"我没有逃跑，我……没有……" 他结巴道。"

"Bullshit! You act under the pretense that you don't want to hurt anyone, but in reality it's you who doesn't want to be hurt. You don't care about anyone as long as it turns out great for you."  
"胡说八道！你打着不想伤害任何人的幌子，但实际上是你不想被伤害。只要结果对你有利，你根本不在乎任何人。"

"That's not true..." "那不是真的..."

"Of course it is. Look at when Misato first adopted you. You ran away then because you were frightened of her, then when you first started working with me and I told you about your father, you did it again, and now, well, you join up the dots idiot."  
"当然是真的。看看美里第一次收养你的时候，你因为害怕她而逃跑了，然后你第一次和我一起工作，我告诉你关于你父亲的事，你又逃了，现在，好吧，你自己把点连起来，傻瓜。"

Shinji felt the anger rising inside him, he began to shout back.  
真嗣感到怒火在心中升腾，他开始大声反驳。

"How have I run away, I didn't have any choice but to be here? They brought me here…"  
"我怎么是逃跑了，我别无选择只能来这里。是他们把我带到这里来的……"

"You had a choice Shinji, and you made up your mind."  
"你有选择的，真嗣，是你自己决定的。"

"No I didn't want to…it's not…"  
"不，我不想……这不是……"

Sudden pain shot through his body again just as it had before he awakened from the coma, Asuka began moving towards him as he dropped down to his knees. She brought a hand up to his cheek and caressed it slowly, Shinji looked her in the eyes, they were still filled with rage.  
就在他从昏迷中醒来之前，突如其来的疼痛再次贯穿了他的身体，明日香开始向他走去，他跪倒在地。她将手举到他的脸颊上，缓缓抚摸，真嗣凝视着她的眼睛，那里依旧充满了愤怒。

"You really are pathetic, you want to see the truth? This is what your truth is going to be if you don't wake up, this is the real truth."  
“你真是可悲，想看到真相吗？如果你不醒来，这就是你的真相，这才是真正的真相。”

Shinji clutched hold of his head and screamed out as more pain shot through it, he felt as if he was being torn apart inside. He continued looking up into Asuka's eyes but his vision was now becoming nothing more then a blur. He felt her taking hold of him and pulling him towards her as everything faded to darkness.  
真嗣紧抓着头，痛苦地尖叫起来，更多的疼痛穿透了他的头部，他感觉自己仿佛被撕裂开来。他继续抬头凝视着明日香的眼睛，但视线已变得模糊不清。他感觉到她抓住了他，将他拉向她，一切渐渐陷入黑暗。

Slowly he felt himself falling towards the ground, his vision began to reappear but the scene had now changed. It was no longer the vibrant green English countryside he had been in for the past week, now it was like something out of a nightmare. Beside him Asuka stood, not speaking but looking out over the cliff top they were standing on, beneath them the water crashing against the rocks, only it had turned a dark red color. In the distance Shinji could make out figures moving back and forth, huge monstrous tripods taller than anything he had seen before. They strode effortlessly through a series of ships set out across the water, as they did so they emitted a deafening howl which roared through the air like thunder.  
慢慢地，他感觉自己正向地面坠落，视野开始重新显现，但场景已然改变。不再是过去一周所处的生机勃勃的英国乡村，现在这里宛如一场噩梦。阿斯纳站在他身旁，一言不发，只是凝视着他们所站立的悬崖边缘，下方海水猛烈撞击着岩石，只是颜色已变成深红色。在远处，真嗣能辨认出一些身影来回移动，那些巨大的三脚怪物比他见过的任何东西都要高。它们轻松地穿行于水面上的一系列船只之间，每走一步，便发出震耳欲聋的嚎叫，如同雷鸣般响彻空中。

Above them was another huge road, a series of spotlights scanning the area. Shinji looked up and saw a huge craft moving over them. Asuka turned to him and began speaking.  
在他们上方，又是一条巨大的道路，一排排探照灯扫视着区域。真嗣抬头望去，看见一艘巨大的飞行器正从他们头顶掠过。阿斯纳转向他，开始说话。

"This is what will happen if you don't return, Leliel is showing us this. What Keel has shown you was a lie, an illusion based on what you thought you wanted. Please just come back, we need you…I need you."  
“如果你不回来，这就是将要发生的事，雷利尔正在向我们展示这一切。基尔向你展示的，是一个谎言，一个基于你自以为想要的东西所制造的幻象。请回来吧，我们需要你……我需要你。”

_18th July 2015 2015 年 7 月 18 日_

**Laboratory – 2345 hours 实验室 – 23 时 45 分**

Shinji's eyes shot open, he found himself staring directly into a light overhead, beside him he could vaguely make out the shapes of two people. As he began to regain his vision he turned his head slightly and noticed Asuka was kneeling beside where he was lying. Slightly behind her was the man he recognized as Leliel, he was clutching his chest and standing near a computer panel. Shinji whispered hoarsely.  
真嗣的眼睛猛地睁开，发现自己正直视着头顶的一盏灯，在他旁边，隐约可以看到两个人的轮廓。随着视力的逐渐恢复，他微微转头，注意到明日香正跪在他躺着的地方旁边。在她稍后的位置，是那个他认出是雷利尔的男人，他紧捂着胸口，站在一台电脑面板旁。真嗣嘶哑地低声说道。

"What…what is this place?"  
"这…这是什么地方？"

"This is one of their ships Shinji, you were right they do exist."  
"这是他们的一艘船，真嗣，你是对的，他们确实存在。"

"I was…right?" "我…我猜对了？"

She didn't get a chance to respond as Leliel interrupted her, "Soryhu, get him out of here, you don't have the time for this. If SEELE learn what has happened here they will send someone out, someone who cannot be stopped, even by an Evangelion."  
她还没来得及回应，Leliel 就打断了她，“总士，把他带离这里，你没时间耽搁了。如果 SEELE 得知这里发生的事，他们会派人来，一个连 EVA 也无法阻止的人。”

"You know about the Evangelion project?"  
“你知道 EVA 计划？”

"Yes, I know you two are Units One and Two respectively, please just get out of here. I will handle the rest."  
“是的，我知道你们分别是初号机和二号机的驾驶员，请尽快离开这里。剩下的我会处理。”

Asuka nodded and began to lift Shinji up off of the lab table, she put her arm around him and began to walk him out of the room back into the corridor she had came down. The next step however was getting him up the short ladder out of the craft.  
明日香点点头，开始将真嗣从实验台上扶起，她用胳膊环住他，带着他走出房间，回到她来时的走廊。然而，下一步是要让他爬上那段短梯，离开驾驶舱。

"Shinji are you alright to climb this?"  
“真嗣，你能爬这个梯子吗？”

"I'll…be alright." “我……会没事的。”

Asuka began to climb the ladder and made her way out of the hatch back onto the beach, she extended her hand down and shouted towards Shinji, her voice echoing throughout the night.  
明日香开始攀爬梯子，从舱口返回海滩，她伸出一只手，朝着真嗣大喊，声音在夜空中回荡。

"Shinji, grab my hand I'll help you up."  
“真嗣，抓住我的手，我拉你上来。”

She felt him taking hold of her hand and saw him moving slowly up the ladder, she pulled with all her strength trying to get him up and out of the hatch. As she did so she could have sworn she saw a faint orange glow around them both, but she shrugged it off as stress.  
她感觉到他握住了她的手，看着他缓慢地爬上梯子，她用尽全力试图将他拉出舱口。就在这时，她几乎可以肯定看到他们周围有一圈微弱的橙色光芒，但她将其归咎于压力产生的幻觉。

After a brief struggle he was out and she was helping him towards her waiting car. Asuka quickly put him into the back of the car, she stepped into the car and heard him speaking again.  
经过短暂的挣扎，他终于出来了，她扶着他走向她等候的车。明日香迅速将他安置在车后座，随即自己也上了车，听到他又开始说话。

"He said he was sorry."  
“他说他很抱歉。”

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

Asuka began moving the car away, just as she did so she heard a rumbling sound underneath her as the ground began to shake. She floored the accelerator and moved the car away quickly in any direction, as she did so fire tore through the sky and a deafening explosion was heard all around them. She looked around in horror and saw various pieces of the metal craft being thrown up into the air.  
明日香开始驾车离开，就在这时，她听到车下传来隆隆声，地面开始震动。她猛踩油门，迅速朝任意方向驶离，与此同时，火焰划破天空，四周响起了震耳欲聋的爆炸声。她惊恐地环顾四周，看到各种金属残骸被抛向空中。

She turned back round and kept on driving towards Tokyo 3 trying to put it out of her mind, trying to concentrate on herself and Shinji getting back safely. At the back of her mind though what she had just seen stabbed at her, the Angel, Leliel had sacrificed himself to protect them, not only that but he had told them that they were the only ones who could change what the rest of the Angels or SEELE were trying to do.  
她转过身，继续向第三东京市驶去，试图将那件事抛诸脑后，专注于自己和真嗣安全返回。然而，在她心底，刚刚所见的一幕如利刃般刺痛着她，天使雷利尔为了保护他们而牺牲了自己，不仅如此，他还告诉他们，只有他们能够改变其他天使或 SEELE 试图做的事情。

_19th July 2015 2015 年 7 月 19 日_

**Asuka's Residence – 0020 hours  
明日香的家——凌晨 00:20**

Asuka stumbled into her bedroom, her arm still wrapped around Shinji keeping him held up. She gently sat him down on the bed and pulled the covers away. She took her jacket off and looked at the blood staining her jacket, it was strange she didn't remember receiving the wound even when Leliel had linked her with Shinji she hadn't been injured then. From behind she heard Shinji muttering slightly.  
明日香踉跄地走进卧室，手臂依旧环抱着真嗣，支撑着他。她轻轻地让他坐在床上，掀开被子。她脱下夹克，看着上面沾染的血迹，奇怪的是她并不记得自己何时受了伤，即便在与雷里尔连接时与真嗣相连，那时她也没有受伤。从背后，她听到真嗣轻微的嘟囔声。

"You're…injured…" “你……受伤了……”

She snapped back at him. "Yeah I'm injured, it's nothing compared to what I've had before. Just shut up for a moment okay."  
她立刻回敬道：“是啊，我受伤了，但这跟我以前经历的比起来不算什么。你就安静一会儿，好吗？”

She took her shirt off and looked at the wound properly, it wasn't anything major. Quickly she grabbed set of bandages from her nightstand drawer and began wrapping them around the wound. As she did so she thought about what had just transpired. She had seen into Shinji's mind, she had seen parts of his innermost thoughts, she knew how he felt about her.  
她脱下衬衫，仔细查看伤口，并不严重。她迅速从床头柜抽屉里抓出一卷绷带，开始缠绕伤口。过程中，她回想起刚刚发生的一切。她窥探了真嗣的内心，看到了他内心深处的某些想法，她知道了他对她的感觉。

She had also seen that what Leliel had shown her, what he stated as the truth. Could it be true, that fighting the angels was pointless? That everything she had done up until now had been a waste of time and no matter what they did it was all going to be for nothing in the end?  
她还看到了莉莉尔展示给她的一切，以及他所说的真相。难道与天使的战斗真的毫无意义吗？她至今所做的一切难道都是徒劳，无论他们做什么，最终都只会化为泡影吗？

If the rest of the Angels came and acquired what Leliel called 'Adam's DNA' then humanity would perish, yet if they succeeded and stopped the Angels SEELE would be able to carry out their scenario and would hand humanity over to the aliens. It couldn't be true, Leliel was an angel just like the others but he had helped her. He had helped get Shinji back, why would he show her all that if it was just a big lie and then why would he sacrifice himself to save them?  
如果其他天使降临并获取了莉莉尔所说的‘亚当的 DNA’，人类将灭亡；但如果他们成功阻止了天使，SEELE 就能实施他们的计划，将人类交给外星人。这不可能是真的，莉莉尔和其他天使一样，但他帮助了她。他帮助找回真嗣，如果这一切只是个大谎言，他又为何要牺牲自己来救他们呢？

She finished wrapping them tightly and spoke out angrily. "There all better now."  
她将它们紧紧包扎好，然后生气地说道：“现在都好了。”

She turned round to look at Shinji. He was still sitting up looking at her, his eyes watery. Asuka walked over to him and knelt down before him, not caring that she was half naked or that she too was now crying. Forcing the thoughts about what she had seen out of her mind she brought a hand up to his cheek and caressed it slowly.  
她转过身来看向真嗣。他仍然坐着，泪眼汪汪地看着她。明日香走到他面前，跪了下来，毫不在意自己半裸的身体或是她也正在哭泣。她强迫自己不去想刚才看到的一切，抬起手来轻轻抚摸他的脸颊。

"Next time, I won't forgive you."  
“下次，我不会再原谅你。”

He didn't reply, instead he just blinked a tear rolling gently down his cheek. She took her hand away and laid him down on the bed, putting the covers over him. His eyes closed gently, she knelt there for a few moments before leaning in and kissing him on the cheek. She stood up slowly and went round to the other side of the bed and got in next to Shinji, she whispered good night into his ear and held onto him as she tried to get to sleep.  
他没有回答，只是眼角轻轻滑落一滴泪。她收回手，让他躺下，盖上被子。他的眼睛缓缓闭上，她跪在那里片刻，然后俯身在他脸颊上轻轻一吻。她慢慢站起身，绕到床的另一边，躺在了真嗣旁边，对着他的耳朵低语晚安，并拥着他试图入睡。

### Chapter 19 Confrontation

_19__th_ _July 2015_ 2015 年 7 月 19 日

**Asuka's Residence – 0730 hours  
明日香的家 – 早上 07:30**

Asuka's eyes opened slowly. She reached her arm out and was surprised when she felt it drop to the bed. Blinking, she sat up and found the bed was empty except for her. The side next to her was neatly made as well. She didn't understand, when she'd fallen asleep Shinji had been there. Could the whole thing, Leliel, the alien ship, the human instrumentality project have all been a dream? She looked at her arm, the injury she had sustained the night before was there still, neatly bandaged up.  
明日香缓缓睁开眼睛。她伸出手臂，却惊讶地发现手臂无力地垂落在床上。她眨了眨眼，坐起身来，发现床上除了自己空无一人。旁边的床铺也整理得一丝不苟。她不明白，入睡时碇真嗣明明还在这里。难道莱里尔、外星飞船、人类补完计划这一切都只是一场梦？她看向自己的手臂，前一晚受的伤依然在那里，整齐地包扎着。

She sighed, not quite sure how she should feel. It wasn't a dream anyway. What she had seen was indeed real but that wasn't really much of a comfort. There was also the slight matter of Shinji's location now. She wondered just how long ago it had been that he had gotten up and left.  
她叹了口气，不太确定自己应该有什么感觉。反正那不是梦。她所见的一切确实是真实的，但这并没有带来多少安慰。还有碇真嗣现在身在何处的问题。她想知道他究竟是什么时候起床离开的。

She muttered to herself angrily "Least he made his side of the bed I guess…" she trailed off and looked around. There was nothing to indicate he had even been there, not even a note, "… could have left a note though."  
她生气地自言自语道：“至少他把床铺整理好了……”她环顾四周，没有任何迹象表明他曾在这里，甚至连一张字条都没有，“……至少可以留张字条吧。”

She wasn't sure what to feel, disappointed maybe? Of course she was disappointed, she had risked her life going to somewhere she didn't know based on a hunch and something Kaji had told her to save him. She had let him share a bed with her and he had simply got up and left without making any contact.  
她不确定自己是什么感觉，或许是失望吧？当然，她是失望的，她冒着生命危险去了一个自己不熟悉的地方，仅仅凭着直觉和加持告诉她的事情去救他。她让他和她同床共枕，而他却只是起身离开，没有任何联系。

Angered definitely. For the second time in two weeks he had left without saying anything and gone on his own. There was a slight scratching at her soul telling her that maybe it was her fault, the past few weeks hadn't exactly been easy, especially since _she_ had kissed him and ran. She had performed the same act she was currently berating Shinji for doing, running away, except when she did it, it was far worse. She had done it after kissing him passionately. Not only had she run but she had slapped him and blamed him for it.  
肯定是愤怒的。在两周内，这是他第二次不告而别，独自离开。她的内心深处有种轻微的抓挠感，告诉她这可能是她的错，过去的几周并不容易，尤其是自从她吻了他然后逃跑之后。她现在正责备真嗣的行为，自己却做了同样的事——逃跑，只不过她的情况更糟。她不仅逃跑了，还在激情地吻了他之后扇了他一巴掌，并把责任推给他。

Could she really blame him for not wanting to be near her?  
她真的能怪他不想靠近她吗？

Then there was the way she had acted before Leliel. She'd gone behind his back, visiting the victim and investigating the case without even telling him. Her actions lead to his capture. If she hadn't gone behind his back he wouldn't have went after Leliel. No, surely she wasn't to blame for that. Sure she had wanted to get some credit for it, to try to satisfy her own ego by solving most, if not all of the case before anyone else got a chance to learn about it, but Shinji's actions were his own. He was a man and he had to take responsibility for his own decisions.  
然后是她面对雷利尔时的行为。她背着他去探访受害者，私自调查案件，甚至没告诉他一声。她的行动导致他被捕。如果不是她背着他行事，他就不会去追雷利尔。不，当然不能怪她。确实，她想为此获得一些认可，试图通过在其他人了解案情之前解决大部分，甚至全部问题来满足自己的虚荣心，但真嗣的行为是他自己的选择。他是个男人，必须为自己的决定负责。

Finally there was the way she had acted after his capture, the way she spoke about him to his friends, to Ayanami and to Misato. That hadn't done her illustrious reputation any favours at all, all it had earned her was a slap from Katsuragi and the previously emotionless Ayanami arguing with her and angrily leaving the accommodation Asuka had offered her. Asuka had seen some of Shinji's thoughts when Leliel had connected their minds. Had Shinji seen some of hers? Had he seen the way she'd acted?  
最后是他被捕后她的行为，她对真嗣的朋友们，对绫波和美里说话的方式。这丝毫没有为她那显赫的名声增光，反而只换来了葛城的一记耳光，以及之前冷漠的绫波与她争吵并愤怒地离开了明日香提供的住处。明日香曾在雷利尔连接他们心灵时看到过真嗣的一些想法。真嗣是否也看到了她的某些想法？他是否看到了她的所作所为？

'_No, if he'd seen that he would have seen that I was there to help him…I did do the right thing…Didn't I?"_  
'不，如果他看到了，他会明白我是去帮他的……我确实做了正确的事……不是吗？

She stood up and pulled on her dressing gown, before realizing she still had her trousers on from last night. She looked at the bed and saw the traces of sand and groaned. If there was one thing she hated it was being near sand and now she was going to be finding traces of it in her bed for weeks. She slipped the trousers off and exited the room, tying the dressing gown around her.  
她站起身，披上睡袍，随即意识到自己还穿着昨晚的裤子。她望向床铺，看到沙粒的痕迹，不禁呻吟起来。如果说有什么是她最讨厌的，那就是靠近沙子，而现在她将要几周都在床上发现沙子的踪迹。她脱下裤子，走出房间，将睡袍系好。

She began to make her way down the stairs when a familiar smell entered her nostrils. She sniffed around a bit trying to place it. Her stomach growled as it got stronger and she followed it down the stairs. The smell of fried bacon, eggs, sausage, everything you could wish for in a good breakfast. It smelled just as good if not better than the ones she had had back in Germany.  
她开始下楼，一股熟悉的香味钻入鼻孔。她四处嗅了嗅，试图辨认。随着香味愈发浓烈，她的肚子咕噜作响，便顺着香味下楼。煎培根、鸡蛋、香肠，所有你能在丰盛早餐中期待的美味。这味道即便不比她在德国吃过的更好，也至少同样诱人。

'_Least he had time to make breakfast for himself, could have offered me some though.'_  
“至少他有时间为他自己做早餐，虽然也可以分我一些。”

She frowned as she got to the foot of the stairs, not so much upset that he hadn't been in her bed when she'd woken up, but angry that he had left and used her kitchen. She entered the living room and jumped when there was a clatter from inside the kitchen. She heard a voice inside, cursing as she looked on in surprise.  
她皱着眉头走到楼梯脚下，倒不是因为他没在她醒来时躺在床上而难过，而是因为他离开了并用了她的厨房。她走进客厅，突然厨房里传来一阵叮当声，吓了她一跳。她听到里面有个声音在咒骂，惊讶地看着。

'_Shinji?'_ ‘真嗣？’

Slowly she crept up to the door and sure enough Shinji was inside her kitchen, two plates were set out on the side. He was standing over the cooker looking over two frying pans. She smiled when she saw him, feeling relieved that he hadn't left and also that he was making her breakfast.  
她慢慢地悄悄走到门口，果然，真嗣在她的厨房里，旁边摆着两个盘子。他站在炉子前，盯着两个煎锅。看到他，她笑了，感到宽慰他没有离开，还在为她做早餐。

She stepped into the kitchen, resisting the urge to yell out as her bare feet touched the cold tiles. She stood by the work tops watching Shinji whilst simultaneously trying not to make any noise. He was stood watching everything in the pans intently. She continued sneaking up behind him up until she was right next to him, he turned and jumped slightly causing her to laugh out loudly.  
她走进厨房，忍住大喊的冲动，赤脚踩在冰冷的瓷砖上。她站在工作台旁，一边观察着真嗣，一边尽量不发出任何声音。他站在那里，专注地看着锅里的东西。她继续悄悄地走到他身后，直到她站在他旁边，他转过身来，微微一跳，让她大声笑了出来。

"Sorry, I was just seeing what you were doing."  
"抱歉，我只是想看看你在做什么。"

"Oh right." "哦，对了。"

"I thought you had already left, I woke up and you weren't there."  
"我以为你已经走了，我醒来时你不在那儿。"

Shinji shifted uncomfortably as he replied, "I woke up about an hour ago, I couldn't really sleep too well so I came down here. I thought you might like breakfast when you woke up so I thought I'd make something."  
真嗣不安地挪了挪身子，回答道：“我大约一小时前醒的，实在睡不好，就下楼来了。我想你醒来可能会想吃早餐，所以就想着做点什么。”

There was a strange tension in the room, both of them fell silent not really sure what to say to each other. None of them wanted to talk about what had happened the night before, but then, there was nothing else to say. Shinji didn't even know what had happened when he'd woken up. He could remember Asuka rescuing him and helping him to wake up. He could remember being shown that fake future Spender and Leliel had conjured up and then being shown scenes of an invasion that Leliel had said was their true destiny.  
房间里弥漫着一种奇怪的紧张气氛，两人都陷入了沉默，不知道该说些什么。他们都不想提及昨晚发生的事，但除此之外，也确实无话可说。真嗣甚至不清楚自己醒来时发生了什么。他只记得明日香救了他，帮助他苏醒。他记得被展示了斯宾德和雷利尔制造的虚假未来，然后又被展示了雷利尔所说的他们真正的命运——一场入侵。

He remembered waking up in a strange room, a laboratory, but it wasn't like anything he had seen, before being bundled into the back of a car. After that nothing, until he woke up lying next to Asuka, her arm's wrapped warmly around him, he had lay there for a few moments debating whether or not to wake her up, or to leave the house altogether. He was at the door and about to leave when he heard one word leaving her sleeping lips, one simple word that made him stop in his tracks and stay, _'Mother.'_  
他记得在一个陌生的房间里醒来，那是一个实验室，但与他之前见过的任何实验室都不同，随后就被塞进了车后座。之后便是一片空白，直到他发现自己躺在明日香身边，她的手臂温暖地环绕着他。他躺在那里，犹豫着是否要叫醒她，还是干脆离开房子。当他走到门口准备离开时，听到了她梦呓中吐出的一个词，一个简单的词让他停下了脚步，留了下来，‘妈妈’。

He watched Asuka as she went over to the table and sat down, smiling slightly.  
他看着明日香走到桌边坐下，微微一笑。

"Thanks." she said “谢谢。”她说

Shinji turned back round to the cooker and returned to watching over the food, turning over some of the items inside the pan. He continued watching for a few more moments before turning the cooker off and beginning to empty the contents of the pans onto the plates he had set out. He picked up the two plates, took them over to the table, and sat opposite Asuka. He watched her tentatively as she picked up her fork and placed a bit of bacon into her mouth.  
真嗣转回身面对炉灶，继续照看锅里的食物，不时翻动几下。他又观察了一会儿，然后关掉炉子，开始将锅里的食物盛到事先摆好的盘子里。他拿起两盘菜，走到桌前，坐在明日香对面。他小心翼翼地观察着她，只见她拿起叉子，将一片培根送入口中。

Immediately she smiled at him,  
她立刻对他露出了微笑，

"Wow I haven't tasted something this good since I was in Germany, I didn't know you could cook."  
“哇，自从在德国以来，我还没吃过这么好吃的东西，没想到你还会做饭。”

He smiled back, 他回以微笑，

"You sort of have to know how to cook when you live with Misato. It's not that she's bad, it's just you get fed up of takeaways all the time."  
“和美里住在一起，你多少得会点做饭。她倒不是做得不好，只是总吃外卖谁也受不了。”

"I see, I wouldn't have been able to put up with it."  
“原来如此，我可受不了这个。”

"It was fine, I didn't mind." Shinji waved it off. "Besides, cooking was one of the few things I enjoyed."  
"没事，我不介意。" 真嗣摆摆手。"再说了，烹饪是我为数不多的爱好之一。"

"Oh right, so what else don't I know about you?"  
"哦对了，还有哪些是我不了解你的地方？"

"Nothing really aside from the fact that I cook there isn't anything else."  
"真的没什么了，除了我会做饭这一点，其他没什么特别的。"

"There must be something else."  
"肯定还有别的什么。"

He shook his head, "No there's nothing."  
他摇了摇头，"没有，什么都没有。"

She felt herself starting to get slightly annoyed at his reluctance to say anything. She knew there must have been something else. "You really are boring aren't you, so besides cooking you have no other hobbies?"  
她感到自己开始有点恼火，因为他不愿透露任何信息。她知道肯定还有别的事情。"你真的很无趣，不是吗？除了烹饪，你就没有其他爱好了？"

"Well I…played the cello."  
"嗯，我……拉过大提琴。"

"Now we're getting somewhere, how long have you been playing?"  
"现在我们有点进展了，你拉了多久？"

"I've been playing since about the age of ten, it was passed down to me by my uncle. It was the only thing I had left of my mother's."  
"我从大约十岁开始拉，是大提琴传给了我。这是我母亲留给我的唯一东西。"

Asuka lowered her eyes slightly when he mentioned his mother, she saw immediately it was a tough subject for him. She understood in a way, she had never spoken about her own mother to him or anyone else for that matter. Intrigued by the fact that he played an instrument she carried on, "Oh right, how come you said you played it?"  
"当他说到他的母亲时，明日香微微垂下了眼帘，她立刻意识到这对他来说是个棘手的话题。她某种程度上能理解，因为她从未向他或任何人提起过自己的母亲。出于对他会演奏乐器的好奇，她继续问道：“哦，对了，你为什么说你会弹呢？””

A hint of sadness flickered in his eyes, "I don't have it anymore...when those people came to my apartment and burnt it down it destroyed everything in there, including the cello."  
"他眼中闪过一丝悲伤，“我已经没有它了……那些人闯进我的公寓，放火烧了它，里面的一切都被毁了，包括那把大提琴。””

Asuka couldn't help but feel like an idiot as an uncomfortable silence settled on the room. A minute ago they had been both fairly happy and in a good mood. Now the air of sadness and inevitability regarding what they learned last night had returned. They continued eating in silence until Asuka heard Shinji speaking again.  
明日香不禁觉得自己像个傻瓜，房间里弥漫着尴尬的沉默。就在一分钟前，他们还都很开心，心情愉快。现在，昨晚得知的悲伤和不可避免的气氛又回来了。他们默默地继续吃饭，直到明日香再次听到真嗣说话。

"It was the only thing I had left of her, that bastard took everything else. The photographs, the whole lot and then he abandoned me to live with my uncle. The only reason I got the cello was because my uncle kept hold of it when my mother left university and married my father."  
"这是她留给我的唯一东西，那个混蛋夺走了其他所有。照片，全部都拿走了，然后他抛弃了我，让我和叔叔一起生活。我能得到这把大提琴，只是因为叔叔在我母亲离开大学嫁给父亲时保留了它。"

For a moment it was almost as if Asuka could feel Shinji's anger, she looked across the table at him. He wasn't looking at her, instead he had his head down looking at the tiles she wasn't sure what to say or do. Something inside her made her want to go around the table and hold him, something else prevented her from doing so, her pride wouldn't let her drop her own emotions in front of him. She called across at him, unaware of how venomous her voice was.  
有那么一刻，仿佛明日香能感受到真嗣的愤怒，她隔着桌子看向他。他没有看她，而是低着头盯着地砖，她不确定该说什么或做什么。内心有种冲动让她想绕过桌子去拥抱他，但另一种情绪阻止了她，她的自尊不允许自己在对方面前放下自己的情感。她朝他喊道，没意识到自己的声音有多么尖锐。

"Shinji, snap out of it."  
"真嗣，振作起来。"

He looked up at her and spoke quietly, "Sorry, I didn't want to spoil the mood."  
他抬头看着她，轻声说道：“对不起，我不想破坏气氛。”

Who was he kidding, the mood was already spoiled from the moment she had encountered him in here. They were just skipping around subjects trying to avoid their true thoughts and Asuka was getting fed up with skipping around it.  
他这是在自欺欺人，从她在这里遇到他的那一刻起，气氛就已经被破坏了。他们只是在绕着话题转，试图避开真实的想法，而明日香已经厌倦了这种绕弯子。

"Shinji we need to talk about what we saw last night and what we know. We don't have to do it here we can do it at NERV."  
“真嗣，我们需要谈谈昨晚看到的事情和我们所知道的。我们不必在这里谈，可以在 NERV 谈。”

"At NERV? I don't know if I want to go back in there yet…"  
"在 NERV？我还不知道自己是否想回到那里去……"

"You're acting like you have a choice, look I went through a lot to get you back. I know you saw how I acted as well and I'm not going to apologize for it."  
"你表现得好像自己有选择似的，听着，我费了很大劲才把你找回来。我知道你也看到了我当时的举动，我不会为此道歉的。"

Shinji nodded, "I know you're not…you were right. It was my fault..."  
真嗣点点头，"我知道你不会……你说得对。那是我的错……"

"You're not making this easier for me Shinji."  
"你这不是在让我更难办吗，真嗣。"

"But…" he started ""但是……"" 他开口道

"Shut up for a moment" Asuka cut him off, "Look Shinji, they don't really look to well on me at the moment there. Katsuragi is pissed with me and Ayanami…you know a few days ago she actually left here because of what I was saying? She actually got angry and left?"  
"先闭嘴一会儿。"" 明日香打断了他，""听着，真嗣，他们现在对我的看法可不太好。葛城小姐对我很生气，还有绫波……你知道吗，前几天她居然因为我说的话离开了这里？她真的生气了，然后走了？"

There was a sly grin on her face when she said that. It was almost as if she was proud of the fact, yet at the same time incredibly embarrassed. Shinji couldn't help himself but laugh,  
她说话时脸上带着狡黠的微笑。仿佛她对此既感到自豪，又无比尴尬。这让真嗣忍不住笑出声来，

"You got Ayanami angry?" “你把绫波惹生气了？”

"Yes I did, I don't really have a lot of friends there at the moment. So that's why you're coming in today. It's a matter of pride for me Shinji. I want to show them I went and got you back, I need to prove myself to them."  
“是的，我确实惹她生气了。我现在在那儿没什么朋友。所以这就是你今天要来的原因。这对我是关乎尊严的事，真嗣。我想向他们证明，我把你带回来了，我需要向他们证明自己。”

Shinji looked down slightly dejected, the way Asuka worded it, it sounded like she was just using him for her own gain. "I see."  
真嗣略显沮丧地低下头，明日香的话听起来就像是在利用他为自己谋利。“我明白了。”

Asuka picked up on his reaction immediately, she thought about what she had just said and the image of herself standing in some hole in the desert holding a big spade popped into her mind, "That didn't really sound good did it? Look I…I want to apologize for the way I acted, it wasn't right blaming you, but there's something else at NERV."  
明日香立刻察觉到了他的反应，她回想起自己刚才说的话，脑海中浮现出自己站在沙漠中的一个洞里拿着大铲子的形象，“这么说确实不太好听，对吧？听着，我……我想为我的行为道歉，把责任推给你是不对的，但 NERV 还有其他问题。”

"What would that be?" “那会是什么呢？”

"NERV's Director…your father."  
"NERV 的指挥官……你的父亲。"

**Committee Meeting Room 委员会会议室**

Lying was an art form, an art form that two of the people in the room had mastered. Gendo Ikari and Lorenz Keel, both seemingly on the same page yet both each having their own agenda's. In between the two of them sat the rest of SEELE or the committee. A committee led by Lorenz Keel but oblivious to his own plans, oblivious to what had happened between him and Leliel.  
撒谎是一种艺术形式，房间里的两个人都精通此道。碇源堂和洛伦兹·基尔，表面上似乎步调一致，实则各自心怀鬼胎。在他们两人之间坐着 SEELE 或委员会的其他成员。这个由洛伦兹·基尔领导的委员会，却对他的计划一无所知，对发生在他和雷利尔之间的事情也毫不知情。

It wasn't really a meeting that they were sitting in it was more of a game between Gendo and Keel, a test to see who would mess up their words first, or who would mess up at all. It was almost like a game of chess, each one plotting out their next move waiting for the other to make a mistake. It was a test, the subject Shinji Ikari's encounter with the angel known as Leliel.  
这并非一场真正的会议，更像是源堂和基尔之间的游戏，一场测试，看谁会先说错话，或是谁会先出错。它几乎像是一场国际象棋比赛，每个人都策划着下一步棋，等待对方犯错。这是一场考验，主题是真嗣与名为雷里尔的天使的遭遇。

"Ikari," Keel intoned in a hacking, cancerous voice. "As you are probably aware, Leliel was terminated last night thanks to the efforts of Agents Ikari and Sohryu."  
“碇，”基尔用一种沙哑、病态的声音说道，“你可能已经知道，昨晚雷里尔被终结了，这要归功于碇和惣流特工的努力。”

Lie number one from Keel, Gendo smiled slightly from behind his folded hands and responded casually.  
基尔的第一个谎言，碇微微一笑，双手交叠在背后，随意地回应道。

"I was only made aware this morning chairman. I do not see why this meeting has been called however. As promised the Angel has been defeated, surely we should be focusing on the next one."  
"我今早才得知此事，主席。我不明白为何要召开这次会议。正如承诺的那样，‘天使’已被击败，我们理应专注于下一个目标。"

Gendo's face betrayed no emotion as he sat awaiting Keel's response. At the other end of the table, Keel too sat completely still, except for his withered lips, which were curled upwards into an arrogant smile.  
碇源堂的脸上毫无表情，他坐着等待基尔的回应。在桌子的另一端，基尔也完全静止不动，除了他那干瘪的嘴唇，微微向上卷起，露出一丝傲慢的微笑。

"Indeed, there is just the matter of the location of your Agent Ikari for the past two weeks. It would seem you had several Agents out trying to locate him in an area where Leliel was suspected of being."  
"确实，还有关于你的特工碇真嗣过去两周行踪的问题。似乎你有几名特工在怀疑有‘雷利尔’出没的区域寻找他。"

Keel was playing it dangerously, Gendo knew it, but he couldn't reveal his knowledge of what really happened. To do that would give Keel the opportunity to reveal the exact nature of the contact between Leliel and Agent Ikari. Calmly he responded smirking with his last comment and looking directly at Keel, "A temporary setback, we were able to locate Ikari. Sohryu tracked him down. It is believed he was lured out to the location by an accomplice of Leliel's."  
基尔正玩着危险的游戏，碇知道这一点，但他不能透露自己对真相的了解。这样做会让基尔有机会揭露雷利尔与碇源堂特工之间接触的确切性质。他平静地回应着，带着最后一丝冷笑，直视基尔，“暂时的挫折，我们已经找到了源堂。惣流追踪到了他。据信他是被雷利尔的同伙引诱到那个地点的。”

Check. 将军。

Keel raised his eyebrows, he quickly fired back at Gendo. "So Leliel was indeed able to capture one of your Agents, a key part of the Evangelion project?"  
基尔挑了挑眉，迅速回击碇。“这么说，雷利尔确实捕获了你们的一位特工，这是《福音战士计划》的关键部分？”

"Yes." "是的。"

"You are aware of what this could mean then, knowing full well what Leliel is capable of. Even though Leliel is gone his influence could still be within Agent Ikari."  
"你清楚这可能意味着什么，完全了解 Leliel 的能力。尽管 Leliel 已经消失，他的影响仍可能存在于碇真嗣体内。"

Gendo looked Keel dead in the eyes, "I am aware, and I will be having Doctor Akagi look him over today for any lasting damage. It is our belief however that Leliel was acting under the influence of someone else."  
碇源堂直视着基尔的眼睛，"我明白，今天我会让赤木博士为他检查是否有任何残留伤害。不过，我们相信 Leliel 是在他人的影响下行动的。"

Keel blinked. 基尔眨了眨眼。

"An Angel working for someone? Preposterous, what makes you believe such a thing?"  
"一个天使为某人工作？荒谬至极，你凭什么相信这种事？"

"We are still investigating this, as mentioned we know Leliel had an assailant, the reasons for which are unknown but it is this assailant who contacted Unit One and ensured he was in the precise place to be captured."  
"我们仍在调查此事，正如之前提到的，我们知道雷利尔有袭击者，其动机不明，但正是这名袭击者联系了第一部队，并确保他出现在被捕的确切地点。"

One of the other committee members entered the conversation between them with their own suggestion. "If you would allow us access to Unit One, we could get the information from him ourselves."  
另一位委员会成员加入了他们的对话，提出了自己的建议。“如果你们允许我们接触第一部队，我们可以亲自从他那里获取信息。”

Keel interrupted him quickly, Gendo smiled at the committee members suggestion. "That won't be necessary we will leave the investigation in your hands Ikari. I want to make it clear however that you understand the penalty for lying to this committee."  
基尔迅速打断了他，碇微笑着回应委员会成员的建议。“那就不必了，我们将把调查工作交给碇。不过，我要明确一点，你明白对本委员会撒谎的后果。”

"Oh I am aware chairman, and we will be investigating thoroughly into this incident to ensure it does not happen again."  
“哦，我非常清楚，主席，我们将彻底调查这一事件，确保它不再发生。”

**NERV Offices – 0915 hours  
NERV 总部 – 上午 0915 时**

"I don't know if I can do this Asuka…" Shinji mumbled.  
“我不知道我能不能做到，明日香……” 真嗣喃喃道。

"You're acting as if you have a choice," Asuka verbally pulled him along. "This is for your own good. If I don't force you to do it, no one else will. And you certainly won't do it by yourself."  
"你表现得好像有选择似的，" 明日香用言语拉着他走。"这是为你好。如果我不逼你做，没人会这么做。而你肯定不会自己去做。"

"I know but…I don't think I'm ready yet."  
"我知道但是……我觉得我还没准备好。"

"Well you have five minutes to _get_ ready. First we're going to our office and we'll inform Katsuragi that I was able to rescue you and I'll be told how great I am."  
"好吧，你有五分钟准备。首先我们去办公室，告诉葛城我已经成功救了你，然后我会被夸得天花乱坠。"

He raised his eyebrow slightly and questioned her, "Is praise all you want?"  
他微微挑起眉毛，问她：“你想要的只是赞美吗？”

"No, what I want is for you to confront your father. Nothing will boost my ego more than to see you confront him."  
“不，我想要的是你去面对你的父亲。没有什么比看到你面对他更能让我感到自豪的了。”

"I don't understand why."  
“我不明白为什么。”

"Because since that incident in that hospital when he was there and didn't even acknowledge you up until now, he's been fucking with both of us and you especially. You're his son and he won't even acknowledge you. So now we know where he is it's time we or I should say you, gave him what he deserved." She wasn't really too sure why she was helping him or forcing him to do this. A few months ago storming into the director's office would have been something she would never have done, she actually wanted to go somewhere in NERV. Now however was a different story, she wasn't just doing this for Shinji. She was doing it to satisfy her own ego, she was tired of being messed with and now she had an excuse to confront it.  
"因为自从那次在医院的事件，他明明在场却对你视而不见，直到现在，他一直在玩弄我们俩，尤其是你。你是他的儿子，他却连承认都不愿意。所以现在我们知道他在哪儿了，是时候——或者应该说你，给他应得的教训了。" 她其实不太确定为什么要帮他，或是逼他这么做。几个月前，闯进指挥官的办公室是她绝不会做的事，她原本还想在 NERV 有所作为。但现在情况不同了，她这么做不仅仅是为了真嗣。她是为了满足自己的自尊心，厌倦了被摆布，现在她有了面对这一切的借口。

"Ok so we go in there, then what?" Shinji questioned.  
"好吧，那我们进去之后呢？" 真嗣问道。

"I don't know," His comrade in arms demonstrated her true skill at planning missions. "I thought you could yell at him a bit, maybe punch him a few times."  
"我不知道，" 这位战友在策划任务方面展现了她的真实水平。"我想你可以对他吼几句，或许打他几拳。"

She was smiling slightly, Shinji attempted to smile back but his voice had a more serious tone.  
她微微一笑，真嗣试图回以微笑，但他的语气却更为严肃。

"Asuka please be serious." he said.  
“明日香，请认真点。”他说道。

"I don't know right, all I know is doing this is for your own good."  
“我不确定，我只知道这样做是为了你好。”

"I'm not sure…" Shinji looked at his reflection in his black polished shoes.  
"我不确定……" 真嗣看着自己黑色抛光鞋中的倒影。

"Look are you a man or what?" Soryhu huffed "He's fucked with us since our first case. You can't run away from him. You need to confront him…"  
"你到底是不是男人？" 总司气呼呼地说，"他从我们接手第一个案子开始就一直在搞我们。你不能逃避他。你需要面对他……"

Asuka was cut off by another woman's voice from outside the elevator  
电梯外另一个女人的声音打断了明日香的话

"Are you two alright?" "你们俩没事吧？"

Both Asuka and Shinji turned there heads and looked outside, neither of them had realized the elevator had come to a stop. Nor had they realized that their raised voices had attracted the attention of Misato, who had been waiting outside their Office.  
明日香和真嗣同时转头望向外面，两人都没意识到电梯已经停了。他们也没注意到，自己提高的嗓门已经引起了在外面等候的美里小姐的注意。

Shinji and Misato locked eyes for a brief moment. For that moment there was no emotion, she just looked blankly at him, not sure whether or not to believe it was really him. She turned to Asuka who had stepped back slightly allowing them both room. Choking on her words she questioned Asuka.  
真嗣和美里目光交汇了一瞬。那一刻，她脸上没有任何表情，只是茫然地看着他，不确定眼前的人是否真的是他。她转向明日香，后者稍稍后退，给他们留出了空间。美里哽咽着向明日香问道。

"You…you brought him back?"  
"你……你把他带回来了？"

"Yeah, I did." "是的，我做到了。"

"What…how?" "怎么……怎么做到的？"

"I don't know, I guess it's just how great I am." The redhead boasted, her chest swelling with pride.  
"我不知道，我想这就是我伟大的地方吧。" 红发女孩自夸道，胸膛因骄傲而挺起。

Misato uttered something Asuka wasn't certain but she was pretty sure it was 'thank you'. That certainty lasted until sometime shortly after Misato had launched herself at Shinji and had begun hugging him tightly, sobbing into his shoulder. Asuka smiled as she saw Shinji trying to catch his breath, the agent half smothered between the older woman's breasts. She casually placed her hand on Misato's shoulder and whispered to her.  
美里咕哝了些什么，明日香不太确定，但她很确定那是'谢谢你'。这种确定感一直持续到美里突然扑向真嗣，紧紧抱住他，在他肩头啜泣。明日香微笑着看到真嗣试图喘口气，这位特工被夹在年长女性的双峰之间。她随意地将手放在美里的肩上，轻声对她说。

"I hate to break this up but Shinji needs air, you're killing him."  
"我不想打断你们，但真嗣需要空气，你快把他闷死了。"

Misato released her grip on Shinji and apologized, she turned to Asuka teary eyed and thanked her again. Asuka just nodded and waited for Misato say something else.  
美里松开了对真嗣的握持，向他道歉，然后泪眼汪汪地转向明日香，再次向她道谢。明日香只是点了点头，等待美里再说些什么。

"What happened, how did you…?"  
“发生了什么，你是怎么……？”

Shinji had been silent the whole time, he merely pointed at Asuka allowing her to explain.  
真嗣一直沉默不语，他只是指了指明日香，示意由她来解释。

"It's complicated, look we'll explain later. We were just coming down here for five minutes, we have a meeting with the Director."  
"情况很复杂，我们稍后解释。我们只是下来这里待五分钟，有个和总监的会议。"

Misato dried her eyes on her sleeves and looked at the two of them in confusion.  
美里用袖子擦干眼泪，困惑地看着他们俩。

"What do you mean a meeting, Shinji's been back five minutes and you already have a meeting with the Director."  
"你说会议是什么意思，真嗣才回来五分钟，你们就已经和总监有会议了。"

"Well it's always best to get things out the way, isn't that right Shinji?" Asuka prodded him with her elbow.  
"嗯，最好先把事情解决掉，不是吗，真嗣？" 明日香用肘轻轻推了他一下。

Shinji didn't respond he just nodded, fearful that if he opened his mouth he'd be sick all over both of them. He felt his fist clenching and unclenching behind his back as he thought about what was about to happen. Did he even want to see his father? It must have been over twenty years since they last spoke, yet his fathers influence was still there, manipulating him. He knew he had to do this he wanted to do it for himself and to somehow try to gain some measure of closure. Yet at the same time he wanted to run, he wanted to go back to Asuka's or Misato's and wait until another day.  
真嗣没有回应，只是点了点头，他害怕一旦开口就会吐在他们两人身上。他感到自己的拳头在背后紧握又松开，思考着即将发生的事情。他真的想见父亲吗？他们上次交谈已经过去二十多年了，但父亲的影响依然存在，操纵着他。他知道自己必须这么做，他想为自己做这件事，试图以某种方式获得一些解脱。然而与此同时，他又想逃跑，想回到明日香或美里那里，等到另一天。

"Is Kaji around today?" "今天加持在吗？"

"I haven't seen him yet, why?"  
"我还没见到他，怎么了？"

Asuka frowned slightly. She had wanted to thank him for telling her where to find Shinji. She had also wanted to know just how Kaji knew where to find him as well, she couldn't place it yet but there was something about her former guardian she couldn't place just yet. She knew he had frequent meetings with Director Ikari and that he knew a lot more than she did, but why would he feed the information down, for what purpose?  
明日香微微皱眉。她本想感谢他告诉她找到真嗣的地方。她还想知道加治是如何知道真嗣的下落的，尽管她目前还无法确定，但她总觉得这位前监护人有些事情她还没弄明白。她知道加治经常与碇司令会面，并且知道的事情比她多得多，但他为什么要透露这些信息，出于什么目的？

"No reason," Asuka dismissed it "If you see him, tell him I want to speak to him."  
"没什么特别的原因，"明日香轻描淡写地说，"如果你见到他，告诉他我想和他谈谈。"

"I will, and Asuka…" "我会的，还有，明日香……"

Asuka paused for a moment.  
明日香顿了一下。

"…Thank you." "……谢谢你。"

Misato turned from the elevator as Asuka pressed the button to go up, she turned to Shinji still smiling. The smile soon faded when she saw how pale he had become, she punched him hard in the arm causing him to shout out.  
美里从电梯旁转身，看着明日香按下上升按钮，她转向真嗣，依旧微笑着。但当她看到他变得多么苍白时，笑容很快消失了，她狠狠地打了他一拳，让他痛得大叫起来。

"Ouch, what was that for?"  
“哎哟，你这是干什么？”

"Stop being so frightened of him, you've had to apprehend telepaths, mutants and half spider things. He's nothing compared to those."  
“别再那么怕他了，你连心灵感应者、变种人和半蜘蛛怪物都抓过。他跟那些比起来根本不算什么。”

"Easy for you to say…"  
“说来容易……”

'_No…it really isn't Shinji…'_ she thought to herself. The rest of the journey continued in silence until they got to the floor they wanted. The lift doors opened and they stepped out into the main corridor. Directly opposite them was the door to the Director's office, She turned to Shinji.  
“不……真嗣，这真的不容易……”她暗自思忖。剩下的路程在沉默中继续，直到他们到达了目的地楼层。电梯门打开，他们踏入了主走廊。正对面就是主任办公室的门，她转向真嗣。

"Ok, here we go. You know what you have to do right?"  
“好了，我们到了。你知道该做什么吧？”

"No."

"Well what do you want to do?"  
"那你想做什么？"

Shinji felt his stomach churning, his words reflected those feelings "At the moment, be sick." he groaned.  
真嗣感到胃里一阵翻腾，他的话语反映了这种感觉：“现在，想吐。”他呻吟道。

"Be serious." "认真点。"

"I don't know, I don't know what to say to him. I don't even want to be here, why are you forcing me to do this?"  
"我不知道，我不知道该对他说什么。我甚至不想待在这里，你为什么要强迫我这样做？"

"For your own good, that's why."  
"为了你好，这就是原因。"

She pushed him towards the door, hesitating he put his hand on the handle and opened it slowly entering. He looked around seeing not his father, but the very person who had helped him many weeks ago. The old man looked at both Shinji and Asuka in surprise and shouted towards them.  
她推着他走向门口，他犹豫了一下，手放在门把手上，缓缓推门而入。他环顾四周，看到的不是他的父亲，而是几周前帮助过他的那位老人。老人惊讶地看着真嗣和明日香，向他们喊道。

"What is the meaning of this?"  
"这是什么意思？"

Shinji looked on stunned he didn't expect this, not at all, he struggled to find some words yet all he could do was say the name of the man who stood before them. "Fuyutsuki?"  
真嗣震惊地看着，他完全没有预料到这种情况，一点也没有。他努力寻找着话语，但最终只能说出站在他们面前的那个人名字。“副司令？”

"Ikari." "碇。"

"Where is he?" “他在哪儿？”

Fuyutsuki tried to feign ignorance, unfortunately for him he had never been too good at lying. "Who?"  
冬月试图装作不知情，不幸的是，他向来不擅长撒谎。“谁？”

"You know who, my father that's who."  
“你知道我说的是谁，我父亲，就是他。”

"So Keel did tell you." The professor shrugged, not really to surprised, "Your father isn't here at the moment Shinji, he's out of Tokyo-3 in a meeting with the very man who orchestrated your capture, and several other important figures."  
"看来基尔确实告诉你了。" 教授耸了耸肩，并不十分惊讶，"你的父亲现在不在这里，真嗣，他离开了东京-3，正在与策划你被捕的那个人以及其他几位重要人物开会。"

Asuka grumbled loudly, "SEELE…"  
明日香大声抱怨道："SEELE……"

"Correct, you probably won't believe this Shinji, and I wouldn't blame you if you didn't, but your father is currently working to protect you from those very people."  
"没错，你可能不会相信，真嗣，如果你不信我也不会怪你，但你的父亲目前正在努力保护你免受那些人的伤害。"

"What do you mean protect me?" Shinji growled. "It's his fault this is happening."  
"你说的保护我是什么意思？" 真嗣咆哮道。"这都是他的错。"

"You don't understand Shinji, Keel cannot be trusted he is working for his own gain but he's also the chairman of SEELE. He was trying to turn you against NERV. We're the good guys Shinji."  
"你不明白，真嗣，基尔不能信任，他只为自己的利益行事，但他同时也是 SEELE 的主席。他试图让你反对 NERV。我们才是好人，真嗣。"

"The good guys? You and my father are taking orders from SEELE, how can you be the good guys in this."  
"好人？你和我父亲都听命于 SEELE，你们怎么可能是好人。"

"That's true, I won't deny that fact but look…it's complicated. GEHIRN, the Evangelion project it was all funded by SEELE and as you now know, it was all done using alien technology. Your mother was involved in creating the serum that flows within you Shinji. Your father oversaw the project."  
“确实，我不会否认这一事实，但你看……这很复杂。GEHIRN，这个《福音战士》项目完全由 SEELE 资助，正如你现在所知，这一切都是利用外星技术完成的。你的母亲参与了制造流淌在你体内的血清。你的父亲负责监督整个项目。”

Asuka looked on stunned at what she had just heard, "His…mother is a part of this as well?"  
明日香震惊地听着这一切，“他的……母亲也参与其中？”

Shinji turned around to her angrily, his voice had risen considerably. "Yes that's right before she was taken she was a part of the team who created the serum."  
真嗣愤怒地转向她，声音明显提高了。“是的，没错，在她被带走之前，她是制造血清团队的成员之一。”

Asuka looked at Fuyutsuki and demanded more from him, "Who else was a part of this?"  
明日香盯着冬月，向他追问：“还有谁参与了这件事？”

He sighed. He wasn't going to get out of this easily. She was going to find out one way or another, "Your mother did as well, both Doctor Yui Ikari and Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu worked to help create the Evangelion serum."  
他叹了口气。看来这次没那么容易脱身了。她迟早会以某种方式查明真相，“你的母亲也是其中之一，碇唯博士和京子·齐柏林·惣流都曾参与协助研发 EVA 血清。”

The revelation hit Asuka like an eighteen wheeler, her own mother was involved. Her own mother had been in some way responsible for what had happened to her. She had known her mother was a scientist and had worked in Japan briefly but had no idea she had worked for GEHIRN. She looked at Fuyutsuki and then back to Shinji, for those moments no one spoke. She felt something burning in the back of her eyes and blinked it away before dashing out of the room. Shinji turned to go after her but Fuyutsuki's voice stopped him in his tracks.  
这个消息对明日香来说犹如一记重锤，她的亲生母亲竟然也牵涉其中。她的母亲在某种程度上要对发生她身上的事负责。她知道母亲是科学家，曾在日本短暂工作过，但从未意识到她曾为 GEHIRN 效力。她看了看冬月，又转向真嗣，那一刻无人言语。她感到眼后有股灼热感，眨了眨眼，随即冲出了房间。真嗣转身欲追，却被冬月的声音定在了原地。

"Look this isn't going to be easy after all that's happened Shinji, but I need you to walk out of this office and forget what happened today. Shinji I want you to trust in your father, please, more will be made clear later, it's just… now isn't the time."  
"听着，经历了这么多事之后，这不会容易的，真嗣，但我需要你走出这间办公室，忘记今天发生的一切。真嗣，我希望你相信你的父亲，请相信，更多的事情以后会明朗，只是……现在还不是时候。"

Shinji desperately wanted to say something, he wanted to stay there and wait, to ignore Fyutsuki's words and confront his father when he returned, but he couldn't. Shinji merely nodded, and stepped out of the room feeling like a bigger coward than he had when he went in there. He stepped outside and sighed, as he shut the door he felt Asuka's presence beside him. He looked her in the eyes, they were glistening with tears but she refused to let them fall. He reached out his hand for her shoulder but she shoved him away, he tried again only to have her shove him again this time more forcefully.  
真嗣迫切地想说些什么，他想留在这里等待，无视律子的劝告，在他父亲回来时面对他，但他做不到。真嗣只是点了点头，走出房间时感觉自己比进去时更加懦弱。他走到外面，叹了口气，关上门时感觉到明日香就在他身边。他看着她的眼睛，泪水在眼眶中闪烁，但她拒绝让它们落下。他伸出手去搭她的肩膀，但她推开了他，他再次尝试，这次她更用力地推开了他。

"Don't touch me." Asuka barked.  
"别碰我。" 明日香厉声说道。

"Sorry I..." "对不起，我..."

"Don't apologize either."  
"也别道歉了。"

Shinji watched her as she walked over to one of the seats and sat down, wiping her eyes slightly. When she caught him looking at her, she immediately looked away trying not to show him she was upset. She kept repeating to herself angrily in her mind, _'I'm not going to cry damnit, I'm not that weak.'_  
真嗣看着她走向一个座位坐下，轻轻擦了擦眼睛。当她发现他在看她时，她立刻移开视线，不想让他看到自己难过。她在心里愤怒地重复着，'我不会哭的，该死，我没那么脆弱。'

Again, Shinji tried to go over to her and again she tried to shove him away. The German woman stood still for a moment unsure of what to do. Shinji wanted to help her, just like she had helped him before, but Asuka wasn't letting him near. How was he supposed to do anything if he couldn't even get near her? Shinji sat down opposite her, his back resting against the wall. Asuka looked at him oddly and spoke, her voice laced with venom.  
又一次，真嗣试图走向她，而她再次试图将他推开。这位德国女性静立片刻，不知所措。真嗣想要帮助她，就像她之前帮助过他一样，但明日香不让他靠近。如果连靠近她都做不到，他又该如何做些什么呢？真嗣坐在她对面，背靠墙壁。明日香奇怪地看着他，语气中带着毒意。

"What are you doing?" “你在做什么？”

"Waiting for you," The grey eyed Agent answered. "I'm not leaving you alone when you're like this."  
“在等你，”灰眸的特工回答，“你这样的时候，我不会离开你一个人。”

She bit back quickly, "Why?"  
她迅速咬住嘴唇，反问道：“为什么？”

He thought for a moment before replying, "Because you're upset, and because you tried to help me."  
他沉思片刻后回答：“因为你现在很难过，也因为你想帮我。”

She didn't take his words too kindly, she knew he was trying to help but she hated looking like this. Her ego wanted him to go away and not feel sorry for her, yet at the same time she was glad he hadn't left.  
她对这番话并不领情，明知他是出于好意，但她讨厌自己这副模样。她的自尊心希望他离开，不要为她感到难过，然而与此同时，她又庆幸他没有离开。

"I'm not upset." "我没生气。"

"Sure you're not." "当然你没生气。"

"Just what is that supposed to mean?" Asuka spat.  
"那到底是什么意思？" 明日香厉声问道。

"You're not upset, just in the same way I didn't want to confront my father."  
"你并没有生气，就像我之前不想面对我父亲一样。"

She looked at him and saw he was grinning. She smiled back at him and wiped her eyes again. "When did you become so happy about what I did, a minute ago you were about to throw up all over me."  
她看着他，发现他在咧嘴笑。她也回以微笑，再次擦了擦眼睛。"你什么时候开始对我做的事这么开心了？一分钟前你还差点吐我一身。"

He nodded, "I know. If you weren't there I would have ran away."  
他点头道："我知道。如果你不在那里，我早就跑了。"

"So I was right then?"  
"所以我当时是对的？"

"As usual, yes." "一如既往，是的。"

He stood up and moved over to her still unsure of what to do, he had never had to deal with this not even when Misato had broke it off with Kaji, he slowly put his arm around her and attempted to sit down. She looked at him oddly and questioned him. "What the hell are you doing?"  
他站起身，挪到她身边，仍不确定该怎么做，他从未遇到过这种情况，甚至当美里和加持分手时也没有。他缓缓地伸出胳膊搂住她，试图坐下。她奇怪地看着他，质问道：“你到底在干什么？”

"I…I'm just...I don't know."  
"我…我只是...我不知道。"

She wasn't sure whether or not to call him an idiot or to admire him for trying, "If you're trying to make me feel better you're doing a rubbish job, sit down."  
她不确定是该骂他傻还是佩服他的尝试，"如果你是想让我感觉好点，那你做得可真糟糕，坐下吧。"

Shinji didn't really have a choice as she had already pulled him down to the seat, what she done next however surprised him. She took his arm and put it round her and rested her head on his shoulder. Shinji pulled her in a bit closer and put his other arm around her, again awkwardly, she sighed and took it round her.  
真嗣其实没得选择，因为她已经把他拉到了座位上，但她接下来的举动却让他吃了一惊。她拉过他的手臂环在自己身上，然后把头靠在他的肩上。真嗣稍稍把她拉近了一些，用另一只手也环住她，尽管动作有些笨拙，她叹了口气，也环住了他。

"You really are rubbish at this, you know that."  
"你真的很不擅长这个，你知道吗。"

"Do you feel better though?"  
"不过你感觉好些了吗？"

"Only because I'm laughing at how pathetic you are at hugging people."  
"只是因为我在笑你抱人有多么可笑。"

Shinji grinned, he had finally caught her out, albeit unintentionally. "So you were upset?"  
真嗣咧嘴笑了，他终于无意中揭穿了她。“所以你当时很生气？”

She looked up at him and realized she couldn't deny it anymore. "You…." She gave in and admitted it angrily, "…yes I was. There, are you happy now?"  
她抬头看着他，意识到自己再也无法否认。“你……”她气愤地承认了，“……是的，我生气了。这下你满意了吧？”

He looked at her, it wasn't really going to plan when he tried it, he thought he was being slightly brave. Usually he would have ran or stood there in silence but he felt obligated to do this. "No, I'm not really doing a good job of this."  
他看着她，事情并没有按照他预想的那样发展，他觉得自己当时有点勇敢。通常他会逃跑或者站在那里沉默不语，但他觉得有义务这么做。“不，我做得并不好。”

"I could have told you that, just keep going on the way you are I'll laugh at you a bit more and I'll feel better in minutes."  
"我本可以告诉你的，就照你现在这样继续下去，我再多笑你一会儿，几分钟后我就会感觉好多了。"

Shinji let go of her and looked at her dejected, "I'm only trying to help."  
真嗣松开了她，沮丧地看着她，"我只是想帮忙。"

She took his arms and put them back around her, "I know…"  
她拉过他的手臂重新环抱住自己，"我知道……"

They sat in silence for a few more moments, Shinji holding Asuka and her tightly holding him. She looked up into his eyes and whispered to him, "Shinji…did you know?"  
他们又静静地坐了一会儿，真嗣抱着明日香，而她紧紧地抱着他。她抬头望进他的眼睛，轻声问道：“真嗣……你知道吗？”

"About what?" "关于什么？"

She paused before continuing, ready to just tell him to forget it, but she wanted to know. "About my mother…that she was somehow involved with this. That she was responsible for parts of Project Eva and the serum we were injected with?"  
她顿了顿，本想让他忘了这事，但她真的很想知道。“关于我母亲……她与这件事有关。她是 EVA 计划和注射给我们血清的部分负责人吗？”

Shinji stopped, he had known. Keel had told him when he was in that false reality. He wasn't sure whether or not to believe it though, why should he have believed it. It could have just been another lie after all it didn't make much sense Asuka's mother being involved in it. Shinji didn't even know anything about Asuka's family, only that she was brought up in Germany. "Asuka…I, when I was in that other place when Keel and Leliel took me. Keel told me certain things about the serum he told me that the serum was developed by three scientists. My mother, Kyoko Sohryu, your mother and someone called Naoko Akagi. I didn't know if what he said was the truth though, otherwise I would have told you."  
真嗣停了下来，他确实知道。基尔在那个虚假的现实中告诉过他。但他不确定是否应该相信，为什么要相信呢。毕竟，那可能只是另一个谎言，明日香的母亲参与其中并不合逻辑。真嗣对明日香的家庭一无所知，只知道她在德国长大。“明日香……我，当我在那个其他地方，基尔和雷利尔带我去的时候。基尔告诉我关于血清的一些事情，他说血清是由三位科学家开发的。我的母亲，惣流·京子，你的母亲，还有一位叫赤木直子的女士。不过，我不知道他说的到底是不是真的，否则我早就告诉你了。”

"Would you?" "你会吗？"

"Yes I would." "是的，我会。"

That was all she needed, she lifted her head up and kissed him tenderly on the cheek before whispering to him again. "Thank you."  
这就是她所需要的，她抬起头，温柔地在他脸颊上吻了一下，然后再次低声对他说：“谢谢你。”

**Crime Scene – 1115 hours  
犯罪现场 —— 11 时 15 分**

Gendo looked down at the dead body, it's skin a pale white, its arms punctured with various holes, each one oozing LCL. Slowly he kneeled down next to the body and removed a small test tube from his jacket pocket along with a small pair of steel tweezers. He looked around making sure no one was nearby and inserted the tweezers into the hole in the victims arm. He withdrew them and smirked. Impaled on the end was a dense black slime. He observed it for a few moments watching as it seemed to squirm on the end of his instrument. He placed it in the test tube and closed the end quickly watching as the black slime moved up and down the tube desperately, almost as if it wanted to escape.  
源渡低头看着那具尸体，皮肤苍白如纸，双臂布满孔洞，每个孔洞都渗出 LCL 液体。他缓缓跪在尸体旁，从夹克口袋里掏出一支小试管和一对细小的钢制镊子。他环顾四周，确保附近无人，然后将镊子插入受害者手臂的孔洞中。他取出镊子，嘴角露出一丝冷笑。镊子尖端夹着一团浓稠的黑色粘液。他观察了一会儿，看着它在工具尖端蠕动。他将粘液放入试管，迅速封口，注视着黑色粘液在管内上下窜动，拼命挣扎，仿佛想要逃脱。

Watching it move around almost sickened him. That thing wasn't living it was just existing, existing to feed from one body to another until it either died or simply ran out of food. It was perhaps the one part of the Angel Project he truly feared, just because it was the only thing that was never human.  
看着它在管内四处移动，几乎让他感到恶心。那东西并非活着，只是存在，从一个身体转移到另一个身体，直到它死去或食物耗尽。这或许是他在天使计划中唯一真正恐惧的部分，因为它从未是人类。

He slipped the test tube into his pocked and snapped on a pair of gloves, looking around the body again. He rummaged inside one of the pockets and pulled out a cell phone, with it was a sheet of paper with a number hastily scribbled across it. He took his own cell phone and dialed a number.  
他将试管滑入口袋，啪地一声戴上手套，再次环顾尸体。他在其中一个口袋里摸索，掏出了一部手机，还有一张纸上潦草地写着一串号码。他拿出自己的手机，拨了一个号码。

"Fuyutsuki, we have a problem."  
“冬月，我们有麻烦了。”

"_Yes I know I've just had Shinji and Asuka in here. They know about you, and they know about the serum and its creators."_  
“是的，我刚接待了真嗣和明日香。他们知道你的事，也知道血清及其制造者的事。”

"I see, so our fears have been confirmed. I do not know what Keel is planning. I want you to have Kaji look into it, I will be returning to NERV soon with Dr Akagi."  
"看来，我们的担忧被证实了。我不清楚基尔在策划什么。我希望你能让加持去调查一下，我很快会带着赤木博士回到 NERV。"

"_I see, what of the scene?"_  
"我明白了，现场情况如何？"

"Just as we suspected, it's Bardiel."  
"正如我们所料，是巴迪尔。"

There was a pause, after which Fuyutsuki responded. _"God help us."_  
沉默片刻后，冬月回应道：“愿神明保佑我们。”

"Indeed." “确实。”

Gendo closed the cell phone and stood up just in time to be greeted by Ritsuko, she looked down at the body and then to him. She didn't need to ask to know the severity of the situation.  
源堂合上手机，站起身来，正好迎面碰上律子。她低头看了一眼尸体，又转向他。无需询问，她已明白局势的严重性。

"Bardiel?" "巴迪尔？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"Do we have a sample of it?"  
"我们有它的样本吗？"

"Yes, alive for how long I don't know. It's looking for another host though, luckily it left this behind."  
"是的，但不知道它能存活多久。不过幸运的是，它在寻找新宿主时留下了这个。"

He handed her the piece of paper with the cell phone number wrote on it, and dialed it into her own phone. It rang for a few times before going onto an answering machine message. As it voice spoke she felt something strange, almost as if she recognized the voice. Gendo noticed her expression immediately and questioned her.  
他递给她那张写着手机号码的纸条，她随即输入到自己的手机里。电话响了几声后转到了语音信箱。当那个声音响起时，她感到一种莫名的熟悉感，仿佛认得这个声音。碇注意到她的表情，立刻询问她。

"What's wrong?" "怎么了？"

"This voice…I recognize it."  
“这个声音……我认得。”

"Who is it?" “是谁？”

She pulled the phone away from her ear and hung up, before speaking the name quietly, "Shinji's friend, Touji Suzahara."  
她将电话从耳边移开，挂断后轻声念出了那个名字，“真嗣的朋友，铃原东治。”

Gendo thought for a moment, this changed quite a lot. Suzahara was involved. He was a friend of Shinji's. "Ritsuko, I want you to run a trace on that number, make sure it is Suzahara. If it is I will want Katsuragi and Ayanami on surveillance of his residence. I will inform Shinji and Sohryu myself of this angel."  
碇源堂沉思片刻，情况变化颇大。铃原东治牵涉其中，他是真嗣的朋友。“律子，我要你追踪那个号码，确认是否是东治。如果是的话，我要葛城和绫波监视他的住所。我会亲自通知真嗣和明日香关于这个使徒的事。”

"Inform them yourself?" “亲自通知他们？”

"Yes, this is unlike anything they have encountered. I also want you to prepare the dummy plug."  
"是的，这是他们前所未遇的情况。我也希望你能准备好替身插头。"

### Chapter 20 Skin Of Evil

_20__th_ _July 2015_ 2015 年 7 月 20 日

**Morgue – 1030 hours 太平间 – 上午 10:30**

Hikari turned off the recording machine and looked across at the body she had just examined. She still couldn't understand it, aside from the three puncture marks on the man's arm there was nothing else that could have killed him. Even then the puncture marks weren't deep enough to cause any serious harm. The only thing that she had found were trace amounts of a thick black liquid.  
光关闭了录音机，目光扫过刚刚检查过的尸体。她仍然无法理解，除了男子手臂上的三个刺痕外，没有任何其他可能导致他死亡的迹象。即便如此，这些刺痕也并不深，不足以造成严重伤害。她唯一发现的是微量浓稠的黑色液体。

She got up from her seat just in time to see Asuka and Shinji walking into the room. She went over and greeted them both.  
她从座位上起身，正好看到明日香和真嗣走进房间。她走过去向他们两人打招呼。

"Hi, hope you two don't mind me calling you here."  
“嗨，希望你们不介意我叫你们来。”

"No trouble," Asuka dismissed it. Beside's we already owe you one for that unofficial autopsy you did for us. What's the problem anyway?"  
"没什么麻烦的，" 明日香轻描淡写地说。再说了，我们还得感谢你帮我们做的那次非正式尸检呢。到底是什么问题？"

"We got a body in late last night, eyewitness reports said the guy went insane in a local shopping center. He killed several people and left quite a mess. Anyway, after this trail of destruction the guy seemed to just drop down stone dead. The body was brought in and identified and I performed the autopsy."  
"昨晚深夜送来了一具尸体，目击者称那家伙在当地购物中心发了疯。他杀了好几个人，留下一片狼藉。总之，在这番破坏之后，那家伙似乎突然就倒地身亡了。尸体被送来并确认身份后，我进行了尸检。"

"Who is the guy?" Sorhyu questioned.  
"那家伙是谁？" 索尔修问道。"

"Ichiro Sato, a nineteen year old student. No history of violence, pretty typical straight A sort of student. Kept to himself and as you can see, he doesn't really look like he was the type to destroy a section of a shopping mall."  
"一郎·佐藤，十九岁学生。无暴力史，相当典型的全 A 型学生。他独来独往，如你所见，他看起来并不像是那种会摧毁购物中心一部分的人。"

"When you say 'destroyed', what exactly are you referring to?" Shinji queried.  
"当你说‘摧毁’时，你具体指的是什么？" 真嗣询问道。"

"Eye witness reports say he showed almost superhuman strength," Doctor Horaki answered. "Picking people up and throwing them across the room. He was even able to choke the life out of someone with no effort at all."  
"目击者报告称他展现了近乎超人的力量，" 宝生博士回答道，"能将人举起并扔到房间的另一边。他甚至能毫不费力地掐死一个人。"

Asuka looked at her oddly, not really believing it. "One kid was able to do all that?"  
明日香奇怪地看着她，不太相信。“一个孩子能做到所有这些？”

"That's what the reports say. I had them send the security camera footage your way. I hope you don't mind, it just seemed like something you two would be interested in."  
“报告上是这么说的。我让他们把监控录像发给你了。希望你不介意，我只是觉得你们俩会对这个感兴趣。”

Asuka and Shinji exchanged glances. While it was true they would normally have been interested in something like this, both of them had other things on their minds. Still, it was their job to investigate this sort of thing so they couldn't really disagree. Shinji shook his head and replied, "Its fine, we weren't working on anything at the moment."  
明日香和真嗣交换了一下眼神。虽然他们通常会对这种事情感兴趣，但两人此刻都有其他心事。不过，调查这类事情是他们的工作，所以他们无法真正反对。真嗣摇了摇头回答道：“没事，我们目前没在忙什么。”

Hikari continued explaining the details, "Anyway he went on his rampage and then he just dropped dead. I performed the autopsy and can't find any explanation for it. The guy was in perfect health otherwise."  
光继续解释细节，“总之他开始大闹一场，然后就突然死了。我进行了尸检，但找不到任何解释。那家伙其他方面健康得很。”

Asuka questioned her, "Any history of mental illness?"  
明日香问她，“有没有精神病史？”

Hikari shook her head, "No nothing, police are interviewing his friends and people who knew him but, like I said, so far nothings come up."  
光摇摇头，“没有，什么都没有，警方正在询问他的朋友和认识他的人，但就像我说的，到目前为止什么都没发现。”

Asuka continued, "So did you find anything?"  
明日香继续问道：“那么，你发现了什么吗？”

"Well there was something, on the person's arm. I found three small puncture wounds. There was some sort of liquid in it, at first I thought it might have been LCL but it was darker than that."  
“嗯，确实有些发现，在那个人的手臂上。我发现了三个小刺孔，里面有些液体，起初我以为是 LCL，但它比 LCL 颜色更深。”

This instantly caught both Asuka and Shinji's interest. They both let Hikari show them the wounds on the body, Asuka looked first. Just as Hikari had said there were three small wounds on the arm and what seems to be an LCL-like liquid leaking out of it.  
这立刻引起了明日香和真嗣的兴趣。他们让光希展示给他们看尸体上的伤口，明日香先看了。正如光希所说，手臂上有三个小伤口，似乎有类似 LCL 的液体从中渗出。

"Interesting, could you excuse us for a minute Hikari?"  
"有意思，你能回避一下吗，光？"

"Sure." "当然可以。"

Asuka turned to Shinji and spoke quietly, "What do you think?"  
明日香转向真嗣，低声问道：“你怎么看？”

He looked at the LCL again, "Not sure, it looks like LCL and by the sounds of things it could be an angel, doesn't make any sense though why would the Angel just die so suddenly?"  
他又看了一眼 LCL，“不确定，看起来像是 LCL，而且听上去可能是个使徒，但说不通的是，为什么使徒会突然死去？”

"I guess that's what we have to figure out, I'll get Hikari to run some tests on it to make sure it is LCL. We'll contact Katsuragi and Kaji, Kaji knows about the conspiracy and maybe he could shed some light on it."  
"我想这就是我们需要弄清楚的，我会让光来对它进行一些测试，确保它是 LCL。我们会联系葛城和加持，加持知道这个阴谋，也许他能提供一些线索。"

"Kaji knows?" "加持知道？"

"He told me where to find the alien craft you were being held in, even if he doesn't know about the full conspiracy, he still knows something."  
"他告诉我在哪里可以找到关押你的外星飞船，即使他不知道整个阴谋的全貌，他还是知道一些事情。"

"He knows my father." "他认识我父亲。"

"Yes it looks like it, but he's on our side."  
"是的，看起来是这样，但他站在我们这边。"

Shinji eyed her suspiciously, "How can you be sure?"  
真嗣怀疑地看着她，“你怎么能确定？”

She snapped back at him, "I just am alright, I lived with the guy, we can trust him."  
她厉声回敬他，“我只是还好，我和那家伙一起生活过，我们可以信任他。”

Hikari raised her eyebrows when she heard Asuka snapping at Shinji, she went over to them and questioned them. "Are you two alright?"  
听到明日香对真嗣发火，光皱起眉头，走过去询问他们。“你们俩还好吗？”

Asuka sighed and turned to her, "It's nothing just a…disagreement that's all. Look can you run so…"  
明日香叹了口气，转向她，“没什么，只是……一点争执罢了。听着，你能跑吗……”

She trailed off as her cell phone began to ring, it was Misato. She apologized to Hikari and answered the call.  
她的手机铃声响起，是美里。她向光道歉后接起了电话。

"Sohryu here." “这里是惣流。”

"_The case you and Shinji left to investigate, I heard the message from Agent Horaki, there's been another incident, Rei is waiting for you outside I want all three of you to make your way down there immediately."_  
“你们和真嗣去调查的那个案件，我收到了代理探员光的消息，又发生了一起事件。丽在外面等你们，我要你们三个立刻赶过去。”

**Crime Scene – 1230 hours  
犯罪现场 —— 12 时 30 分**

"What the hell could have caused this?"  
“这到底是怎么回事？”

Even though Shinji had said it, it was the question on all three of their minds. The store was a complete mess. Even Rei couldn't hide her shock at what had happened. There was a huge hole in the wall at the back of the store, from where something seemed to have been thrown through it. There were at least fifteen dead in the store, their blood splattered the walls and the floor. All the items on the shelves were scattered around making it near impossible to move easily.  
尽管这话是真嗣说的，但这问题却萦绕在他们三人心头。店铺内一片狼藉。就连绫波也无法掩饰她对所发生之事的震惊。后墙被撞出了一个大洞，似乎有什么东西从那里被抛了出去。店内至少有十五人丧生，他们的血迹溅满了墙壁和地板。货架上的物品散落一地，几乎让人难以自如移动。

Asuka knelt down next to one of the bodies and examined it curiously. It was near identical to the body they had looked at in the morgue earlier. The same puncture marks on the arm with LCL leaking from each one. Asuka looked in a bit closer and turned to Shinji, calling him over.  
明日香跪在一具尸体旁，好奇地检查着。它与他们早些时候在太平间看过的那具尸体几乎一模一样。手臂上同样有穿刺痕迹，每个伤口都渗出 LCL 液体。明日香凑得更近，转身叫上真嗣。

"Shinji, take a look at this…same deal as last time."  
“真嗣，过来看看……和上次一样的情况。”

"Is he responsible for all this?"  
“这一切都是他干的吗？”

"I don't know, but he has the same three puncture marks as the last person. There seems to be some LCL leaking from it but it's murkier and denser than what we've seen before."  
"我不知道，但他和上一个受害者一样，有三处穿刺伤。似乎有某种 LCL 液体从伤口渗出，但比我们之前见到的更浑浊、更浓稠。"

Shinji lifted up the arm and looked at the puncture marks, he jumped suddenly taking Asuka down with him. She sat up and glared death at him, he turned to her apologizing profusely.  
真嗣抬起那条手臂，仔细观察着穿刺伤，突然他跳了起来，连带着把明日香也拽倒了。她坐起身，狠狠地瞪着他，他转向她，连连道歉。

"Sorry." "对不起。"

"So you should be, what were you playing at?"  
"你确实该道歉，刚才你到底在搞什么鬼？"

He pointed at the arm he had been looking at before she jumped and immediately saw what had caused the reaction. Moving around in one of the wounds was a black liquid. It seemed to be pushing its way out of the wound where it leaked out as the denser LCL.  
他指向之前她跳跃时他一直在观察的那只手臂，立刻明白了是什么引起了反应。在其中一个伤口中，一种黑色液体正在移动。它似乎正努力从伤口中挤出，流出时变成了更为浓稠的 LCL。

Asuka spoke. "Is that LCL?"  
明日香开口问道：“那是 LCL 吗？”

Shinji replied cautiously watching the LCL, "I'm not sure, it seems to be…I don't know. It's acting like its alive."  
真嗣谨慎地观察着 LCL，回答道：“我不确定，它看起来像是……我不知道。它的行为像是活的。”

She was tempted to ridicule him, but the more she looked at it the more she could see that he was right, it did seem to be moving and acting as if it was trying to flee. It picked up speed seemingly trying to escape. Asuka quickly took out a sampling kit and captured the liquid in a test tube. She turned to Ayanami who was keeping a distance from the liquid.  
她本想嘲笑他，但越看越觉得他说的没错，那液体确实在动，仿佛试图逃跑。它加速移动，似乎在试图逃脱。明日香迅速拿出采样工具，将液体装入试管。她转向绫波，后者正与液体保持距离。

"Ayanami, what do you know about this?"  
“绫波，你对这东西了解多少？”

Rei was obviously frightened, although it was different to how she had seemed before. This wasn't some small childhood fear of spiders that Asuka teased her about, this was complete fear. The very sight of it made her not only scared for herself but for everyone around her. Her fear was evident with the way she spoke,  
绫波显然很害怕，尽管这与她之前的反应不同。这不是明日香常取笑她的那种对蜘蛛的小孩恐惧，而是彻底的恐惧。光是看到那液体，她不仅为自己感到害怕，也为周围的人感到害怕。她的恐惧在她的言辞中表露无遗，

"It's dangerous we can't let it near us." she said.  
"这东西很危险，我们不能让它靠近我们。" 她说道。

"What is it?" “怎么了？”

Rei didn't respond, Asuka and Shinji weren't sure if this was because she was frightened or because she felt she couldn't. Asuka asked again, sounding more agitated.  
丽没有回应，明日香和真嗣不确定这是因为她害怕还是因为她觉得自己不能。明日香再次问道，语气更加焦躁。

"Look we already know about the Angels and what they are, is this the work of another one. What happens if we get this…" Asuka struggled for a word to describe it, black goo just didn't seem to be a very good fit at the moment. She looked again at the other area around the wound and how the liquid fades into a murkier LCL and finally found a name for it, "…this Black LCL on us?"  
"听着，我们已经知道使徒是什么以及它们的本质，这是不是另一个使徒的杰作？如果我们沾上了这个……" 明日香努力寻找一个合适的词来形容它，黑色的粘液此刻似乎并不贴切。她再次看向伤口周围的其他区域，以及液体如何逐渐融入更浑浊的 LCL，最终找到了一个名字，"……这种黑色 LCL，会发生什么？"

"It's not a normal angel, it wasn't created the sa…"  
"这不是一个普通的使徒，它不是以那种方式被创造的……"

She trailed off when she felt a pain shoot through her stomach, both Asuka and Shinji looked at her oddly, awaiting her next words. Rei opened her mouth to speak but closed it again when she felt another pain shoot through her. Shinji stood up and went over to her putting his arm around her, "Ayanami are you feeling alright?"  
她话音未落，突然感到一阵剧痛穿透腹部，绫波零和真嗣都奇怪地看着她，等待她继续说下去。绫波张嘴欲言，却又因另一阵疼痛而闭上了嘴。真嗣站起身，走过去搂住她，问道：“绫波，你还好吗？”

She pushed him away and turned from him, trying to run out of the store but before she was able to get to the exit she felt another sharp pain shoot through her. This time she bent over throwing up pure LCL. She felt herself growing dizzier as she heaved again vomiting up the rest of the contents of her stomach. She stopped vomiting and dropped to her knees but the pain continued to shoot through her, both Asuka and Shinji shot each other concerned glances and ran over to her.  
她推开他，转身试图跑出商店，但在到达出口前，她又感到一阵剧痛袭来。这一次，她弯下腰，吐出了纯 LCL。随着她再次呕吐，她感到自己越来越晕眩，将胃里的东西全部吐了出来。她停止呕吐，跪倒在地，但疼痛依旧不断袭来，绫波零和真嗣担忧地互望一眼，急忙跑向她。

Asuka helped Shinji get her up and move her away, as they lay her down they could hear Rei apologizing as a tear rolled down her cheek. She wiped it away as they tried to console her.  
明日香帮着真嗣将她扶起，挪开时，他们听到绫波在道歉，一滴泪珠滑过她的脸颊。她拭去泪水，他们试图安慰她。

"Its fine, what happened?"  
“没事的，发生了什么？”

Rei pointed at the body and the black liquid and spoke quietly, "That did."  
绫波指向那具尸体和黑色液体，轻声说道：“是那个。”

Asuka looked at her oddly and then to the test tube on the floor near the body with the black LCL in it, "You mean this is what caused that?"  
明日香奇怪地看了她一眼，然后转向地板上靠近那具尸体、装着黑色 LCL 的试管，“你是说这是罪魁祸首？”

Rei nodded and apologized again, "Yes, I'm sorry."  
绫波点点头，再次道歉，“是的，对不起。”

"It's alright Rei, it's nothing to be ashamed of. Maybe it might be best if you waited outside and got a bit of fresh air."  
“没事的，绫波，没什么好羞愧的。或许你最好在外面等一会儿，呼吸点新鲜空气。”

"I will, sorry." "我会注意的，抱歉。"

Rei stood up and walked out of the store as quickly as she could. Shinji looked over at the LCL Rei had thrown up and felt a surge of nausea in his own stomach. Asuka quickly noticed this and brought his focus back to her.  
丽迅速站起身，尽可能快地走出了商店。真嗣看向丽吐出的 LCL，感到自己的胃也一阵翻腾。明日香很快注意到这一点，将他的注意力拉回到她身上。

"You'd better not do that as well, it's disgusting."  
"你最好别也那样，太恶心了。"

"Sorry, not really a sight I wanted to see first thing of the morning though."  
"抱歉，这真不是我一大早想看到的光景。"

"Same, lets just focus on getting this body looked at. I want to know more about this Black LCL."  
"同感，我们还是集中精力检查这具尸体吧。我想了解更多关于这种黑色 LCL 的情况。"

Shinji stopped and thought for a moment, before looking at the body and the scene around him. Also taking into account the body from earlier he tried to think of some sort of explanation. The Black LCL seemed to be alive, if only at a basic level it seemed to live just to survive. If he combined that with what Rei had said but them not going near it, then maybe it was alive.  
真嗣停下脚步，沉思片刻，然后环视四周的尸体和现场。结合之前那具尸体的情况，他试图找出一个合理的解释。这种黑色 LCL 似乎具有生命迹象，尽管只是最基本的生命活动，它似乎仅为了生存而存在。如果将这一点与绫波所说的他们没有靠近它的情况结合起来，那么或许它真的是活的。

"It could a parasite." Shinji theorized.  
"可能是寄生虫。" 真嗣推测道。

"What?" "什么？"

"Take a look at the Black LCL again and then look at the wounds on the body. They are identical to the wounds on the body found in the morgue yes?"  
"再看看黑色 LCL，然后对比一下尸体上的伤口。这些伤口与停尸房里发现的尸体上的伤口一模一样，对吧？"

She looked at the LCL again shifting uncomfortable as it moved around, "Well yes I understand that but how can a liquid be parasitic?"  
她再次看向 LCL，不安地看着它蠕动，"“我明白你的意思，但液体怎么可能具有寄生性呢？”

"I don't know, but it fits doesn't it? I mean its present in both the bodies so far and Ayanami said it was dangerous maybe that's because if we let it on us it'll infect us "  
"我不知道，但它确实符合，不是吗？我是说，到目前为止，它存在于两具身体中，绫波说它很危险，可能是因为如果我们让它附在我们身上，它会感染我们。"

"Makes sense I guess, but if that's the case then where is the rest of it? Have we captured it? Is it dead because its host is dead?"  
"听起来有道理，但如果真是这样，那么剩下的部分在哪里？我们抓住它了吗？它是因为宿主死了而死了吗？"

"It'll be looking for a suitable host. Or it might already have one." something about that worried Shinji, but he shook it off and continued. " It'll feast on the host enough for it to be able to survive to the next host, leaving behind a small part of itself in the host each time."  
"它会在寻找合适的宿主。或者它可能已经有了一个。" 这个想法让真嗣有些担忧，但他摇了摇头继续说。"它会吸取宿主足够的养分以存活到下一个宿主，每次都会在宿主体内留下一小部分自己。"

Asuka nodded, surprised at Shinji's explanation. It seemed to make sense. "Right, so we need to find the symbiote and destroy or capture it."  
明日香点点头，对真嗣的解释感到惊讶。似乎说得通。“对，所以我们需要找到那个共生体并摧毁或捕获它。”

"Maybe, if we kill the host before the symbiote finishes feeding then maybe that will die as well."  
“也许，如果我们能在共生体完成进食前杀死宿主，那么它可能也会死。”

"I see, since when were you an expert on parasites anyway?"  
“我明白了，话说你什么时候成了寄生虫方面的专家了？”

"I'm not, I just watch a lot of Sci Fi shows."  
"我不是，我只是看了很多科幻剧。"

Sounding agitated she responded, "Well that's convenient, so you're basing your guess on something from an episode of Star Trek."  
她听起来有些激动，回应道：“那倒是方便，所以你是根据一集《星际迷航》来猜测的。”

"Stargate SG1 actually but there was an episode of Star Trek once with a black liquid that had sentience."  
"其实是《星际之门 SG-1》，不过《星际迷航》有一集确实讲过一种有意识的黑色液体。"

"I don't care about that. You do know that shit's not real Shinji?" Asuka scowled at her colleagues fanboyishness. "Can we just focus on this, you can tell me about your sci fi collection some time later."  
"我才不在乎那个。你难道不知道那玩意儿不是真的吗，真嗣？" 明日香皱着眉头看着同事的狂热。"我们能不能专注于眼前的事，你的科幻收藏改天再聊吧。"

"Sorry." Shinji's eyes wandered back over to where Rei had been ill, though he felt Asuka psychically pulling his face back to look at her.  
"对不起。" 真嗣的目光又飘向了丽刚才生病的地方，尽管他感觉到明日香在心灵上把他拉回来，让他看着她。

"I told you I don't want you being ill as well, especially right beside me."  
"我告诉过你，我也不想你生病，尤其是就在我旁边。"

"I'm not going to be sick," Shinji mumbled. "I'm just wondering if Rei's reaction was because of the black LCL."  
"我不会生病的，" 真嗣喃喃自语。"我只是想知道零的反应是不是因为那种黑色的 LCL。"

"She looked to be afraid of it," Asuka remarked. "But I didn't think she'd throw up because of it."  
"她看起来很害怕，" 明日香评论道。"但我没想到她会因为这而呕吐。"

"I don't mean that. I mean the black LCL actually caused the reaction. It wasn't because she was scared, it seemed to be because she was close to it, possibly because of the serum."  
"我不是那个意思。我是说，黑色的 LCL 实际上引发了她的反应。不是因为她害怕，而是因为她靠近了它，可能是因为那种血清。"

"I see what you mean. It _is_ possible, but if that's the case, why aren't we heaving our guts up right now?" She paused for a moment before continuing, "Unless, I think Rei has a higher concentration of it than us, I mean she threw up what looks like pure LCL."  
"我明白你的意思。这有可能，但如果真是这样，为什么我们现在没有吐得死去活来呢？" 她顿了一下，接着说，"除非，我觉得丽体内的浓度比我们高，我是说她吐出来的看起来像是纯 LCL。"

"Thanks for the thought."  
"谢谢你的关心。"

"No problem, but look at us we're fine aren't we? Last time just after we had been injected, you fell ill in that alleyway and threw up LCL."  
"没事，不过你看我们现在不都好好的吗？上次刚注射完，你在那条巷子里就病倒了，还吐出了 LCL。"

He murmured in embarrassment, "Thanks for reminding me."  
他尴尬地低声说道：“谢谢你提醒我。”

"And I…when I was on the 'Over the Rainbow' I…" She paused for a moment trying to bring herself to say it, she hated being ill it made her look weak and the 'Over The Rainbow' incident was something she had wanted to forget "…Well I wasn't feeling too good myself."  
“而我……在《彩虹之上》时我……”她停顿了一下，试图鼓起勇气说出口，她讨厌生病，那让她显得软弱，而《彩虹之上》的事件是她想要遗忘的，“……好吧，我自己感觉也不太好。”

"Even so why would she have a higher concentration of serum in her though, it's not like she needs it."  
“即便如此，为什么她的血清浓度会更高呢，她并不需要它。”

"I don't know but our dosage is the same. We were injected once and have had nothing since then. She was injected long before us. When you first encountered her she was showing signs of the serum and she knows your father."  
"我不知道，但我们的剂量是一样的。我们只被注射过一次，之后就再也没有了。她在我们之前很久就被注射了。你第一次遇到她时，她已经表现出血清的迹象，而且她认识你父亲。"

Asuka trailed off immediately cursing herself at letting those words out, she didn't mean to tell Shinji that or at least not just yet, much to her surprise though he just looked at her smiling.  
明日香立刻停了下来，暗自咒骂自己不小心说漏了嘴，她本不想这么快告诉真嗣，至少不是现在。然而，令她惊讶的是，他只是微笑着看着她。

"I already know she does, she hasn't told me anything though."  
"我已经知道她认识，不过她还没告诉我任何事情。"

Relieved somewhat she kept going, "Well it makes sense then she's been given a higher dosage, that's why her reaction was stronger to this. How are you feeling right now?"  
她稍感宽慰，继续说道：“这么说来，她被给予了更高剂量的药物，难怪她的反应会更强烈。你现在感觉怎么样？”

Puzzled he looked at her, "I'm fine I guess, I have a bit of a headache but that's probably because of what happened before."  
他困惑地看着她，“我想我还好，只是有点头疼，可能是因为之前发生的事。”

"We should ask her about it, I'm sick of her telling us things when its convenient. What if one of us died but she could have prevented it by saying something."  
“我们应该问问她，我受够了她总是在方便的时候才告诉我们事情。万一我们中的一个因此丧命，而她本可以提前说些什么来阻止呢。”

Shinji thought about it for a moment he thought maybe she was right but he knew Ayanami wouldn't let something like that happen. "I think if our lives were at risk she wouldn't hold anything back, give her a bit more credit than that."  
真嗣思索片刻，心想或许她是对的，但他知道绫波不会让那种事发生。“我认为如果我们的生命受到威胁，她不会有所保留，我们应该给她更多的信任。”

Asuka shrugged off his defense of Rei, "Look we need to ask her more, she knows more then she's letting on."  
明日香对他的辩护不以为意，“听着，我们需要多问她一些，她知道的比她透露的要多。”

"I know that but we can't say anything right now…"  
“我知道，但我们现在不能说什么……”

"Why not?" “为什么不呢？”

"Because she's upset and probably embarrassed at what happened."  
"因为她很难过，可能还对发生的事情感到尴尬。"

She sighed and gave in, "Oh right fine, we'll let her have her third emotion and calm down but then I want more information from her."  
她叹了口气，妥协道：“好吧好吧，我们让她体验一下第三种情绪，冷静下来，但之后我需要从她那里得到更多信息。”

"Right, I'm sure she'll appreciate it and tell us what we want to know."  
"对，我相信她会感激的，然后告诉我们想知道的事情。"

"She'll appreciate it? Don't get the wrong idea I'm not doing this for her."  
"她会感激的吧？别误会，我这么做不是为了她。"

Shinji wasn't sure how to take this, after Leliel he felt he knew Asuka a bit better but there were still things he wasn't sure about. The way she made decisions and acted still confused him, he questioned her "Who are you doing it for, yourself?"  
真嗣不确定该如何理解这番话，经历了力天使事件后，他觉得自己对明日香有了更深的了解，但仍有许多事情让他摸不着头脑。她做决定和行动的方式依旧让他困惑，他问她：“那你这么做是为了谁，你自己吗？”

"No, for once I'm not. I'm doing this for you Shinji. If you didn't ask me to wait I would have went out there myself and asked her."  
"不，这次不是。我这么做是为了你，真嗣。如果你没让我等，我早就自己出去问她了。"

**Stooges Residence – 1420 hours  
三傻住所 – 14 时 20 分**

"Touji, there's a car outside."  
“觉，外面有辆车。”

Touji sighed and got up from his seat, he wandered over to the window where Kensuke was looking out. Just as he had said there was a dark blue estate car parked directly across from the apartment block. Touji shrugged and went back over to his seat, Kensuke stopped him as he was halfway across the room.  
觉叹了口气，从座位上起身，晃悠到窗户边，看见真希正往外看。正如他所说，一辆深蓝色的旅行车正停在公寓楼对面。觉耸了耸肩，转身准备回到座位上，真希在他走到房间中央时拦住了他。

"Well don't you think it's a bit strange?"  
"你不觉得这有点奇怪吗？"

Kensuke was in one of his conspiracy moods, he had been since Shinji had asked them to help with Leliel and what a load of good that turned out to be. Every day Kensuke had come up with different theories or gotten slightly more paranoid with nearly everything he saw.  
健介又陷入了他的阴谋论情绪中，自从真嗣请求他们帮助对付 Leliel 以来，他就一直是这样，结果证明那真是一团糟。每天健介都会提出不同的理论，或者对几乎所有他看到的东西变得更加偏执。

"Why would I think it's strange?"  
"我为什么要觉得奇怪呢？"

"Well it's been parked there for a few hours that's all and I'm sure I saw it there last night as well."  
"嗯，它停在那儿已经好几个小时了，而且我确信昨晚也看到它在那儿。"

"Is there anyone inside the car?"  
"车里有人吗？"

Kensuke looked out the window again trying to see if there was anyone inside the car. He couldn't see in clearly. "I don't know, I can't see anyone."  
健介再次望向窗外，试图看清车内是否有人。他看不清楚。“我不知道，我看不到任何人。”

"Well maybe they live there then. Kensuke you need to stop being so paranoid man, you've been worrying about every little thing since Shinji got back."  
"嗯，也许他们就住在那里。健介，你得停止这么多疑，自从真嗣回来后，你一直对每件小事都忧心忡忡。"

"Well don't you find it a bit strange that nothing has happened?"  
"你不觉得什么都没发生有点奇怪吗？"

"Like what? The only thing I find strange is that Shinji has spent time with the red devil since he got back. If I was him I would have told her where to go even if she did 'rescue' him."  
"比如什么？我觉得唯一奇怪的是真嗣回来后居然还和那个红发恶魔相处。如果我是他，就算她‘救’了他，我也会让她滚蛋。"

"Well there is that, but you know what I mean. We know things we shouldn't, we know about the angels now we nearly encountered one and then there was that alien ship we saw. They're going to be watching us I'm telling you."  
"嗯，是有那么回事，但你懂我的意思。我们知道了一些不该知道的事，现在我们知道了天使，还差点遇到一个，还有那艘外星飞船。我跟你说，他们肯定会监视我们的。"

"So what do you propose we do then?"  
"那你有什么建议吗？"

"Well if they _are_ watching us we can't let them know we know, so we should act as we would normally."  
"如果他们真的在监视我们，我们就不能让他们知道我们知道，所以我们应该表现得像平常一样。"

Touji grinned slightly, normal for Kensuke was pretty much how he was acting now, "Is this your definition of normal or a normal person's definition?"  
"“阿薰微微一笑，对于健介来说，他现在的行为已经算是相当正常了，‘这是你定义的正常，还是普通人眼中的正常？’”

"Very funny Touji, you know what I mean by normal. We can't let them latch on."  
“非常搞笑，阿薰，你知道我说的正常是什么意思。我们不能让他们盯上。”

"Well in that case come away from the window, if they are watching us they're going to know by you sticking your head out there. Besides you're scaring all the people that go past."  
“好吧，既然如此，那就离开窗户边，如果他们在监视我们，你这样探头出去他们肯定会发现的。再说，你把路过的人都吓坏了。”

**Stooges Apartment Exterior. – 1425 hours  
小丑公寓外景。——14 时 25 分**

Kaji kept his eyes on the window, he smiled slightly when he saw the figure move away from it and turned to Misato, "He's finally stopped looking out the window, you know don't take this the wrong way but Shinji's friend Kensuke is an…"  
加治一直盯着窗户，当他看到人影从窗边离开并转向美里时，他微微一笑，“他终于不再望向窗外了，你知道，别误会，但真嗣的朋友健介是个……”

Misato finished his sentence for him, she too was smiling "Idiot?"  
美里替他说完了这句话，她也笑着说：“白痴？”

He nodded "Yes…" 他点头道：“是的……”

"They're good lads, Kensukes just a bit…unusual. It's sort of ironic though, as weird as those two are, and how others perceive them, calling them idiots and paranoid's for their beliefs about aliens and government conspiracies, they are right."  
“他们都是好小伙，只是健介有点……与众不同。不过挺讽刺的，尽管这两人如此古怪，别人怎么看他们，说他们是傻瓜、偏执狂，因为他们关于外星人和政府阴谋的信仰，但他们是对的。”

"Funny that." “真有意思。”

She turned serious for a moment, "Did he discover us?"  
她神情严肃了一瞬，“他发现我们了吗？”

Kaji shook his head, "No he was looking at the blue car opposite the apartment block."  
加持摇摇头，“不，他当时正盯着公寓楼对面的蓝色汽车。”

"Doesn't that belong to the family that lives in one of the apartments?"  
“那不是住在某个公寓里的那家人的车吗？”

"Yup." "嗯哼。"

She thought for a moment surprised at that, surely Kensuke of all people would have looked for a black Mercedes. After all it was the stereotype for government vehicles in all good Science Fiction shows. Even she knew that since, while Shinji'd grown up, she's watched a lot of science fiction shows with him.  
她愣了一下，觉得这很奇怪，毕竟按理说，像健介这样的人应该会寻找一辆黑色奔驰。毕竟在所有好看的科幻剧中，政府车辆都是这种刻板印象。就连她自己，在陪伴真嗣成长的过程中，也和他一起看了很多科幻剧，对此有所了解。

"Oh well, doesn't he know that NERV Agents only observe in black cars like this one?"  
“哦，难道他不知道 NERV 特工只会用这种黑色车辆进行监视吗？”

"Apparently not." “显然不知道。”

She laughed again then yawned, they had only been there for an hour and she was already beginning to grow tired of it. She hated tasks like this, much preferring to be out working in the field like Shinji and Asuka got to, still at least it beat doing paperwork and she was glad she had Kaji beside her.  
她再次笑了起来，然后打了个哈欠，他们才来了一个小时，她已经开始感到厌倦了。她讨厌这样的任务，更愿意像真嗣和明日香那样在田野里工作，不过至少这比处理文书工作要好，而且她很高兴有加持在身边。

She kept on telling herself she was an idiot for letting him near her, for letting him back into her life so easily. At the same time she was telling herself that throwing him out all those years ago was one of the biggest mistakes she had ever made. The truth was she needed him to be there, to help her, to make her feel like she was worth something. It wasn't about the fact she could get his help at work or that he knew about the conspiracy. None of that mattered, he made her feel like she was worth something. He made her feel like she truly existed, it was a feeling she didn't even get when she became Shinji's guardian.  
她不断告诉自己，让他接近自己是愚蠢的，让他如此轻易地回到她的生活中是错误的。同时，她也在告诉自己，多年前把他赶出去是她犯过的最大错误之一。事实是，她需要他在那里，帮助她，让她觉得自己有价值。这并不是因为他能在工作中帮助她，或者他了解那个阴谋。这些都不重要，他让她觉得自己有价值。他让她感觉到自己真正存在，这种感觉在她成为真嗣的监护人时都没有过。

She needed to feel that at that moment, so much was happening. Shinji had chosen to stay with Asuka since he returned. It had only been two days but he had already taken some of his stuff there, Misato was happy for them, she told herself. Asuka may have said some bad things about Shinji when he was missing, but her actions outweighed that. In some ways though Misato felt Asuka was right about Shinji, he did act recklessly, going after Leliel on his own and, although she didn't think he deserved it, there was a part of her that wanted to hit him for being such an idiot.  
她需要感受到那一刻有太多事情正在发生。真嗣自归来后便选择留在明日香身边。虽然仅过了两天，但他已将一些物品搬了过去，美里为他们感到高兴，她这样告诉自己。尽管明日香在真嗣失踪时说了些关于他的坏话，但她的行动胜过了言语。然而，在某种程度上，美里觉得明日香对真嗣的看法没错，他的确行事鲁莽，独自追击雷利尔就是例证。尽管她不认为他应受此对待，但内心深处却有一股冲动想因他的愚蠢而揍他一顿。

Finally there were the Angels. There was no emotion for her to feel about this. Only numbness, what else was there to feel when you learn everything you have done has been for nothing? Or everything you have done has been guided and constructed by a higher force and, no matter what you do it'll end at the same conclusion? She couldn't even react to it, Shinji had told her about it. About the planned invasion, about what Leliel had shown them and that it was unavoidable. Misato was numb to it, she didn't want to be but she was. She wanted to cry out, to hit something but all she did was sit as they spoke about it all coming to the same conclusion, that they would try their best to change it somehow. That was when she needed Kaji, there were no words exchanged between them just an instant understanding.  
最终，还有那些使徒。对此，她没有任何情感可言，只有麻木。当你得知你所做的一切都毫无意义时，还能有什么感觉？或者你所做的一切都是被更高力量引导和构建的，无论你做什么，结果都会是一样的？她甚至无法对此做出反应，真嗣已经告诉了她这一切。关于计划的入侵，关于雷里尔向他们展示的东西，以及这是不可避免的。美里对此感到麻木，她不想这样，但她确实如此。她想大声呼喊，想打些什么，但她只是坐着，听他们谈论这一切都将走向同一个结论，他们会尽力以某种方式改变它。那时她需要加持，他们之间没有言语交流，只有瞬间的理解。

Her tone changed, "Kaji, why are we doing this?"  
她的语气变了，“加持，我们为什么要这样做？”

"Doing what?" “做什么？”

"Watching Shinji's friend's place. Leliel is dead and we've received no other indication that they could be in danger. It just seems a bit out of the blue that's all."  
"在看守真嗣朋友的地方。雷利尔已经死了，我们也没有收到其他他们可能处于危险的迹象。只是这一切来得有点突然，仅此而已。"

"There was…an incident last night. A new angel arrived."  
"昨晚……发生了一起事件。一个新的使徒出现了。"

"A new angel? You mean you knew about this but didn't tell me? Or Shinji or Asuka? they're the ones who are supposed to be hunting these so called Angels."  
"一个新的使徒？你是说你早就知道这件事，却没有告诉我？或者没有告诉真嗣和明日香？他们才是应该去狩猎这些所谓的使徒的人。"

"It's slightly more complicated than that, I have to choose my words carefully Katsuragi. I can't tell you everything I know as soon as I get it. If I did I'd be killed."  
"事情比那稍微复杂些，我得谨慎选择言辞，Katsuragi。我不能一得到信息就全盘托出。如果我那样做，我会被杀的。"

Misato was ready to retaliate. She had the words on the tip of her tongue but stopped herself when she heard his last words. He would be killed if he revealed everything, could it have been true? Or was it just another lie, another fabrication to stop her from prying further into it.  
美里准备反驳。她的话已经到了嘴边，但听到他最后的话时，她停住了。如果他透露一切，他就会被杀，这可能是真的吗？还是这只是另一个谎言，另一个阻止她进一步探究的捏造之词。

"Then what can you tell me, what does this angel have to do with Shinji's friend Kaji?"  
"那你又能告诉我什么，这个天使和真嗣的朋友加持有什么关系？"

"This Angel, it isn't like the others."  
"这个天使，和其他的不一样。"

"That doesn't make any sense, none of the Angels have been like the others."  
"这说不通，所有的天使都不一样。"

"That's correct but at the same time it's incorrect. Look what are the Angels? What do you understand them to be?"  
"对，但也不对。你看，天使是什么？你对他们有什么理解？"

"They're genetically altered humans, altered using alien DNA in a government experiment to produce super soldiers."  
"他们是基因改造的人类，通过政府实验使用外星 DNA 改造，以生产超级士兵。"

Kaji nodded, "Right which means all the Angels were once human."  
加持点头，"对，这意味着所有的使徒曾经都是人类。"

"That's what you told me and it's what seems to have been confirmed by Shinji and Asuka's investigation."  
"这就是你告诉我的，而且似乎已经被真嗣和明日香的调查所证实。"

"Right well there was one Angel, its name is Bardiel and it isn't human. It never has been"  
"确实有一个天使，它的名字是巴迪尔，而且它不是人类。它从未是过。"

She shot him a confused glance, "You mean it's one of the aliens?"  
她困惑地看了他一眼，"你是说它是外星人之一？"

"No," Kai shook his head. "It was created as a part of the Angel project, as a special side project if you will. A late addition to the project and probably the biggest mistake they made."  
"不，"凯摇了摇头。"它是作为天使计划的一部分被创造出来的，可以说是特别的一个分支项目。这个项目的后期添加，也可能是他们犯下的最大错误。"

Again Misato remained confused, "If this is their biggest mistake then why haven't they done something about it until now?"  
米萨托再次感到困惑，“如果这是他们最大的错误，那为什么他们到现在还没采取行动？”

"Arrogance it seems. They wouldn't admit it was a mistake and waited until someone else would handle the task, in this case the Evangelions."  
“似乎是傲慢。他们不愿承认这是个错误，一直等到别人来处理这件事，在这里就是指使徒。”

She sighed, "Shinji you mean."  
她叹了口气，“你是说真嗣吧。”

"Along with Ayanami and Sohryu, those three stand between the Angels and humanity's destruction."  
与绫波和惣流并肩，这三人屹立于使徒与人类毁灭之间。

Misato frowned, she already knew what would happen. Shinji had already told her, Asuka had backed up his story and Kaji had been there to listen to it and confirm it.  
美里皱起眉头，她已经预料到会发生什么。真嗣早已告诉了她，明日香证实了他的叙述，而加持也在场聆听了这一切并予以确认。

'_Of course if they succeed in defeating the Angels, SEELE will initialize the human instrumentality project and just hand us over to the aliens.'_  
“当然，如果他们成功击败使徒，SEELE 将启动人类补完计划，直接将我们交给外星人。”

There was still something she didn't understand though. What would happen if the angels won? The initial impression she got is that it would be bad but no one had said how bad. Even then though SEELE had the power to contact the aliens, why couldn't they initialize the project when they wanted instead of having to destroy the Angels?  
尽管如此，她仍有一些事情未能理解。如果使徒获胜会发生什么？她最初的印象是那会很糟糕，但没人说过会有多糟糕。即便如此，SEELE 既然有能力联系外星人，为何不能在他们想要的时候启动项目，而非得摧毁使徒呢？

"Kaji, why are we fighting the Angels?"  
“加持，我们为什么要与使徒战斗？”

"I don't follow you?" “我不明白你的意思？”

"SEELE are the ones who want us to fight and kill the angels so they can initialize the project, but we keep on killing the Angels. What will happen if they win? Why do they want Adams DNA so much, is it related to the impact incident?"  
"SEELE 是那些希望我们战斗并消灭使徒，以便他们能启动计划的人，但我们一直在消灭使徒。如果他们赢了会怎样？为什么他们如此渴望亚当的 DNA，这与冲击事件有关吗？"

"I don't know, I haven't questioned it before. All I do know is that if an Angel comes into contact with Adam in any form it will have a catastrophic effect on a wider scale than the impact incident. We don't have any choice in what we do Misato."  
"我不知道，我以前从未质疑过。我只知道，如果一个使徒以任何形式接触到亚当，其后果将比冲击事件更为灾难性。我们别无选择，美里。"

"I know but…I just wish we could do something. I don't want to believe that there's nothing we can do it's just…"  
"我知道，但是……我只是希望我们能做些什么。我不想相信我们无能为力，只是……"

He leaned across and kissed her, she kissed him back and felt his hand moving round to her jacket. She looked at him oddly but kept the kiss going, he pulled away and whispered. "We can do something, there are others like us. They're trying to find a way to stop it. They just need time, and for people to believe in them."  
他倾身过去吻了她，她也回吻着他，感觉到他的手绕到她的夹克后面。她奇怪地看着他，但继续吻着，他抽身离开，低声说道：“我们可以做些什么，还有其他人像我们一样。他们正试图找到阻止它的方法。他们只需要时间，以及人们相信他们。”

"I want to believe, but I just…"  
“我想相信，但我只是……”

**NERV Offices – 2030 hours  
NERV 办公室 – 晚上 20:30**

Shinji quickly moved towards the door, wondering just why he had been called there. Asuka had told him it was urgent but when he'd asked for more information she'd just hung up. That wasn't like her, the only thing it could have meant is that she was in some sort of trouble, but at NERV what could happen?  
真嗣迅速向门口走去，心中疑惑为何会被叫到这里。明日香告诉他事情紧急，但当他追问更多信息时，她却直接挂了电话。这不像她，唯一可能的解释是她遇到了某种麻烦，但在 NERV 能发生什么呢？

He opened the door to the office and stepped inside only to have Asuka greet him, blocking his view of the rest of the room. There was a panicked expression on her face yet almost as if she didn't want Shinji to see what was there. Shinji looked behind her and saw the others in the room, Ayanami, Ritsuko and him. Now Shinji understood that was what Asuka didn't want him to see. Shinji blinked, trying to make sure it wasn't some sort of illusion, it wasn't. He spoke not even attempting to hide his distaste. "You…"  
他推开办公室的门，踏入其中，却只见明日香迎面而来，挡住了他看向房间其他部分的视线。她脸上带着惊慌的表情，仿佛不想让真嗣看到什么。真嗣越过她望去，看到了房间里的其他人，绫波、律子和他自己。现在真嗣明白了，这就是明日香不想让他看到的。真嗣眨了眨眼，试图确认这不是某种幻觉，确实不是。他开口说话，毫不掩饰自己的厌恶。"你…"

Shinji almost couldn't believe it, standing only a couple of meters in front of him was the man responsible for this. The same man who had controlled him from the beginning, the man who had abandoned him, his own father, Gendo Ikari. Shinji felt Asuka grab hold of him almost as if she was trying to restrain him, or catch him if he fainted. Shinji wasn't sure what he wanted to do, whether he should run over and punch the man, shout at him for some sort of explanation or collapse. His legs seemed to be opting for the latter option at this moment in time.  
真嗣几乎不敢相信自己的眼睛，站在他面前仅几米远的男人，正是这一切的始作俑者。从一开始就操控着他，随后又抛弃了他的那个人，他的亲生父亲，碇源堂。真嗣感觉到明日香紧紧抓住了他，仿佛在试图阻止他，或是防止他昏倒。真嗣不确定自己想做什么，是冲过去揍那个男人一顿，还是对他大喊大叫索要一个解释，亦或是直接崩溃。此刻，他的双腿似乎倾向于选择最后一种选项。

Gendo stood still, his eyes fixed on the two Agents in front of him and his demeanor the same as always. "Shinji…"  
碇源堂静静地站着，目光紧盯着面前的两位特工，神情一如既往地冷漠。“真嗣……”

Shinji tried to find some words, anything to say. He opened his mouth to speak but nothing came out. Asuka spoke for him. "What are you doing here?"  
真嗣试图找到一些话，任何可以说出口的话。他张开嘴想要说话，却什么也没说出来。明日香替他说了。“你在这里做什么？”

"The Angel has made its presence known."  
“使徒已经显露了它的存在。”

Again Asuka spoke for Shinji she almost seemed to be channeling his rage, "That doesn't explain anything, if there's an Angel you could have done what you always do and just handed us down some stupid tip off, why are you here?"  
这次又是明日香替真嗣发声，她几乎像是在传达他的愤怒，“这根本解释不了什么，如果有使徒，你完全可以像往常一样给我们丢下些愚蠢的提示，为什么要亲自来？”

He spoke his voice stern towards the redhead, "Don't forget who I am, Sohryu. I am your superior. Do not question my decisions."  
他语气严厉地对红发女孩说，“别忘了我是谁，惣流。我是你的上级。不要质疑我的决定。”

This time Shinji did manage to find the words to say and was able to speak, "She's right, what the hell are you doing here? Is this just another of your ploys, you make yourself known and then disappear again? Or is it something else, why is this so important that you need to make yourself known?"  
这一次，真嗣终于设法找到了要说的话，并能够开口道：“她说得对，你到底在这里做什么？这只是你的另一个诡计吗，你让自己为人所知，然后又再次消失？还是别的什么原因，为什么这件事如此重要，以至于你需要让自己为人所知？”

"Because there is no one else here capable of leading this mission."  
“因为这里没有其他人有能力领导这次任务。”

Shinji snapped back, his voice raised, "There's no one else capable, what about Katsuragi? She's more than capable, more so than you, at least she won't abandon people."  
真嗣厉声反驳，声音提高了几分：“没有其他人有能力，那葛城呢？她完全有能力，比你更有能力，至少她不会抛弃人。”

"Katsuragi has already engaged the Angel and failed, she is incapable of leading this. You can always of course give up and turn away if you do not want to do this."  
"Katsuragi 已经与天使交战并失败了，她无法领导这次行动。当然，如果你不想参与，你随时可以选择放弃并转身离开。"

"I don't believe you, why would she have engaged it. She knows what they are, you're lying."  
"我不相信你，她为什么会去接触它。她知道它们是什么，你在撒谎。"

"So you choose not to believe me, that is a shame. I would however advise you consult your fellow Agents before accusing me of such things, you might be surprised."  
"所以你选择不相信我，这很遗憾。不过，我建议你在指控我之前先咨询一下你的同事们，你可能会感到惊讶。"

Shinji was about to reply back when he felt Asuka pushing him out of the room, she closed the door behind her and looked at him, a mix between concern and anger on her face.  
真嗣正要回话，却感到明日香把他推出房间，她关上门，看着他，脸上混杂着关切和愤怒。

"He's telling the truth, Misato…the Angel, you were right it's a parasite but it has an agenda. It wants revenge on us for killing its brethren. Your father was at the first crime scene last night and he found a phone number the Angel had. The Angel's current victim, he had Kaji and Misato watching them all day."  
“他说的是真的，美里……那个使徒，你说得对，它是寄生生物，但它有自己的计划。它想为被我们杀死的同类复仇。你父亲昨晚出现在第一现场，他找到了使徒留下的电话号码。使徒的当前目标，他让加持和美里全天监视他们。”

"I don't care what he told you, he's lying to us Asuka."  
“我不管他跟你说了什么，他在对我们撒谎，明日香。”

"No he's not, we had a call from Misato she said she was in trouble and she gave us the location and the name of the person Bardiel infected."  
"不，我们接到美里小姐的电话，她说她遇到了麻烦，并给了我们地点和被巴迪尔感染者的名字。"

"Is she alright? Who was the victim?"  
"她还好吗？受害者是谁？"

"She said she was alright for now but look the victim…"  
"她说目前还好，但看看受害者……"

"What about him?" "他呢？"

"It's your friend…Touji Suzahara."  
"那是你的朋友……铃原东治。"

**Abandoned Factory - 2100 废弃工厂 - 21:00**

Both cars pulled up out side the factory, both Shinji and Asuka got out of theirs, quickly followed by Gendo, Ritsuko and Ayanami. From inside they could hear the sound of gunfire, Shinji withdrew his own gun and was about to run into the factory when Ritsuko stopped him.  
两辆车在工厂外停下，真嗣和明日香分别从自己的车里出来，紧随其后的是源堂、律子和绫波。从里面传来了枪声，真嗣拔出自己的枪，正要冲进工厂时被律子拦住了。

"Wait, don't go in just yet."  
“等等，先别进去。”

Shinji shouted back at her, "Why not, Misato and Touji are in there, I can't just sit back and let them die."  
真嗣回头对她喊道：“为什么，美里和冬二在里面，我不能就这样坐视他们死去。”

The air around them was heavy with the smell of smoke, a quick glance at the factory explained the source. Part of it had gone up in flames, presumably from the gun fight between Misato and Bardiel. There was a loud smash as one of the windows on the ground floor suddenly smashed as someone was sent flying through it. Ritsuko and Shinji quickly ran over towards the body to find it was Misato who had been sent flying through it.  
四周的空气中弥漫着浓重的烟味，匆匆一瞥工厂便明了了来源。部分厂房已被火焰吞噬，想必是美里与巴迪尔之间枪战的后果。一声巨响，一楼的一扇窗户突然破碎，有人被猛地击飞穿过窗户。律子和真嗣迅速跑向那具身体，发现是美里被击飞了出来。

"She's unconscious." Ritsuko raised Misato's arm and glanced over it, "There's no signs of infection from the parasite though."  
“她昏迷了。”律子抬起美里的手臂，仔细检查，“不过没有寄生虫感染的迹象。”

Shinji looked up to see what had caused this, the sight of it made everything suddenly slow down. There he was, only he couldn't be called a person anymore but Shinji could still see the traces of him underneath. The angel, Bardiel had completely infected Touji, mutated him. The thick black liquid covered most of the body and had transformed it into a grotesque form, yet Shinji could still see traces of humanity, no matter how small they were. How could he go in there, how could he kill his own friend, it wasn't an Angel it was Touji. Touji wasn't even a part of this, he was innocent why did he have to be brought into it like this.  
真嗣抬头望向造成这一切的原因，眼前的景象让一切都突然慢了下来。那身影，虽然已不能称之为人，但真嗣仍能看出他曾经的痕迹。天使巴迪尔完全感染了冬二，将他变异。厚重的黑色液体覆盖了大部分身体，将其扭曲成一种怪诞的形态，然而真嗣仍能看到其中微弱的人性痕迹。他该如何进入那里，如何杀死自己的朋友，那不是天使，那是冬二。冬二甚至与这一切无关，他是无辜的，为何要被卷入其中。

He stepped back feeling his hand throw his gun to the floor, he uttered meekly.  
他后退一步，感觉到自己的手将枪扔到了地上，怯懦地喃喃道。

"I…I can't do this." “我……我做不到。”

No one was there to hear him, he watched on frozen to the spot as Bardiel made his way out of the factory. He watched on as Ritsuko attempted to get Misato to a safe place and his father shouted orders to him, Ayanami and Asuka. He couldn't hear the orders though, all he could hear was the sound of the creature roaring and screaming out, screams of pain as the host warred with the parasite infecting it.  
没有人听到他的话，他僵在原地，眼睁睁看着巴迪尔离开工厂。他看着丽津子试图将美里带到安全的地方，而他的父亲向他、绫波和明日香大声下达命令。但他听不见那些命令，他只能听到那怪物的咆哮和尖叫，那是宿主与寄生虫之间痛苦斗争的嘶吼。

From the corner of his eye he saw Asuka and Rei moving past him, Asuka stopped to shout something at him but he couldn't hear anything. Then everything returned to normal again, all the sound was there, his focus returned. He still couldn't move unsure of what to do, both Ayanami and Asuka brought out their handguns and fired at Bardiel. Asuka hesitating at first, after each shot she looked at Shinji.  
从眼角余光中，他瞥见明日香和绫波经过他身边，明日香停下脚步朝他大喊些什么，但他什么也听不见。随后一切恢复正常，声音回来了，他的注意力也恢复了。他仍然无法动弹，不确定该做什么，绫波和明日香都掏出手枪向巴迪尔射击。明日香起初犹豫了一下，每开一枪后都看向真嗣。

None of the shots mattered though, each one was blocked by the Angel's A.T. Field, Rei ran forward towards it, only to have her self thrown back by its A.T. Field. She landed with a sickening thud on the ground and screamed out in pain only to get up immediately and try to dash towards Bardiel again. This time there was no A.T. Field, instead Bardiel raised one of its arms towards her and grabbed her by the throat, the black liquid acting as an extension to the arm.  
然而，这些射击都无关紧要，每一枪都被使徒的 A.T.力场挡下，绫波冲向它，却被其 A.T.力场弹回。她重重地摔在地上，发出令人作呕的撞击声，痛苦地尖叫起来，随即立刻起身再次试图冲向巴迪尔。这次没有 A.T.力场，取而代之的是巴迪尔抬起一只手臂，掐住她的喉咙，黑色的液体作为手臂的延伸。

It effortlessly threw Rei back like an albino rag doll, dashing her limp body against a concrete wall. This time she didn't get up, this time it was serious. Shinji felt himself moving towards her. He knelt down beside her and looked at her, she was wounded badly. Blood was pouring from a wound on her head and she was bleeding from the mouth. Again he looked up towards Bardiel, this time Asuka tried to engage it. It held her up this time choking the life out of her and turned to look directly at Shinji. It didn't speak, it didn't growl or scream, it just looked at him through those burning hate filled eyes. Those eyes that had once belonged to his best friend, it taunted him using his friends. It was forcing him to do those things, forcing him to choke and kill Asuka. Yet Shinji felt himself unable to do anything but watch.  
它轻松地将丽像一只白化病布娃娃般抛回，将她瘫软的身体猛撞在混凝土墙上。这一次，她没有再站起来，这一次情况严重了。真嗣感到自己正朝她走去。他跪在她身边，看着她，她伤得很重。鲜血从她头上的伤口涌出，嘴里也在流血。他再次抬头望向巴迪尔，这次是明日香试图与之交战。它这次将她举起，掐住她的生命，并转头直视真嗣。它没有说话，没有咆哮或尖叫，只是透过那双充满仇恨的燃烧眼睛看着他。那双曾经属于他最好朋友的眼睛，用他的朋友来嘲弄他。它强迫他做那些事，强迫他掐死明日香。然而，真嗣感到自己除了观看之外什么也做不了。

"What are you waiting for Shinji?"  
“你在等什么，真嗣？”

He felt his father's eyes burning into the back of his skull as he spoke back weakly, "I…I can't do it, I won't fight it…I can't."  
他感到父亲的目光如火般灼烧着他的后脑勺，他虚弱地回应道：“我……我做不到，我不会与它对抗……我不能。”

"You have to fight it, if you don't we will all be destroyed."  
"你必须与之战斗，否则我们都会被毁灭。"

"I can't…he's…its Touji…my friend."  
"我做不到……他是……那是我的朋友，真嗣。"

"That's not your friend anymore, it's an Angel. Defeat it."  
"那已经不是你的朋友了，它是使徒。必须击败它。"

"No I can't." “不，我做不到。”

He heard Asuka land next to him with the same sickening thud Rei had, he turned around to look at her. Her entire throat was bruised and she was coughing up blood, he then saw Bardiel coming towards him. This was it, he couldn't fight back this was the end, even if he wanted to his body wouldn't let him.  
他听到明日香落在他身边，发出与丽相同的令人作呕的撞击声，他转过身去看她。她的整个喉咙都瘀伤了，正在咳血，然后他看到了巴迪尔向他走来。就是这样，他无法反击，这是终结，即使他想，他的身体也不允许。

His father shouted toward him again, "Shinji what are you waiting for? Fight it! That's your purpose Agent, to defeat the Angels."  
他的父亲再次向他喊道：“真嗣，你在等什么？战斗！这就是你的使命，特工，击败使徒。”

It was too late Bardiel was already next to him, Shinji stood up and let Bardiel punch him, sending him flying back. He staggered for a bit before crumpling in a heap in front of Gendo and Ritsuko.  
为时已晚，巴迪尔已经站在他身边，真嗣起身任由巴迪尔一拳将他击飞。他踉跄了几步，最终在碇源堂和律子面前瘫倒成一团。

Gendo turned and whispered to Ritsuko, Shinji lay still not wanting to get up then he felt Ritsuko hovering over him. He felt her kneel down and inject something into to the back of his neck and then she apologized to him. He wondered what she was apologizing for and then everything faded a bit. Something was happening to him.  
碇源堂转身对律子低语，真嗣躺在地上不愿起身，随后他感觉到律子在他上方徘徊。他感到她跪下并往他后颈注射了什么，然后她向他道歉。他疑惑她为何道歉，接着一切变得有些模糊。有什么事情正在他身上发生。

He felt something inside him, something building up, almost as if there were two people inside him. One of which was him Shinji Ikari the person the other was something else, he was aware of this other more dominant presence as he stood up. He turned towards Bardiel and felt something inside him, rage building up at the Angel the entity which had took control of his friend. Soon that other part of him, the original Shinji Ikari was gone, in a white hot flash he felt himself running towards Bardiel.  
他感到体内有什么东西，仿佛有两个灵魂共存其中。一个是他，真嗣·碇，另一个则是某种未知的存在。他意识到这个更强势的意识随着他站起身来。他转向巴迪尔，内心涌起对这位天使——那个控制了他朋友的存在的愤怒。很快，那个原本的真嗣·碇消失了，在一阵炽热的闪光中，他感到自己正冲向巴迪尔。

He didn't want to be doing this, he knew he didn't but it didn't stop him, there was nothing around him anymore except for him and the Angel. This wasn't him, it was the serum inside him, it was what his father had made him. He paused for a moment trying to fight against it but it was useless, he wanted to destroy it he forced his arm to rise up, forced his fist to fly towards Bardiel and sent it staggering back.  
他并不想这么做，他知道他不想，但这并没有阻止他，周围的一切都不复存在，只剩下他和那个天使。这不是他，是体内的血清在作祟，是他的父亲造就了他这样。他停顿了一下试图反抗，但无济于事，他想要摧毁它，他强迫自己的手臂抬起，强迫拳头向巴迪尔飞去，将其击退。

Bardiel fought back, it wrapped one of its long black tentacle-like arms around his throat. It increased its grip, Shinji could feel it choking him. He raised one of his own hands and reached towards the Angels throat and began squeezing tightly. Bardiel released Shinji's body and he felt it drop to the floor with a thud, he still had no control over it. He could feel everything, the pain from landing, the pain from being choked, yet he could do nothing about it.  
巴迪尔反击了，它用一条长长的黑色触手般的手臂缠住了他的脖子。它加大了力道，真嗣能感觉到它在窒息他。他举起自己的一只手，伸向天使的喉咙，开始紧紧挤压。巴迪尔放开了真嗣的身体，他感觉到它砰的一声摔在地上，他仍然无法控制自己。他能感受到一切，着陆的疼痛，窒息的痛苦，然而他却无能为力。

Shinji felt his body lunge again towards Bardiel, it picked it up and delivered a blow to the stomach and quickly followed up with a knee dropping Bardiel to its knees. He felt his hand draw back and then swiftly move forwards again, delivering a sickening blow to the face of Bardiel. Again and again he kept on delivering punches, he didn't care where. The stomach, the face, the throat, everywhere was a target for him, just as long as he destroyed whatever it was that had taken over Touji.  
真嗣感到自己的身体再次向巴迪尔扑去，它将其举起并猛击腹部，紧接着一记膝击让巴迪尔跪倒在地。他感到自己的手向后一缩，然后迅速向前挥出，狠狠地打在巴迪尔的脸上。一次又一次，他不停地挥拳，不在乎打在哪里。腹部、脸部、喉咙，每一个部位都是他的目标，只要能摧毁那个占据冬二的东西。

In the back of his mind he could feel his own consciousness shouting back at him, _"No please, please stop this. Please stop this."_  
在他的意识深处，他感觉到自己的理智在向他呼喊，“不，请不要，请停下来。请停下来。”

Shinji felt his body stand up, was that it? Maybe it was over, maybe the torture was over maybe Bardiel was finally defeated. He could feel the rage subside, the movement in his body, it was his again. Whatever had been injected into him was wearing off, he looked at his own hands on horror. There was blood trickling down them, it wasn't his own blood but the blood of the Angel, of his friend. He moved away from the body, that was if he had killed, if there was nothing more. He whimpered slightly, his voice building up as he shouted towards his father.  
真嗣感到自己的身体站了起来，就这样结束了吗？也许一切都结束了，也许折磨已经停止，也许巴迪尔终于被击败了。他感觉到愤怒逐渐消退，身体的控制权又回到了自己手中。注入他体内的东西正在消退，他惊恐地看着自己的双手。鲜血正顺着它们流淌，那不是他自己的血，而是天使的，是他朋友的血。他远离了那具躯体，如果他已经杀死了它，如果再也没有什么了。他微微呜咽着，声音逐渐增强，向他的父亲喊道。

"What…What have I done…What did you make me do father…"  
"我……我做了什么……你让我做了什么，父亲……"

Gendo's reply came it was unsympathetic and cold, "It had to be done Shinji, you know that."  
碇源堂的回答冷漠无情，“这是必须做的，真嗣，你知道的。”

"Not like this it didn't, we could have found a better way. An easier way…we didn't…I didn't…"  
"不是这样的，我们可以找到更好的办法。更简单的方法……我们没有……我没有……"

Shinji felt one of Bardiel's hands reach up and grab his own, the one that was holding and aiming the gun. Slowly the Angel began to speak, only it wasn't Bardiel it was Touji.  
真嗣感觉到巴迪尔的一只手伸上来抓住了他的手，正是握着并瞄准枪的那只。慢慢地，天使开始说话，但那声音不是巴迪尔，而是冬二。

"Shinji…it wasn't…your fault…"  
"真嗣……那不是……你的错……"

"Touji, I…" "冬二，我……"

"It's dying Shinji, please you need to finish the job. If you don't it'll regenerate…"  
"真嗣，它快死了，请你完成这个任务。如果你不这么做，它会再生的……"

"I can't…I just…" "我做不到……我只是……"

"Please, it's the only way…"  
"拜托，这是唯一的办法……"

He felt the grip on his wrist tighten as Touji guided Shinjis aim towards his heart. Shinji's mouth went dry as he closed his eyes. He couldn't do it, he had done enough, why wasn't it over yet? He felt his finger tighten, was it Eva resurfacing this time…or was it him. No it was him, he had to do this.  
他感觉到手腕上的握力加重，东治引导着真嗣的枪口对准自己的心脏。真嗣的嘴变得干燥，他闭上了眼睛。他做不到，他已经做得够多了，为什么还没结束？他感到自己的手指收紧，这次是 Eva 在复苏……还是他自己。不，是他自己，他必须这么做。

"Please Shinji…I can't live like this. It's already used my body for killing people, it needs to be stopped."  
“求你了，真嗣……我无法这样活下去。它已经利用我的身体杀了人，必须被阻止。”

"Touji, I'm…I'm sorry." “东治，我……我很抱歉。”

A loud bang echoing throughout the distance, Shinji had never known the sound of gun fire could be so loud. He dropped the handgun and staggered back, his head spinning with the thought of what he had just done. Around him he could make out shapes, figures, people, one of them was moving towards him. He couldn't make out who they were, all he could feel was them holding out there arms as he collapsed into them.  
一声巨响在远处回荡，真嗣从未想过枪声能如此震耳欲聋。他丢下手枪，踉跄后退，脑海中充斥着刚刚所做之事的念头。周围他能辨认出一些形状、身影、人影，其中一人正向他走来。他看不清他们是谁，只感觉到他们伸出双臂，而他倒在其中。

### Chapter 21 Spare Bricks

_22nd July 2015 2015 年 7 月 22 日  
_**Day One – In The Flesh  
第一天 —— 活生生的**

Fifteen years can be a short time depending on the person, for many it's hard to believe it's only been fifteen years since the impact incident and since the incident which took millions of lives and cost corporations billions. Some corporations weathered the storm easily. Global businesses, the ones with branch's across the world, they took a blow but were able to recover within the year. Others found it much harder, there were so many companies went bankrupt taking their owners and shareholders with them.  
对于某些人来说，十五年或许只是弹指一挥间，但对于许多人而言，很难相信自那场撞击事件及其引发的数百万生命消逝、企业损失数十亿的事件发生以来，仅仅过去了十五年。一些企业轻松挺过了这场风暴，那些在全球范围内拥有分支机构的大公司，虽然遭受了打击，但一年内便得以恢复。而其他企业则发现这困难重重，许多公司因此破产，连带其所有者和股东一同沉沦。

For some, however they saw the impact as an opportunity to stake a claim in the business world and to establish themselves. They just needed a way to do it, to make money from the impact yet keep a good public image. First objective of a business is to make money, and what better way to do so than to make it from the world's biggest disaster in nearly a hundred years?  
然而，对某些人来说，这场撞击却成了在商界立足并确立自身地位的契机。他们需要的只是一个方法，既能从这场灾难中获利，又能保持良好的公众形象。企业的首要目标就是盈利，而还有什么比从近百年来世界最大的灾难中赚钱更好的方式呢？

It all started simply enough, an offer to build shelters in the newly dubbed Tokyo 2 for people affected by the impact. There were no survivors from Old Tokyo, but surrounding towns and villages felt it and they were the first to be targeted. The business would offer to build shelters and help these people if the government would fund them. It succeeded, how couldn't it? The offer of cheap help, the government jumped at the opportunity, within five years the business had grown substantially and now had backing not only from the Japanese Government but the support of governments around the world and even backing by the UN.  
一切始于一个简单的提议，为受撞击影响的新命名的东京 2 区建造避难所。旧东京无一幸存者，但周边城镇和村庄感受到了冲击，它们成为首批援助对象。这家企业提出，如果政府提供资金，他们将建造避难所并帮助这些人。提议成功了，怎能不成功呢？廉价援助的承诺，政府抓住了这一机会，五年内，企业迅速壮大，不仅获得了日本政府的支持，还得到了全球各国政府乃至联合国的支持。

Soon centers were set up in other countries, the company's services no longer limited to just Japan and the impact. Across northern America centers were set up in deprived areas to help people get back on their feet. Same in Europe and Africa, thanks to the organization people all over the world were being given an opportunity. The owners were happy and profiting, its customers, the governments and UN were happy and most of all the people it served were happy.  
不久，中心在其他国家也相继建立，公司的服务不再局限于日本和撞击影响区。北美北部贫困地区、欧洲和非洲都设立了中心，帮助人们重新站起来。多亏了这个组织，世界各地的人们都获得了机会。企业主们高兴且获利，客户、政府和联合国满意，最重要的是，受助者们也感到满意。

Ten years after it was set up, it expanded. The Company was no longer limited to just giving aid to countries and the unfortunate. Thanks to the funding and public support it received, it moved into the field of medicine and biochemical research. Promising that a cure would be found for diseases previously thought incurable, the big breakthrough came when it privately tested the world's first working AIDS vaccine.  
成立十年后，它扩展了业务。公司不再局限于仅向国家和不幸者提供援助。得益于所获资金和公众支持，它进军了医药和生化研究领域。承诺将为那些曾被认为无法治愈的疾病找到治疗方法，而重大突破在于它秘密测试了世界上首个有效的艾滋病疫苗。

By the year Twenty Fifteen, the Marduk Institute is one of the world leaders in medical research. The AIDS vaccine is ready for a public testing as the New Year approaches, a promise that in the months that follow, cures for more diseases will be found. It was definitely a big promise, one that many people felt they couldn't follow through with but it was hope, something that was needed with the constant threat of another possible Impact Incident looming over them.  
到了 2015 年，马尔杜克研究所已成为全球医学研究的领军机构之一。随着新年临近，艾滋病疫苗准备公开测试，承诺在接下来的几个月里，将找到更多疾病的治疗方法。这无疑是一个宏大的承诺，许多人觉得难以兑现，但它带来了希望，在另一个可能的撞击事件不断威胁下，这种希望尤为重要。

Then there was the person leading the institute, the person who had helped lead them into the field of medical research and promised this brighter future for mankind, the man known to the public as Kaworou Nagisa. On this day he stands in the Marduk Institute headquarters main meeting rooms, only an hour after giving a speech in front of hundreds of eager reporters. The speech that will set new wheels into motion, wheels that will turn humanity towards, as he put it 'A future beyond what they could have ever imagined.'  
接着是研究所的领导者，那位引领他们进入医学研究领域并承诺为人类带来更光明未来的人，公众所熟知的卡沃鲁·渚。这一天，他站在马杜克研究所总部的会议室中，仅在一个小时前，他在数百名热切的记者面前发表了演讲。这场演讲将启动新的进程，正如他所言，引领人类走向‘一个超越他们所能想象的未来’。

Now he stands looking out over the skyline of Tokyo 3, his own pale reflection looking back at him through the windows, his white hair coming down to his shoulders, his red eyes gazing out across the great metropolis. He smiled slightly at his handiwork, with a few simple words and the promise of hope, millions around the world put their trust in him. In the background he could hear the very words he had uttered earlier being repeated on one of the new programs he had turned to just to catch the continuing news coverage of the explosion at an abandoned factory outside the city. He went over and turned the TV off, muttering quietly to himself.  
此刻，他站在东京 3 区的天际线前，透过窗户，自己的苍白倒影回望着他，白发披肩，红眸凝视着这座大都会。他对自己的杰作微微一笑，仅凭几句简单的话语和希望的承诺，全球数百万人便将信任寄托于他。在他身后，他可以听到自己早先说过的那些话，正被某个新节目反复播放，这是他特意转台以捕捉城市外废弃工厂爆炸事件的持续新闻报道。他走过去关掉了电视，低声自语。

"Bardiel, you were a fool. I gave you the opportunity, yet you did not take it. We had a willing host yet you went against us, what a waste of life you truly were."  
"巴迪尔，你真是个蠢货。我给了你机会，你却没抓住。我们有自愿的宿主，你却背叛了我们，真是生命的浪费。"

He returned to his position overlooking Tokyo 3 just as the doors to the room opened and three more people entered the room. Kaworou turned around just in time to see them fully enter the room. Smiling he observed the three of them, the first a man built slightly larger than Kaworou. He was wearing a typical business suit just like many Japanese business men wore when in this area of the city. Kaworou greeted the man and he took a seat.  
他回到俯瞰第三新东京市的位置，就在这时，房间的门打开了，又有三个人走了进来。卡瓦罗转身及时看到他们完全进入房间。他微笑着观察这三人，第一个是身材略大于卡瓦罗的男子。他穿着典型的商务西装，就像这个城市这一区域许多日本商务人士所穿的那样。卡瓦罗向男子打招呼，他便坐了下来。

Kaworou then turned to the second person and greeted her. She had the same piercing red eyes as him, however she did not share the white hair or the pale white skin. She too took a seat at the small conference table. Then he moved onto the third person, also female and remarkably identical to the woman before hand. However, instead of having long flowing brown hair she had long flowing blonde hair. She took the third seat with Kaworou taking the final seat.  
接着，卡瓦罗转向第二个人，向她打招呼。她有着和他一样锐利的红色眼睛，但她没有白发或苍白的皮肤。她也坐在了小会议桌旁。然后他转向第三个人，同样是女性，与前一位惊人地相似。不过，她的长发不是棕色而是金色的。她坐在第三个座位上，卡瓦罗则坐在最后一个座位上。

"The time has come my friends, it has been a tough road but we have been able to stick together through it. All our other brothers and sisters have fallen, choosing to seek out Adam by themselves. For this arrogance they have been taken from this earth. Perhaps too early it must be said, but their sacrifice will be our gain. We now have a possible location for Adam and with the backing of Chairman Keel and SEELE we also know the identities of those known as the Evangelion."  
"时机已至，我的朋友们，这是一条艰难的道路，但我们始终团结一心。我们的兄弟姐妹们纷纷倒下，他们选择独自寻找亚当。正是这份傲慢，让他们过早地离开了这个世界。或许这话说得过早，但他们的牺牲将为我们带来胜利。现在，我们有了亚当的可能位置，并且在基尔主席和 SEELE 的支持下，我们也知晓了那些被称为‘福音战士’的身份。"

Kaworou paused for a moment allowing the other three to take in what he had just said, their reactions did not say much of what they thought. Each of them looked on seemingly unperturbed by the news. One of them did however speak, the female with brown hair. She spoke, her voice soft sounding yet at the same time stern and to the point.  
卡洛鲁停顿了一下，让其他三人消化他刚刚说的话，他们的反应并没有透露太多内心的想法。每个人都显得无动于衷，似乎对这消息漠不关心。然而，其中一人开口了，那位棕色头发的女性。她说话了，声音柔和却同时坚定而直接。

"What can we do with the identities? They have already been able to take out our brothers and sisters, surely we should not concern ourselves with the Evangelions but instead with retrieving Adam. After all this is our object, to retrieve Adam. Involving ourselves with the Evangelions would be a bad move."  
"我们能用这些身份做什么？他们已经能够消灭我们的兄弟姐妹，我们当然不应该关注福音战士，而应该专注于找回亚当。毕竟，找回亚当才是我们的目标。与福音战士纠缠不清只会是糟糕的举动。"

"Normally I would agree with you Areal, but, it would seem however that the path to Adam leads us right through the Evangelions. We do have an advantage over them that our brethren did not."  
"通常我会同意你，Areal，但似乎通往亚当的道路正引导我们穿过那些 EVA。我们确实有一个优势，是我们的同胞所没有的。"

Areal spoke again, her voice suspicious, "What is this advantage?"  
Areal 再次开口，语气中带着怀疑，“这个优势是什么？”

"We have power and numbers, our brothers and sisters chose to act alone. Each one falling one after the other with no back up, if one fell no matter how weak the Eva's were there would be no one to capitalize. We have that advantage, we have each other and we have people ready to follow us."  
"我们有力量和数量，我们的兄弟姐妹选择单独行动。一个接一个地倒下，没有后援，如果一个倒下了，无论 EVA 多么弱小，都没有人能利用这个机会。我们有这个优势，我们互相支持，我们有愿意跟随我们的人。"

Areal replied, seemingly more confident but still doubtful, "I see, I fear this might not be enough though. We would be better off trying to secure Adam and avoiding the Evangelions altogether."  
Areal 回答道，看似更有信心但仍存疑虑，“我明白了，不过我担心这可能还不够。我们最好还是设法保护 Adam，避免与 Eva 直接接触。”

"This is impossible, there is always an Evangelion in close proximity to Adam at all times. However two of them are unaware of their proximity to Adam, this can work to our advantage."  
“这不可能，Adam 身边总是有 Eva 在附近。不过其中两台 Eva 并不知道它们离 Adam 很近，这可以为我们所用。”

One of the other Angels entered the conversation, the male. "What of the other one?"  
另一位天使加入了对话，是那位男性。“那另一个呢？”

"She is weak compared to the other two, although she may still pose a problem. If we can isolate the other two then we will be able to launch a coordinated effort to retrieve the first sample.  
"与另外两人相比，她较为脆弱，但仍可能构成威胁。如果我们能将那两人隔离开来，就能协同行动夺取第一个样本。"

"So what do you propose?"  
"那你有什么提议？"

"We cannot rush into this, we will need time. Fortunately we have it in abundance, they will still be recovering from Bardiel's attack. From my intelligence reports Unit 01, or Shinji Ikari, is in a weakened state, we will use this to our advantage to lure him away."  
"我们不能仓促行事，需要时间。幸运的是，我们有充足的时间，他们还在从巴迪尔的攻击中恢复。根据我的情报，初号机，或者说碇真嗣，正处于虚弱状态，我们将利用这一点引开他。"

"How can we lure him away?"  
"我们如何才能引他离开？"

"I've contacted Keel, he has been able to negotiate a new placement within NERV. Zureal, I want you to take the placement. Infiltrate their ranks and lead Ikari out, once there we will give him what he thinks he wants. I will offer him hope and he will receive it."  
"我已经联系了基尔，他已经成功在 NERV 内部谈妥了一个新职位。朱瑞尔，我要你接受这个职位。渗透进他们的队伍，把碇引出来，一旦成功，我们会给他他自以为想要的东西。我会给他希望，而他将得到它。"

"How can we be sure of this?"  
"我们怎么能确定这一点呢？"

"We can be sure because, despite all his ability, he is still human." Kaworou paused for a brief moment before continuing, "The position will open up in twenty eight days, until that time I will assign each of you to a target. Observe them but do not make your true selves known, we should try to keep contact down to a minimum. I want a list and detailed check list of them all when we reconvene. Areal you will handle the one known as Asuka Langley Sohryu, have your people go through her records, find out what you can about her family history and her past. Armisael I want you to learn what you can about Rei Ayanami, unfortunately she is within proximity of NERV's director a lot of the time."  
"“我们可以确信，尽管他能力出众，但终究还是人类。” Kaworou 停顿片刻后继续说道，“这个职位将在二十八天后空缺，在那之前，我会给你们每个人分配一个目标。观察他们，但不要暴露真实身份，我们应尽量减少接触。下次会议时，我要一份详细的名单和检查清单。Areal，你负责处理被称为惣流·明日香·兰格雷的那个人，让你的手下查阅她的档案，尽可能了解她的家族历史和过去。Armisael，我要你尽可能了解绫波零的情况，遗憾的是她经常在 NERV 的指挥官附近。”

Armiseal cut in at that moment, "What do you suggest?"  
Armiseal 此时插话道，“你有什么建议？”

Kaworou continued, "Instead I suggest a different approach, the doctor Ritsuko Akagi, she too is weakening. Persuade her to give you information but do not give away anything."  
Kaworou 继续说，“我建议换个方法，医生赤木律子也在逐渐衰弱。说服她提供信息，但不要透露任何东西。”

The blonde haired female nodded, acknowledging the request. Finally Kaworou turned to Zureal and spoke, "Shinji Ikari will be the hardest one, he is the Director's son and I feel there is something different about him. He will be the first one we need to isolate from the group. I will arrange something with Keel for this. As I said lure him away and I will handle the rest."  
金发女子点头应允，终于，Kaworou 转向 Zureal 说道：“碇真嗣将是最棘手的，他是司令的儿子，我感觉他有些与众不同。我们需要首先将他从团队中隔离出来。我会和 Keel 安排此事。正如我所说，引开他，其余的交给我处理。”

All three of the Angels nodded and stood from their seats, Kaworou looked on confidently. "We reconvene in twenty eight days and then we look onwards towards the New Year and the Lilim's new era."  
三位天使都点头起身，Kaworou 自信地注视着他们。“我们二十八天后再次集结，然后向新年和人类的新纪元迈进。”

**Day Three – Another Brick In The Wall  
第三天 —— 墙上的又一块砖**

Asuka looked around the hospital, seething with anger. She hated these places so much. Every time she had been injured she had treated it herself or asked to be treated at the scene, it had agitated many people but she didn't care. Yet here she was walking down the corridor of one to visit someone, not to question the person but to actually visit them. There was something about this particular hospital she didn't like though, this is where it had pretty much all began. This was the hospital where they had first saw the man they then known as Gendo Rokubungi, the man they now knew to be Shinji's father.  
明日香环顾医院，怒火中烧。她极其厌恶这些地方。每次受伤，她要么自己处理，要么要求在现场治疗，这激怒了许多人，但她不在乎。然而，她现在却走在医院的走廊上，不是去质问某人，而是去探望。尽管如此，这家医院总让她感到某种不快，因为这里几乎是一切开始的地方。正是在这家医院，他们第一次见到了那个后来被称为碇源堂的男人，也就是现在他们所知的真嗣的父亲。

No one had even explained to her why it was this hospital, Misato had been taken here, as had Shinji. Of course Shinji promptly checked himself out only to nearly collapse on the way out. Asuka remembered it well, she was walking with him at the time. She was tempted to take him back inside but she saw it in his eyes. He didn't want to go back in, his father was there. After what had just happened even Asuka knew it wasn't a good idea for them to be within close proximity.  
没有人向她解释为什么是这家医院，美里和真嗣都被送到了这里。当然，真嗣很快就办了出院手续，结果在离开的路上差点晕倒。明日香对此记忆犹新，当时她正和他一起走。她本想带他回医院，但她从他的眼神中看出来了。他不想回去，他的父亲在那里。经历了刚刚的事情，就连明日香也知道他们不宜靠得太近。

Now, however, she wasn't just angry from having to enter the place again but because of her decision of what to do with Shinji. It had been three days, with each day she found herself getting more and more annoyed with him. At first she felt sorry for him, but he wouldn't do anything, he wouldn't speak, he would barely eat, Asuka found herself going back into her old mindset, the one that saw him as nothing more as a work colleague and the mindset that saw him as an increasingly pathetic human being.  
然而，现在她不仅因为不得不再次进入这个地方而感到愤怒，还因为她对如何处理真嗣的决定。已经过去三天了，每一天她发现自己对他的恼怒都在增加。起初她对他感到同情，但他什么都不做，不说话，几乎不吃东西，明日香发现自己又回到了旧有的心态，那种只把他看作同事的心态，以及那种认为他越来越可悲的人的心态。

She turned into the corridor leading to the room where Misato was being kept just in time to see both Gendo and Rei leaving. Gendo walked straight past her, however Ayanami stopped in front of her. Asuka cursed silently not really wanting to get into a conversation with her.  
她转身走进通往美里所在房间的走廊，正好看到源堂和丽离开。源堂径直从她身边走过，然而绫波却停在了她面前。明日香暗自咒骂，实在不想和她交谈。

"Is Shinji not with you today?"  
“今天真嗣没和你在一起吗？”

Asuka looked around and replied sarcastically, "Yeah he's just invisible. No Ayanami he isn't, he's at home sleeping."  
明日香环顾四周，嘲讽地回答道：“是啊，他只是隐形了。不，绫波，他不在，他在家睡觉。”

Rei questioned her, "I am curious, what do you mean home? I thought he lived with Katsuragi."  
绫波质疑她：“我很好奇，你说的‘家’是什么意思？我以为他和葛城住在一起。”

Asuka replied, trying not to lose her temper. She didn't need reminding that Shinji was staying with her. "He does, except he's been staying with me since we retrieved him from Leliel."  
明日香回答道，尽量不发脾气。她不需要别人提醒真嗣和她住在一起。“他是和葛城住，不过自从我们从雷利尔那里把他救回来后，他就一直住在我这儿。”

"I see I am surprised you are allowing him to stay with you. I was under the impression you did not like him."  
"我看得出我很惊讶你居然允许他和你住在一起。我以为你不喜欢他。"

With each question Asuka was getting increasingly annoyed, she was already in a bad mood because of Shinji and, from before that, at being practically embarrassed by Bardiel. Rei was making her feel worse.  
随着每一个问题，明日香变得越来越恼火，她本来就因为真嗣心情不好，更早之前还因为巴迪尔的事感到尴尬。丽让她感觉更糟了。

"I don't really think that's any of your business, besides it isn't like you've done much to help him. You could have told him or me what you know but you kept it to yourself, just whose side are you on anyway?"  
"我觉得那不关你的事，再说了，你也没怎么帮他。你本可以告诉他或我你知道的事情，但你却隐瞒了，你到底站在哪一边？"

Asuka shot back angrily, knowing her final words maybe making her sound a little bit childish but she didn't particularly care. It wasn't really as if Rei was in a position to question her about such a thing anyway, considering that Rei already knew so much but failed to mention it to either her or to Shinji.  
明日香愤怒地回击，明知自己的最后一句话可能显得有些幼稚，但她并不特别在意。毕竟，绫波也没有立场来质疑她，考虑到绫波已经知道这么多却未曾向她或真嗣透露。

Asuka felt bad when she saw Rei's reaction. It looked like Asuka had actually upset the blue haired agent. Rei spoke slowly this time, it was clear she was trying to maintain her composure.  
看到绫波的反应，明日香感到有些内疚。看起来她真的让这位蓝发特工感到不快了。这次，绫波说话慢了下来，显然是在努力保持镇定。

"I am sorry for upsetting you. I hope Ikari feels better soon."  
“我很抱歉让你不高兴了。希望碇能尽快好起来。”

Rei moved quickly down the corridor to rejoin Gendo, not giving Asuka a chance to respond. She shrugged it off and went into Misato's room and found Kaji was already in there talking to her. Misato was sitting up, her arm still bandaged from the injuries she had sustained but she was looking well and had a smile on her face. Asuka went over to her and hugged her, Misato greeting her.  
丽迅速沿着走廊走向源堂，没给明日香回应的机会。她耸耸肩，不予理会，走进美里房间，发现加持已经在里面和美里交谈。美里坐起身，手臂仍缠着绷带，但看起来状态不错，面带微笑。明日香走过去拥抱她，美里向她打招呼。

"Sohryu, it's good to see you."  
“惣流，见到你真好。”

Asuka did her best to smile at her superior. "It's good to see you too, how are you feeling?"  
明日香尽力向她的上司微笑。“见到你我也很高兴，你感觉怎么样？”

"I'm feeling a lot better thank you. They just won't let me out yet. They're keeping me in for observation. The director brought me here because he feared I may have contracted something from Bardiel. Apparently the parasite could be lying dormant in me, a load of bullshit if you ask me, because I feel fine."  
"我感觉好多了，谢谢。他们就是还不让我出去。让我留在这里观察。司令带我来这儿是因为他担心我可能从巴迪尔那里感染了什么。据说那个寄生虫可能在我体内潜伏，要我说，简直是胡扯，因为我感觉一切正常。"

Asuka laughed, "Well that's the exact reason I don't like these places. Do you know when you'll be out?"  
明日香笑了，"那么，这就是我不喜欢这些地方的直接原因。你知道你什么时候能出去吗？"

"They say about a week, how is Shinji doing?"  
"他们说大概一周吧，真嗣怎么样了？"

Asuka sighed heavily, not quite sure what to tell Misato. There was no way she was going to get around explaining it to her at any rate. She knew how Misato felt about Shinji, that she felt of him as her own son and she had seen that had happened last time she had said anything bad about him. Although Asuka still felt she was right she didn't really want to get on the bad side of her superior either. Fortunately for Asuka, her silence on the subject said a lot to Misato.  
明日香重重地叹了口气，不太确定该如何向美里解释。无论如何，她知道躲不过去，必须向她说明。她清楚美里对真嗣的感情，美里把他当作自己的儿子看待，而她上次说真嗣坏话时发生的事还历历在目。尽管明日香仍觉得自己没错，但她也不想惹恼自己的上司。幸运的是，明日香对此事的沉默已经向美里传达了很多信息。

"I see, he isn't taking it well then?"  
“我明白了，他接受得不太好吗？”

Asuka sighed, "To put it bluntly, no he isn't. I thought I was doing the right thing by letting him stay with me while you were in here. I thought maybe being around someone else would have helped him a bit more but he's acting so pathetic over it."  
明日香叹了口气，“直截了当地说，是的，他接受得不好。我以为让你在这里的时候让他和我待在一起是正确的，我以为有别人在身边可能会对他有所帮助，但他表现得如此可怜。”

"How do you mean?" “你这是什么意思？”

Asuka sped up, she didn't really want to talk about this today but at the same time needed to get it off her chest. "He's not speaking and barely eating. He won't leave the house or do anything, I keep on trying to get him to speak or do something but he won't. I don't know why he's acting like this, it wasn't even his fault. It was his bastard father who forced him to do it, and even then, what else could have been done? Shinji saw what Bardiel had done to his friend, that wasn't his friend in there anymore. He did his friend a favor if anything."  
明日香加快了脚步，她今天其实并不想谈论这个话题，但又觉得必须一吐为快。“他现在几乎不说话，吃得也很少。他不愿出门，什么都不做。我一直试图让他开口或做点什么，但他就是不肯。我不知道他为什么会这样，这根本不是他的错。是他那混蛋父亲逼他这么做的，即便如此，还能有什么别的办法呢？真嗣看到了第十三使徒对朋友做了什么，那里面已经不是他的朋友了。从某种意义上说，真嗣反而是帮了他的朋友。”

They were harsh words but both Misato and Asuka knew they were true. If Bardiel hadn't been stopped he would have used Touji's body to keep going and keep killing until there was nothing left. As tragic as it was it had to be done, there was no other way. Misato knew this and understood Asuka's predicament, she was feeling sorry for Shinji but at the same time he needed to be told.  
这些话虽然刺耳，但美里和明日香都知道这是事实。如果第十三使徒没有被阻止，它就会利用托基的身体继续行动，继续杀戮，直到一无所有。尽管这很悲惨，但别无选择。美里明白这一点，也理解明日香的困境，她为真嗣感到难过，但同时他也需要被点醒。

"Asuka, I know during the Leliel incident you called Shinji a few things and I reacted harshly."  
"明日香，我知道在雷利尔事件期间你骂了真嗣几句，我当时反应过激了。"

Asuka smiled trying to make a joke out of it she remembered it all too well, she remembered being slapped and then breaking down crying in the middle of Katsuragi's office, "Harshly? I felt that slap for the next few days."  
明日香试图用微笑化解尴尬，她对此记忆犹新，记得被扇了一巴掌后在葛城美里的办公室里崩溃大哭，“过激？那巴掌我接下来好几天都记得。”

"Sorry, I shouldn't have reacted like that, you were right to express your opinion of what happened." Misato paused for a moment, "When you go back, confront him and be honest with him. Be harsh with him. He needs someone like you to do that, you're the only one who can."  
"对不起，我不该那样反应，你表达对事件的看法是对的。"美里顿了顿，"回去后，直接面对他，对他坦诚。对他严厉些。他需要像你这样的人来这么做，只有你能做到。"

"I understand, but why me?"  
"我明白，但为什么是我？"

"Because you can. If I do it I'll end up backing out at the last minute. You're stronger than me."  
"因为你行。如果我来做，我会在最后一刻退缩。你比我坚强。"

**Day Four – One Of My Turns  
第四天 —— 我的转变之一**

Asuka looked into the darkened room, in the shadows she could make out his sleeping form on the bed, his body moving silently up and down to the rhythm of his breathing. She paused for a moment just watching him sleep. She reached around for the light and flicked it on and saw his body move slightly. Not sure he was awake she began to speak, quietly at first not really sure of how to go about it.  
明日香朝昏暗的房间里望去，在阴影中她能辨认出他躺在床上的睡姿，他的身体随着呼吸的节奏无声地上下起伏。她停顿了一会儿，只是看着他睡觉。她伸手去摸灯，轻轻一按，看到他的身体微微一动。不确定他是否醒了，她开始说话，起初声音很轻，不太确定该如何开口。

"Kensuke…called me, they've arranged Touji's funeral five days from now. They want you to be there."  
“健介……给我打电话了，他们安排了真嗣的葬礼，五天后举行。他们希望你能到场。”

There was no response from him, Asuka began to feel the anger building up in her again. She tried to maintain it for now not wanting to resort to what Misato told her just yet. She spoke again, still trying to stay relatively calm.  
他没有回应，明日香又开始感到怒火在心中升腾。她试图暂时压制，不想立刻采取美里告诉她的那种方式。她再次开口，尽量保持相对平静。

"I told him we'll both be there."  
“我告诉他我们都会去的。”

Again no response from him, now she was getting annoyed. She knew he wasn't still sleeping since she had seen his body jump slightly when she had entered, so why was he ignoring her?  
他依旧沉默，这让她越发恼火。她知道他并未睡着，因为进门时她看到他的身体微微一颤，那他为何要无视她？

"So, if you want in the next few days I can take you over to Misato's to pick up your clothes. I know you have a few things here but…"  
"那么，如果你想在接下来的几天里，我可以带你去美里那里取你的衣服。我知道你这里有些东西，但是……"

She trailed off there suddenly aware of how stupid her attempts at getting him to speak were. It wasn't going to work, talking about something so insignificant was never going to work, she remembered what Misato told her yesterday and her own feelings from yesterday and decided to be honest with him.  
她说到这里突然停了下来，突然意识到自己试图让他开口的尝试是多么愚蠢。谈论如此无关紧要的事情是永远不会奏效的，她想起了昨天美里告诉她的话和昨天自己的感受，决定对他坦诚相待。

"Look Shinji I know what happened must have hurt, but you have to face up to it. You're not going to achieve anything by just doing nothing."  
"听着，真嗣，我知道发生的事情一定很痛苦，但你必须面对它。你什么都不做是不会有任何成就的。"

Still no reaction, she continued.  
她依旧没有反应，继续说道。

"If you just want to lie there and act pathetic then go ahead and do it. It may as well have been your fault he died if you're just going to do nothing."  
“如果你想继续躺在那里装可怜，那就随你便。如果你什么都不做，那他的死也可以说是你的错。”

This time it got a reaction.  
这次有了反应。

She saw him pull himself up slowly into a sitting position. He held his head in his hands. Asuka could see him shaking slightly. She wasn't sure if it was because he was upset or if it was anger with what she was saying. At least now she knew it was having an effect. She smiled slightly and continued this time sounding much more malicious.  
她看到他缓缓地坐起身来，双手抱头。明日香能察觉到他微微颤抖。她不确定是因为他感到难过，还是对她所说的话感到愤怒。至少现在她知道这番话起了作用。她微微一笑，这次语气更加恶毒地继续说道。

"You know you really are pathetic sometimes, I thought you would have changed after Leliel and you did a bit. Then this happened, I tried to feel sorry for you but how can I feel sorry for a coward like you."  
“你知道吗，有时候你真的很可悲，我以为经历了力天使事件后你会改变一些。结果又发生了这种事，我本想对你感到同情，但面对你这样的懦夫，我怎么可能同情得起来。”

She heard him sniffing quietly but didn't back down, she was fed up of feeling sorry for him or of other people feeling sorry for him. She heard him whispering quietly, it wasn't much but she could make out his words.  
她听到他轻轻地吸了吸鼻子，但没有退缩，她已经厌倦了为他感到难过或看到别人为他感到难过。她听到他低声细语，虽然声音不大，但她能听清他的话。

"Help…me…" "救…救我…"

He had stood up and was now near to her, his eyes were red and his face was streaked with tears. She didn't feel sorry for him, instead she just spat back at him.  
他站了起来，现在离她很近，眼睛通红，脸上满是泪痕。她并没有对他感到同情，反而只是朝他吐了回去。

"Help yourself Shinji." "自己救自己吧，真嗣。"

There was a pause, they both locked eyes on each other, then it happened. He lunged forward and Asuka felt his hands clasp around her throat, pushing her up against the wall. With each movement he was choking her a bit more. She didn't show any of the pain she felt instead she just continued to stare at him, her eyes showing pure hatred. He had his head bowed not looking at her, instead she heard him whispering again.  
一阵沉默，两人目光紧紧相锁，随即那一刻来临。他猛地扑向前，明日香感到他的双手紧扼住她的喉咙，将她推至墙边。每一次动作都让她窒息更甚。她没有显露丝毫痛苦，只是继续凝视着他，眼中满是纯粹的憎恨。他低着头，没有看她，取而代之的是她听到他再次低语。

"Please…help me." “请…帮帮我。”

Through the pain she was just able to respond once again putting as much hatred into it as she could, she wanted Shinji to know she didn't want to help him, she wanted him to know the hatred she felt for him at that moment. "No."  
在痛苦中，她勉强再次回应，尽可能注入更多的憎恨，她要让真嗣明白她不想帮助他，她要让他感受到那一刻她对他的憎恨。“不。”

He released his grip on her.  
他松开了对她的抓握。

As she dropped to the ground she saw the orange glow of Shinji's A.T. Field forming around him. This was not what was meant to happen, she had wanted to get a reaction from him but maybe now she had pushed him too far. She found herself unable to move as she watched Shinji stagger backwards. He screamed out and with one movement he threw the chest of drawers near her onto the ground. They landed with a violent crash, their contents spilling out over the floor.  
当她跌落在地时，她看到了真嗣的 A.T.力场在他周围形成的橙色光芒。这并非她所期望的，她本想激起他的反应，但或许现在她已将他逼得太紧。她发现自己动弹不得，只能眼睁睁看着真嗣踉跄后退。他尖叫着，猛地一挥手，将她身旁的衣柜掀翻在地。它们轰然倒下，里面的物品散落一地。

She watched on with horror as he didn't stop there, he picked up the bedside table and threw it across the room in pure rage. She didn't shout out at him to stop but instead just kept watching him as he attempted to tear up the room. She was just table to get out of the way of one of the ornaments flying towards the wall. Then almost as quickly as it had started it was over. The room was a complete mess, it could almost be likened to a bomb site. There was smashed glass from the mirrors, broken pieces of wood and an overturned mattress. In the center of it all was Shinji, who had dropped to his knees, his head in his hands. She noticed a thin trail of blood streaming from his knuckles, presumably from where he had punched through one of the mirrors.  
她惊恐地看着他并未就此罢手，他抓起床头柜，带着满腔怒火将其扔向房间的另一边。她没有大声叫他停下，而是继续注视着他试图撕毁房间。她刚好躲开了一个飞向墙壁的装饰品。然后，这一切几乎和开始时一样迅速地结束了。房间一片狼藉，简直可以比作炸弹现场。镜子碎片四散，木头碎片散落一地，床垫也被掀翻。在这一切的中心，是跪在地上的真嗣，双手抱头。她注意到他拳头上有一道细细的血流，大概是打碎镜子时留下的。

"I killed him Asuka…I could have done more…but I didn't…I should have done more…but I let him control me. I could have saved him…it's my fault he's dead."  
“我杀了他，明日香……我本可以做得更多……但我没有……我应该做得更多……但我让他控制了我。我本可以救他的……他死了是我的错。”

Asuka knelt down next to him, and pulled him towards her, allowing his head to rest on her shoulder. She felt him sobbing as she tried to think of the words to say, she was partially responsible for this. She had pushed him towards doing it, she had been told to be harsh and this was what had happened.  
明日香跪在他旁边，将他拉向自己，让他的头靠在她的肩膀上。她感觉到他在哭泣，同时努力思考该说些什么，她对此负有部分责任。是她推动他去做的，她被告知要严厉，而这正是发生的结果。

"It's not your fault he's dead, there was nothing else you could have done. But you can't live like this."  
“他的死不是你的错，你已经无能为力了。但你不能这样活下去。”

Through his sobbing he was able to respond, "I don't want to, but I don't know how. I don't want to feel the guilt for it, but I do. I don't know what to do anymore, please…help me."  
他边哭边回应道：“我不想这样，但我不知道该怎么办。我不想背负这份罪恶感，但我确实有。我不知道还能做什么了，请……帮帮我。”

Asuka looked around at it and put both her arms around him holding him tighter, "I'll try."  
明日香环顾四周，双臂紧紧抱住他，"我会努力的。"

_31st July 2015 2015 年 7 月 31 日_

**Day Nine – Goodbye Cruel World  
第九天 —— 告别残酷世界**

Shinji stood looking onward, he felt numb to it all. It was almost like something from a dream. Except he knew this wasn't a dream, it was real. He felt Asuka hold tightly onto his arm as the coffin was lowered into the hole and the priest finished speaking. Shinji didn't dare cry even if he wanted to, he didn't feel like he had the right to. It was a stupid way of thinking and he knew it, but he still felt guilt. Anyone would, his own body had been the one used to kill Touji.  
真嗣站在那里凝视着，感觉一切都麻木了。这几乎像是一场梦中的场景。但他知道这不是梦，这是真实的。他感到明日香紧紧抓住他的手臂，当棺材被放入坑中，牧师结束讲话时。真嗣甚至不敢哭泣，即使他想，他也不觉得自己有这个权利。这是一种愚蠢的想法，他知道，但他仍然感到内疚。任何人都会这样，他自己的身体就是用来杀死冬二的。

He had kept on trying to tell himself it wasn't his fault, that it was something else that caused it and that he didn't have any control over it. There was still some doubt there, could he have done more? Asuka had told him there was nothing more he could have done, that if he _did_ try to fight himself, he would have had to kill Touji anyway. The nature of the parasite and its dependence on a host only proved this further.  
他一直在试图告诉自己这不是他的错，是其他原因导致的，他对此没有控制权。但那里仍然有一些疑虑，他本可以做得更多吗？明日香告诉他，他无能为力，如果他试图反抗自己，他无论如何都得杀死冬二。寄生虫的本质及其对宿主的依赖进一步证明了这一点。

There weren't too many people at the ceremony, Touji's family, Kensuke, Shinji and Asuka, Misato and Kaji and Hikari. Hikari had grown up and gone to the same school as Shinji and Touji so knew him quite well. Asuka remembered how she reacted when she'd heard the news, no one knew it but she had feelings for Touji and although not seeing him was hoping to one day make her feelings known. She had missed her chance and was the first to break into tears.  
仪式上的人并不多，有冬二一家、剑介、真嗣和明日香，还有美里、加持和光。光已经长大，和真嗣、冬二上了同一所学校，所以对他相当熟悉。明日香记得自己听到消息时的反应，没人知道，她对冬二有着感情，虽然不常见到他，但她曾希望有一天能表露心迹。她错过了机会，第一个泪流满面。

Asuka kept hold of Shinji's arm, trying not to take any notice of what was going on. She hated being there, the damp air, the people crying and the coffin being lowered into the ground. It reminded her too much of that day twenty years ago when she watched the same thing happen to her own mother. This whole situation put her at unease, especially considering all the events leading up to it.  
明日香紧紧抓着真嗣的手臂，尽量不去注意周围发生的一切。她讨厌这里，潮湿的空气，人们的哭泣声，还有棺木被缓缓放入地下的情景。这让她不由自主地回想起二十年前，她亲眼目睹自己母亲遭遇同样一幕的那一天。整个局面让她感到不安，尤其是考虑到这一切发生前的种种事件。

The ceremony finished and people began to make there way towards the exit, aside from Touji's family. They were stood on the opposite side to Asuka and Shinji and he looked at them. Shinji didn't dare make eye contact with them. It had been bad enough when they came up to him before and tried to tell him it wasn't his fault that Touji had died. Shinji only wished he could tell them the truth but how would he explain something like that? They believed their only son had been shot dead in a shoot out as opposed to the reality that he was really the victim of an alien parasite. Maybe, Shinji thought to himself, the truth isn't always the best thing to know.  
仪式结束，人们开始向出口走去，除了东治的家人。他们站在与明日香和真嗣相对的一侧，他看着他们。真嗣不敢与他们对视。之前他们来找他，试图告诉他东治的死不是他的错，这已经够糟糕了。真嗣只希望自己能告诉他们真相，但他该如何解释那样的事情呢？他们相信他们的独子是在一场枪战中被枪杀的，而不是实际上被外星寄生虫害死的。或许，真嗣心想，真相并不总是最好的知道的东西。

He heard someone whispering next to him, "Let's go."  
他听到旁边有人低声说：“我们走吧。”

Shinji nodded as he and Asuka making their way towards the waiting car. "Asuka…I can't feel anything…"  
真嗣点头，与明日香一起向等候的车走去。“明日香……我什么感觉都没有……”

She looked at him oddly, "Well it is cold."  
她奇怪地看着他，"嗯，确实很冷。"

"No, I mean when they were doing the ceremony and they lowered the coffin. I couldn't feel anything for him, I felt numb, like I didn't even have the right to be there."  
"不，我是说他们在举行仪式，放下棺材的时候。我对他没有任何感觉，我感觉麻木，好像我根本没有权利在那里。"

She sighed, "Don't be such an idiot he was your friend of course you had the right to be there. You're not blaming yourself for what happened again are you?"  
她叹了口气，"别这么傻，他曾是你的朋友，你当然有权在那里。你又在自责发生的事了吗？"

Shinji stopped and turned, watching Touji's family leaving the cemetery "In a way I guess I am, but it's not just that. We lied to them Asuka, after all that's happened to us, all the lies we've had to listen to we turned around and fed them lies about what happened to their own son. It's not right."  
真嗣停下脚步，转身看着冬二一家离开墓园。“某种程度上我确实是，但这不仅仅是那样。我们欺骗了他们，明日香，经历了这么多事，听了这么多谎言，我们却反过来对他们撒谎，隐瞒他们儿子的真相。这不对。”

"We didn't have a choice, besides even if we did tell them the truth would they have believed us?"  
“我们别无选择，再说，即使我们说了真相，他们会相信我们吗？”

Shinji knew she was right, he nodded and agreed. "You're right, but it just doesn't feel right. We lied to them. That make's us as bad as the others who lied to us. Are we as bad as Keel or my father?"  
真嗣知道她是对的，他点头同意。“你说得对，但就是感觉不对。我们欺骗了他们。这让我们和那些对我们撒谎的人一样糟糕。我们和基尔或者我父亲一样坏吗？”

"No of course it doesn't, they lied for their own gain. We had to lie to them to protect them, if we told them, what would they have thought of us? They would have thought you were trying to make a joke of it all or that you were crazy." She paused for a moment before smiling,  
"当然不是，他们为了自己的利益撒了谎。我们不得不对他们撒谎以保护他们，如果我们告诉他们，他们会怎么想我们？他们会认为你是在拿这一切开玩笑，或者认为你疯了。"她停顿了一下，然后微笑着说，

"Of course, not that people don't already think that you're crazy."  
"当然，并不是说人们不已经认为你疯了。"

Shinji reacted moodily, although not shouting his voice was harsh and snapping, "Thanks, so now I'm a liar and crazy…"  
真嗣情绪化地回应，虽然没有大喊，但他的声音严厉而尖锐，"谢谢，现在我既是骗子又是疯子……"

"Oh come on, I was just trying to make a joke. Look it was just…the right choice."  
"哎呀，我只是想开个玩笑。看吧，这只是……正确的选择。"

"I suppose." "我想也是。"

Shinji leaned back against the car and looked onwards, there was no one left at the cemetery, Touji's family had already left. Misato, Kaji and Hikari had took another car and were heading back to NERV. Both he and Asuka looked around in silence for a bit, he felt her arm wrapping around his back. He held her and rested his head on her shoulder as they embraced each other. She spoke softly to him.  
真嗣靠在车上，向前望去，墓地里已经空无一人，东治的家人早已离开。美里、加持和光子乘坐另一辆车返回 NERV。他和明日香沉默地环顾四周片刻，他感觉到她的手臂环绕在他的背后。他拥抱着她，将头靠在她的肩上。她轻声对他说道。

"I'm sorry you had to lie to them but it was for the best. If we'd told them we risked involving them, they could have been targeted by SEELE."  
"我很抱歉你不得不对他们撒谎，但这是最好的选择。如果我们告诉他们，可能会牵连他们，他们可能会被 SEELE 盯上。"

She stopped for a few moments and continued, "We'll find a way to stop SEELE though, I'll make sure they don't succeed even if I have to fight all the remaining angels by myself and take on them alone."  
她停顿了片刻，接着说：“我们会找到阻止 SEELE 的办法，我会确保他们不会得逞，哪怕我必须独自对抗所有剩余的天使，孤身一人面对他们。”

Shinji whispered back to her, "You won't be alone."  
真嗣低声回应她：“你不会孤单的。”

"I know." "我知道。"

She gently moved his head off of her shoulder and leaned in towards him, their lips met, only this time she was aware of what she was doing. She actually wanted to kiss him this time and didn't care if anyone was watching. They stood there leaning against the car just lost in the kiss and for that moment in time there was no one else in the world, there was no conspiracy, no SEELE, nothing except for them two.  
她轻轻地将他的头从肩上移开，向他靠近，他们的唇相遇了，这一次她清楚自己在做什么。这次她真心想吻他，不在乎是否有人在看。他们倚着车，沉浸在这个吻中，那一刻，世界上没有其他人，没有阴谋，没有 SEELE，只有他们俩。

_3rd August 2015 2015 年 8 月 3 日_

**Day Twelve – Hey You  
第十二天 —— 嘿，你**

"Misato…should we really be doing this?"  
“美里……我们真的应该这么做吗？”

She giggled, "We've already have done it several times to be precise."  
她咯咯笑着，“准确地说，我们已经做过好几次了。”

He laid back on the bed, speaking in a serious tone. "Don't you think it's a bit too soon though?"  
他躺回床上，语气严肃地说：“你不觉得这有点太快了吗？”

Misato looked at her bandaged arm, it was still injured. Each time they had made love that evening she had felt pain shooting through it but she didn't care. She shrugged it off, "I'm fine, don't worry about me."  
美里看着她包扎着的手臂，伤势依旧。每次他们那晚亲热时，她都能感到疼痛袭来，但她并不在意。她耸耸肩，“我没事，别担心我。”

Kaji smiled weakly while Misato lit up a cigarette, he looked her over as she sat with her back to him with only the sheets covering her. He was concerned about her, she hadn't been the same since he had come to NERV and definitely not since Shinji had been captured by Leliel. He couldn't blame her and he didn't really help the entire situation keeping all those secrets from them. Something stopped him though, fear. He knew what would happen if he told them anything. He had to choose the right times to reveal small pieces of the puzzle, though by the time he told everything, it wouldn't matter.  
加持虚弱地笑了笑，而美里点燃了一支烟，他打量着她，她背对着他坐着，身上仅盖着床单。他担心她，自从他来到 NERV 后，她就不再是以前的样子了，更不用说真嗣被雷利尔抓走之后了。他不能怪她，他也没有真正帮助整个情况，一直对他们隐瞒那些秘密。但某种东西阻止了他，是恐惧。他知道如果他说出任何事情会发生什么。他必须选择合适的时机来揭露谜题的小片段，尽管到他讲出一切的时候，那已经无关紧要了。

Something inside him kept on telling him that he was just running away from it, that he was a coward for pretending to know nothing or for lying to the people around him. That was why he felt uneasy now. It didn't feel right, Misato was depending on him yet he kept on lying. He wanted to stop the lying, he cared about her, he would even go as far as to say he loved her, but he couldn't do anything about it.  
他内心有个声音一直在告诉他，他只是在逃避，他是个懦夫，假装一无所知或对周围的人撒谎。这就是为什么他现在感到不安。这感觉不对，美里依赖着他，而他却一直在撒谎。他想停止撒谎，他关心她，他甚至可以说他爱她，但他对此无能为力。

"Kaji…what happened to us all those years ago?"  
“加持……那些年我们到底发生了什么？”

"We were young Misato, too young but we each had our own lives. You wanted to stay here in Japan and worked with NERV, I joined but got sent to Germany. It was never going to work like that."  
"我们那时太年轻了，美里，太年轻了，但我们各自有各自的生活。你想留在日本，加入 NERV 工作，而我加入了却被派往德国。那样是行不通的。"

Misato wasn't sure if Kaji truthfully couldn't remember what had happened or if he was just trying to cover up how harsh it really was. She did remember the situation, the last meeting between them after which Kaji had flown out to Germany. Three months previously, she had told him it wasn't going to work, that it would be best for both of them if they didn't see each other. Ironically she broke it off a month before Kaji learnt he was going to Germany.  
美里不确定鹫尾是否真的忘记了发生的事情，还是只是在掩饰当时的残酷。她确实记得那个情景，那是他们最后一次见面，之后鹫尾就飞往了德国。三个月前，她告诉他这样行不通，对他们俩来说，最好的办法就是不再见面。讽刺的是，她在鹫尾得知自己将去德国的一个月前提出了分手。

"Yet ironically we meet up again over ten years later working with the two very people we we're guardians of. Maybe we were wrong…"  
"然而讽刺的是，十多年后我们再次相遇，共同工作的对象正是我们曾经守护的两个人。也许我们错了……"

"We weren't wrong, just not completely right either. It might have worked but at a later date."  
"我们并非完全错误，只是也不完全正确。或许它本该在更晚些时候生效。"

"Like now you mean?" "你是说现在吗？"

"Precisely." “正是如此。”

She paused for a moment before lying back in the bed and putting her arms around Kaji, "What was it like over there, bringing up Asuka? That can't have been easy."  
她在床上躺下，双手环抱住加持，沉思片刻后问道：“在那边抚养明日香是什么感觉？那肯定不容易吧。”

"I didn't really have much involvement as you did with Shinji to be honest. I wasn't a full guardian I was just friends with her family and helped look after her. Her father never really had any time for her and...well I'm sure you know what happened to her mother, I was just there to look after her. She was difficult, she believed she was the best at everything."  
"说实话，我对真嗣的参与并不像你那么多。我不是她的全权监护人，只是她家的朋友，帮忙照顾她。她父亲几乎没有时间陪伴她，而且...嗯，我相信你知道她母亲发生了什么，我只是在那里照顾她。她很难相处，她相信自己在各方面都是最优秀的。"

Misato smiled slightly, from knowing Asuka now it wasn't really hard to believe. "And was she?"  
美里微微一笑，从现在对明日香的了解来看，这并不难相信。“她真的是吗？”

Kaji responded his voice still sounding serious. "Usually yes, she pushed herself really hard in everything she did. She never let anything upset her, a sign of weakness according to her. She just had a wall there, she'd say one thing but you could see in her eyes exactly who she was and what she really meant. She was lost, lonely, she needed someone. When I saw her again on the Over The Rainbow, she had toned down the arrogance but the look in her eyes was still there, waiting to reach out to someone or for someone to notice and reach out to her."  
加持的声音依然严肃地回答。“通常是的，她在所做的每件事上都拼尽全力。她从不让任何事情影响自己，对她来说，这是软弱的表现。她有一堵墙，嘴上说一件事，但你从她的眼睛里能看出她真正的想法和意图。她迷失了，孤独，她需要有人陪伴。当我在‘彩虹之上’再次见到她时，她已经收敛了傲慢，但眼中的神情依旧，等待着有人伸出援手，或者有人注意到并走向她。”

"Did you ever try?" "你试过吗？"

Kaji shook his head, "No I couldn't, and it wasn't my place to. But I noticed in the past few days, that look…it's fading slightly. It's still there but it's not as noticeable, it's almost as if she has finally found someone."  
加持摇了摇头，"不，我没有，那也不是我的位置。但我注意到在过去的几天里，那种表情……它在逐渐消失。虽然还在，但已经不那么明显了，就好像她终于找到了某个人。"

"You mean Shinji?" "你是说真嗣？"

He grinned slightly as he spoke, "They're suited for each other, they're the opposite in terms of personality but when you look at their backgrounds and what's inside, they could almost be the same person, they just deal with it differently. It's the old cliché, opposites attract..."  
他微微一笑，说道：“他们挺般配的，性格上截然相反，但看他们的背景和内心，几乎可以说是同一个人，只是处理方式不同。这就是那句老话，异性相吸……”

"Shinji never really had someone to reach out to either" Katsuragi said "I tried to be that person, but maybe I was too forward for him or maybe it was because I wasn't really related to him. Maybe you're right, maybe they are suited for each other."  
“真嗣也从未真正有人可以依靠。”葛城说，“我试图成为那个人，但也许我对他来说太过主动，或者也许是因为我与他并无血缘关系。也许你是对的，也许他们确实很般配。”

"Two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl…"  
“两个迷失的灵魂在鱼缸里游弋……”

"What?" "什么？"

"Nothing, just lines from a song I once heard."  
“没什么，只是一首我曾听过的歌里的歌词。”

_12th August 2015 2015 年 8 月 12 日_

**Day Twenty One – The Show Must Go On  
第二十一天 —— 演出必须继续**

Fuyutsuki dropped the folder onto Gendo's desk, his expression was solemn, a stark contrast to Gendo who was bearing his patented arrogant smile. The old professor was once again unsure of what to think, he had seen the files he had even given his blessing for it to go ahead, but now that it had started he wasn't really too sure if it was the right decision. Unfortunately there was no going back now, he looked once again at the name on the front of the document.  
冬月将文件夹丢在碇的桌上，他的表情严肃，与碇那标志性的傲慢笑容形成鲜明对比。这位老教授又一次不确定该如何思考，他曾看过这些文件，甚至给予了批准，但现在事情开始了，他不太确定这是否是正确的决定。遗憾的是，现在已无法回头，他再次看向文件封面上的名字。

"Misato Katsuragi the only survivor of the impact incident fifteen years ago, the same woman who would later go on to join NERV and work for those who helped to assist in the Impact. Became legal guardian of one Shinji Ikari, who is now one of the Evangelions, when he was aged fourteen she now oversees all missions assigned to him and the other Evangelions."  
“葛城美里，十五年前撞击事件的唯一幸存者，后来加入 NERV 并为协助引发冲击的人工作。成为真嗣的法定监护人，当时他十四岁，现在负责监督分配给他的以及其他 EVA 的所有任务。”

"I am aware of her history Fuyutsuki, you are concerned about something?"  
“我对她的历史有所了解，冬月，你在担心什么？”

Fuyutsuki chuckled, "You know me Ikari I'm always concerned. Since twenty years ago when we became a part of this project I was concerned and nothing has changed since then. Have we gone too far this time, if the committee learns of this they will kill us, we can't cover up something like this? Shinji will suspect something as well, what are you going to tell him?"  
冬月轻笑一声，“真嗣，你了解我的，我总是忧心忡忡。自从二十年前我们加入这个项目以来，我就一直如此，从未改变。这次我们是否走得太远了？如果委员会得知此事，他们会置我们于死地，我们无法掩盖这样的事情。真嗣也会起疑心，你打算怎么告诉他？”

"I will tell him what he needs to know and no more and I do not believe we will be hearing from the committee on this issue. It is not something they are interested in, Katsuragi is not one of their priorities."  
“我会告诉他他需要知道的，仅此而已。而且我不认为委员会会就此事找我们麻烦。这不是他们感兴趣的事，葛城并不是他们的优先考虑对象。”

"What about Katsuragi herself? This is far beyond anything we have done before."  
“那葛城自己呢？这远远超出了我们以往所做的一切。”

"It was our only choice, our only hope for our scenario, our only regret is that we cannot steer this any further than we already have. The tide is turning in our direction, our role has been fulfilled, all we can do now is watch as it plays out."  
"这是我们唯一的选择，我们唯一的希望，唯一的遗憾是我们无法再进一步引导这一切。局势正朝着我们有利的方向转变，我们的角色已经完成，现在只能静观其变。"

"So we're just going to sit back and watch?"  
"所以我们只是坐视不管？"

Gendo smiled "The future lies in my son's hands, we will assist in steering it towards what we want but beyond that it is up to him."  
碇源堂微笑道：“未来掌握在我儿子手中，我们将协助引导它走向我们期望的方向，但最终如何，取决于他。”

Fuyutsuki reacted with surprise, "I never thought I'd hear that from you."  
冬月反应惊讶，“我从没想到会从你口中听到这话。”

"Hear what?" “听到什么？”

This time it was Fuyutsuki's turn to wear a cocky smile, he answered sharply, "You refer to Shinji as your son."  
这次轮到冬月露出得意的笑容，他尖锐地回答，“你称真嗣为你的儿子。”

"A mere slip of the tongue Professor, nothing more."  
"教授，只是口误而已，没什么大不了的。"

_19th August 2015 2015 年 8 月 19 日_  
**Day Twenty Eight – Isn't This Where We Came In?  
第二十八天——这不是我们开始的地方吗？**

Shinji felt his stomach churn as the lift got down to the basement level. This was his first day back in NERV since Bardiel, it was not something he had been looking forward to, unfortunately Asuka was not with him, she had been called out somewhere else to investigate. He took a deep breath as the elevator doors opened and stepped out into the corridor.  
电梯下降到地下层时，真嗣感到胃里一阵翻腾。这是自巴迪尔事件后他第一天回到 NERV，遗憾的是，明日香并不在他身边，她被派往别处调查了。电梯门打开时，他深吸一口气，踏入了走廊。

He stopped when he noticed a man he didn't recognize stood outside the office, their eyes met for a brief moment, Shinji could have sworn he saw a hint of recognition in this other mans eyes. He shrugged it off as tiredness and greeted him.  
当他注意到办公室外站着一个他不认识的男人时，他停下了脚步。两人的目光短暂交汇，真嗣几乎可以肯定，在那陌生人的眼中看到了一丝熟悉的痕迹。他将其归咎于疲劳，并上前打招呼。

"Hello there, can I help you?"  
“你好，有什么我能帮忙的吗？”

The man spoke, his voice rather apologetic, "Hi I've just been assigned to the NERV Branch here, and I was assigned to work under Agent Katsuragi."  
男子开口道，语气颇为歉意，“嗨，我刚被分配到这里的 NERV 分部，被指派在葛城美里特工手下工作。”

"Misato? Her office is up on the fourth floor."  
“美里？她的办公室在四楼。”

The man looked at him oddly, "Really? I was told she worked here."  
男子奇怪地看着他，“真的吗？我被告知她在这里工作。”

As the man spoke Shinji felt a chill run down his spine, something didn't feel right about him. The way he spoke and his mannerisms just seemed off to him, once again Shinji just put it down to tiredness and tried to answer his question. "Well in a way she does, sorry I didn't introduce myself. I'm Agent Ikari, Agent Katsuragi is my immediate superior."  
当那男人说话时，真嗣感到一阵寒意沿着脊背而下，总觉得他有些不对劲。他的说话方式和举止在真嗣看来都显得格格不入，但真嗣又一次将其归咎于疲劳，并试图回答他的问题。“某种程度上是的，抱歉我还没自我介绍。我是碇真嗣特工，葛城美里特工是我的直接上级。”

The man nodded and introduced himself, "Agent Carter, I've been assigned to work with NERV on a special case by my government. I guess we'll be seeing more of each other  
那男人点头并自我介绍道：“卡特特工，我被我的政府指派与 NERV 合作处理一桩特殊案件。看来我们会有更多交集。”

"I see, well if you want Katsuragi she'll probably be up on the fourth floor, but she'll be down here in about half an hour if you want to wait."  
“我明白了，如果你想找葛城美里，她可能在四楼，但如果你想等的话，她大约半小时后会下来。”

"No that's alright, I'll go and find her."  
“不，没关系，我自己去找她。”

Carter left without saying anything else, Shinji shrugged as he let himself into the room. Surprisingly the door was already unlocked, he stepped inside to find Asuka busy at work at her desk. Slightly confused he walked over to her and greeted her, "Asuka, I thought you were..."  
卡特没再说什么就离开了，真嗣耸耸肩，自己进了房间。出乎意料的是，门已经没锁，他走进去发现明日香正忙着在桌前工作。他有些困惑地走过去打招呼，“明日香，我以为你在……”

She cut him off, "…working on something else? Yes I am, I returned about fifteen minutes ago. What do you know about the Marduk Institute?"  
她打断了他，“……在做别的事情？是的，我确实在做，我大约十五分钟前回来的。你对马杜克研究所了解多少？”

Shinji nodded his head and began speaking, "World leader in medical research, provided support and shelters after the impact, provided support for people all around the world and has the support of governments all over. Why do you ask?"  
真嗣点点头，开始说道：“全球医疗研究的领军者，在撞击事件后提供了支持和庇护所，为世界各地的人们提供援助，并得到了各国政府的支持。你为什么这么问？”

"This case I was tipped off about, it was a woman, not quite sure who. She didn't show up, for an arranged meeting anyway. When I did arrive I was contacted by security, they seemed to know I was going there…"  
“这个案子，我是从一个女人那里得到的消息，不太确定是谁。她没有出现，至少没有按约定出现。当我到达时，安保人员联系了我，他们似乎知道我会去那里……”

Shinji nodded, "Right." 真嗣点点头，“没错。”

She continued, "Turns out the guy in charge has gone missing, not a trace of him anywhere. No one has seen him for the past twenty eight days."  
她继续说道：“结果发现负责的那个人失踪了，任何地方都没有他的踪迹。过去二十八天里没人见过他。”

"How come it's just been reported today then?"  
“那为什么今天才报道呢？”

"That's the thing, the last communication or sighting of him was twenty eight days ago when he was scheduled to have a meeting with three other people. Three of these people left the building, Mr Nagisa, the person in charge, did not. However someone has been sending down orders for those days, only problem is after consulting the records that person was not Mr Nagisa."  
“问题就在这里，最后一次与他通讯或目击到他是在二十八天前，当时他预定要与另外三个人开会。这三个人离开了大楼，负责人长井先生却没有。然而，那些天下达命令的人，经过查证记录，并不是长井先生。”

"What do you suspect?" "你怀疑什么？"

"Kidnapping most likely, Nagisa and Marduk were on the verge of unveiling a working Aids Vaccine at the end of the year. I would imagine a few people would like to get their hands on that and its creator."  
"很可能是绑架，渚和马尔杜克即将在年底揭晓一种有效的艾滋病疫苗。我想会有不少人想要得到它及其创造者。"

Shinji inwardly agreed but he knew there was something else to it than what she had just mentioned, "So what's the catch?"  
真嗣内心同意，但他知道事情不止她刚才提到的那么简单，“那么，关键是什么？”

She answered him, "No groups have taken responsibility and no one's left a ransom note. No body has been found and no records of him ever leaving have been found. It's almost as if he has just vanished into thin air."  
她回答他，“没有任何组织声称对此负责，也没有留下赎金条。没有发现尸体，也没有他离开的记录。他几乎就像是凭空消失了。”

"I see well couldn't we…?"  
“我明白了，那我们能不能……？”

Shinji was interrupted by a knocking at the door, the door opened and Misato poked her head into the room and called towards the door of them, she had a solemn expression on her face and didn't waste time in giving them instructions..  
真嗣的话被敲门声打断，门开了，美里探头进来，朝他们喊了一声，她脸上带着严肃的表情，没有浪费时间就给他们下达了指示。

"Can I have a quick word with you two?"  
"能和你们俩说句话吗？"

Shinji nodded, wondering why she wanted to speak to them. He wondered if it was something to do with the Agent he had met a few minutes ago, "Of course, come on in."  
真嗣点点头，好奇她为什么想和他们说话。他猜想是否与几分钟前遇到的特工有关，“当然，请进。”

She stepped into the room and stood before them with the same solemn look, "Look I know you might find this hard to believe and…well… it may be a bit strange, but me and Kaji are back together."  
她走进房间，站在他们面前，神情同样严肃，“听着，我知道你们可能难以置信，而且……嗯……这可能有点奇怪，但我跟加持又复合了。”

Shinji and Asuka nodded and just gave grunts of acknowledgment. They'd already known that. It had been obvious for weeks, Misato frowned at their lack of interest. "Well you two are enthusiastic, well that's not the only piece of news."  
真嗣和明日香点点头，只是发出几声应答的咕哝。他们早就知道了。这事已经明显了几个星期，美里对他们缺乏兴趣的态度皱起了眉头。“好吧，你们俩真是热情高涨，不过这还不是唯一的消息。”

Asuka chimed in, "Let me guess you stayed at his place last night?"  
明日香插话道，“让我猜猜，你昨晚住在他那儿了？”

Shinji tried to stop himself from laughing, he didn't really want to annoy Misato especially knowing how she could wind both of them up. Misato ignored Asuka and continued speaking.  
真嗣努力忍住笑意，他并不真的想惹恼美里，尤其是知道她能如何激怒他们俩。美里无视了明日香，继续说着。

"Like I said, it might seem a bit strange and even I find it hard to believe but we had it confirmed last week…." She paused for a moment before blurting out quickly, "I'm pregnant."  
“就像我说的，这可能看起来有点奇怪，连我自己都难以置信，但我们上周已经确认了……”她停顿了一下，然后迅速脱口而出，“我怀孕了。”

### Chapter 22 About To Crash

_23__rd_ _August 2015_ 2015 年 8 月 23 日

**Marduk Institute – 1015 hours  
马杜克研究所 – 上午 10 点 15 分**

Shinji entered the main lobby, much to his surprise both Asuka and the newly assigned Agent Carter had already arrived and were waiting for him. He looked around the main lobby, which was a lot grander than he had expected for the humble Marduk Institute. Then again, it was a multi billion dollar organization so it was allowed to be a bit majestic, even if it was dealing with producing vaccines and support for millions around the world.  
真嗣走进主大厅，令他惊讶的是，明日香和新指派的特工卡特已经到了，正在等他。他环顾了一下主大厅，其宏伟程度远超他对这个朴素的马尔杜克机构的预期。不过话说回来，作为一个拥有数十亿美元资产的组织，它有资格显得有些庄严，即便它主要从事疫苗生产和全球数百万人的支持工作。

As he entered he was stopped by one of the security guards, he held up his NERV ID and quickly made his way past them. To his right he noticed a small group of people talking excitedly as he approached, they took out cameras and started taking photographs of him much to the annoyance of the buildings security who immediately ushered them out of the building.  
当他进入时，一名保安拦住了他，他出示了 NERV 的身份证，迅速通过了他们。在他右边，他注意到一小群人正兴奋地交谈着，当他走近时，他们拿出相机开始给他拍照，这让大楼的保安非常恼火，他们立即把这些人赶出了大楼。

He didn't need to ask about it, Asuka read it on his face and filled him in, "Reporters, a few of them got a tip off that Mr. Nagisa had gone missing, that's about the fourth group they've had to deal with this morning."  
他不需要问，明日香从他的表情中读出了疑惑，并告诉他：“记者，有几个人得到了碇先生失踪的消息，这是他们今天早上处理的第四批了。”

Shinji looked at the group being forced out of the building and shook his head, "I thought we had a media blackout on this incident."  
真嗣看着那群被赶出大楼的人，摇了摇头，“我以为我们对这起事件实施了媒体封锁。”

Asuka responded without really caring about the cameras being aimed at her, if anything she was finding the whole thing quite humorous. "We do, but that's not going to stop something being leaked. Nagisa was a friend of the media's. He's had interviews scheduled for the past month and not turned up to a single one. Someone was bound to put two and two together eventually."  
明日香回应道，对那些对准她的摄像机并不在意，反而觉得整个事情颇为滑稽。“我们是封锁了，但那阻止不了消息泄露。渚是媒体的朋友。他过去一个月里安排了多次采访，却一次都没露面。总有人会把这些线索串联起来的。”

Shinji looked around, Carter was busy speaking to one of the members of security making sure another little incident did not occur. He still wasn't sure about Agent Carter. Something about him struck Shinji as odd, maybe it was just the sudden assignment to NERV by the American Government. Shinji had never heard of such a thing happening before, yet it was legit and Shinji couldn't argue against it.  
真嗣环顾四周，卡特正忙着和一名安保人员交谈，确保不会再发生小插曲。他仍然对卡特特工不太放心。总觉得他有些奇怪，也许是美国政府突然将他调到 NERV 的缘故。真嗣以前从未听说过这种事，尽管这是合法的，他也没法反驳。

Behind him he heard Asuka sighing and speaking in an annoyed tone, "Let me guess, you don't trust him?"  
在他身后，他听到明日香叹了口气，用不耐烦的语气说：“让我猜猜，你不信任他？”

Shinji turned and smiled slightly. Was it that easy for Asuka to know what he was thinking? He nodded, "Now what would make you say such a thing?"  
真嗣转过身，微微一笑。明日香就这么容易看穿他的心思吗？他点点头，“你怎么会这么想？”

She shrugged, "I don't know, maybe the fact that I've been thinking the same thing myself and you're you."  
她耸耸肩，“我不知道，也许是因为我自己也在这么想，而你就是你。”

Shinji was ready to reply, but she quickly cut him off with a quick kiss to the lips which soon made him forget what he was about to say.  
真嗣正准备回答，但她迅速用一个轻吻封住了他的唇，让他很快忘记了原本要说的话。

"Shouldn't we be focusing more on the investigation than…our own personal time, especially with all these reporters hanging around?"  
“我们不应该更专注于调查吗……而不是……我们的私人时间，尤其是周围还有这么多记者？”

Asuka broke off the kiss and looked to her left, Carter was looking at them both suspiciously. Both Shinji and Asuka looked at each other, rather embarrassed. Asuka stammered when she spoke, "O…O…Yeah, well we were just discussing the case and the disappearance."  
明日香结束了亲吻，向左看去，卡特正怀疑地盯着他们俩。真嗣和明日香互相对视，都有些尴尬。明日香结结巴巴地说：“哦……哦……是啊，我们只是在讨论案件和失踪事件。”

Shinji restrained himself from laughing. It wouldn't really look good if he did and he was sure Asuka wouldn't be too pleased either. Instead, he tried to take the attention off of what had just happened, "So what do we have Agent Carter?"  
真嗣强忍住笑意。如果他笑出来，看起来就不太好了，而且他确信明日香也不会太高兴。于是，他试图转移大家对刚才发生的事情的注意力，“那么，我们有什么发现吗，卡特探员？”

Carter shook his head and spoke, "Compared to what we knew a few days ago when Agent Sohryu was informed about the case…absolutely nothing. Still no contact from anybody. They are going to let us have the CCTV Tapes soon, so we can look them over but they assure us there is nothing on them."  
卡特摇了摇头，说道：“与几天前我们得知的情况相比，当碇探员被告知这个案件时……我们一无所获。仍然没有任何联系。他们很快就会把监控录像带给我们，这样我们就可以仔细查看，但他们向我们保证录像带上没有任何线索。”

Shinji nodded, "Well we'll see about that, not everything is as it seems at first glance."  
真嗣点头道：“好吧，我们拭目以待，并非所有事情都像初看时那样简单。”

Carter looked at him strangely, "Oh yes of course, well I don't think we'll have to worry about your alien theories here. I prefer to deal in the real world, Ikari, and I think you'd do better to do the same."  
卡特奇怪地看着他，"哦，当然，好吧，我想我们不必担心你的外星理论在这里。我更喜欢处理现实世界的问题，碇，我认为你最好也这样做。"

Shinji got ready to respond but he felt Asuka squeeze his shoulder tightly. Instead, she was the one who responded, "I'd suggest you focus more on the case than on Shinji's beliefs, besides, you might be surprised."  
真嗣准备好回应，但他感觉到明日香紧紧捏了他的肩膀。相反，是明日香回应道，"我建议你更多地关注案件而不是真嗣的信仰，此外，你可能会感到惊讶。"

"It'll take a lot of convincing but you're right, we should stop worrying about that which doesn't exist and focus on what is happening. We'll take another look around the office and then get the tapes from security."  
“这需要很多说服，但你是对的，我们应该停止担心那些不存在的事情，专注于正在发生的事情。我们会再次查看办公室，然后从安保那里获取录像带。”

Carter walked back off towards the security guards to arrange access to the office, Shinji felt Asuka kneel down next to him and whisper into his ear, "You know I think I preferred working with Ayanami, at least she was quiet."  
卡特转身走向保安，安排进入办公室的权限，真嗣感到明日香跪在他旁边，对着他的耳朵低语：“你知道吗，我觉得我更喜欢和绫波一起工作，至少她很安静。”

**Tokyo 3 Park – 1030 hours  
第三新东京市公园 – 上午 10:30**

Rei stepped through the gates and looked around, the hot August sun beating down on her as she walked casually through Tokyo 3's central park. All around her were the excited screams of children, people riding bikes, people walking their dogs, families out on picnics. Each one of them enjoying themselves. This was a place people came for enjoyment, but if that was the case then why was she feeling sadness?  
绫波穿过公园大门，环顾四周，八月的烈日炙烤着她，她悠闲地走在第三新东京市中心公园里。周围是孩子们兴奋的尖叫声，人们骑着自行车，遛狗，家庭在野餐。每个人都在享受着。这是一个人们来享受的地方，但如果真是如此，那她为何感到悲伤呢？

She didn't even know why she was here, she had never had a desire to walk amongst Tokyo 3 before or interact with strangers. This was all new to her, she had never done simple things like walk through parks or Tokyo 3's countryside. She had only spent time in her old apartment, with Gendo or in NERV. She was used to spending time by herself and if she was being honest she preferred it that way. Interacting with strangers was uncomfortable to her.  
她甚至不知道自己为何会在这里，从未有过在第三新东京市漫步或与陌生人交流的欲望。这一切对她来说都是全新的体验，她从未做过像在公园散步或穿越第三新东京市郊区这样简单的事情。她只在自己的旧公寓里、与源堂在一起或在 NERV 度过时光。她习惯于独处，老实说她更喜欢那样。与陌生人互动让她感到不适。

She stopped for a moment to look around and took particular interest in some of the blue flowers that had been planted nearby. She knelt down and looked closer at the flower, which was a pale shade of blue. These flowers were separated from the rest, protected by a small mesh enclosure. They were isolated from everything else, sheltered and left to grow on there own. In a strange way they reminded Rei of herself, she thought it was unusual being able to identify with such an insignificant item like a flower, but in many ways it was like her.  
她停下脚步环顾四周，特别留意到附近种植的一些蓝色花朵。她跪下来仔细观察那朵花，它是淡蓝色的。这些花朵与其他花朵隔离开来，被一个小网罩保护着。它们孤立于其他一切之外，被庇护着，独自生长。在某种奇怪的方式上，它们让丽想起了自己，她觉得能与一朵如此微不足道的花朵产生共鸣很奇怪，但在很多方面，它们就像她一样。

She was separated, different, brought up away from everything else and she didn't know how to interact with others beyond a basic level. Until she was assigned to NERV by Gendo, all she knew was her cold, lonesome apartment and the director. She, much like those flowers, had been isolated from the rest of the world to grow. Just like the flower, when she left would no one care?  
她与众不同，被隔离开来，从小远离一切，不知如何与他人深入交往。直到被源堂分配到 NERV，她所熟悉的只有那冷清孤独的公寓和那位导演。她，就像那些花朵一样，被隔离于世界之外成长。就像那花朵，当她离去时，会有人在意吗？

'_No….that's not true, he would notice. Ikari cares for me and won't let that happen.'_  
'不……那不是真的，他会注意到的。碇关心我，不会让这种事发生。'

She felt a strange feeling in her heart as she looked across the sheltered area. That sense of emptiness had always been there in her heart but it had never felt like this before. It felt amplified. Maybe because she had tasted human contact and met other people beyond the director. Or maybe it as she thought, had always been there, just overtime that emptiness had grown bigger.  
她望着这片遮蔽的区域，心中涌起一种奇异的感觉。那种空虚感一直存在于她心中，但从未像现在这样强烈。它似乎被放大了。也许是因为她尝到了人际交往的滋味，遇见了导演以外的人。又或许正如她所想，那份空虚一直都在，只是随着时间的推移，它变得更大了。

Over the past months though, she hadn't felt like that. She had felt like she had a purpose and like she belonged. Rei realized it may have been a bit strange considering how she had came into NERV, but those months her relationships with Sohryu, Katsuragi and Shinji had developed. They had seemed to care, they had tried to give her a purpose to make her feel human. Despite what she had done to them they had helped her. When she had nowhere to go Asuka had given her a place to stay, when she had fell ill Shinji had defended her. She had a connection with them, a bond had grown. It was something she had never felt before.  
然而在过去几个月里，她不再有那种感觉。她觉得自己有了目标，找到了归属感。尽管意识到自己进入 NERV 的方式有些奇怪，但这几个月来，她与惣流、葛城和真嗣的关系确实在发展。他们似乎真的关心她，努力赋予她存在的意义，让她感受到人性的温暖。尽管她曾对他们造成伤害，他们却依然伸出援手。无处可去时，明日香给了她容身之所；病倒时，真嗣挺身保护她。她与他们之间建立了联系，一种纽带在悄然生长。这是她从未体验过的情感。

Now that had been taken away from her. She had known it would happen, that her place with NERV was only temporary. Gendo had explained the reason for it, that he wanted her to work behind the scenes again and not in public. That something big was due to happen and he didn't want her to get caught up in it, but she wanted to get involved for some reason. Even though she knew she couldn't and shouldn't get caught up in it, she wanted to.  
如今这一切被夺走了。她早知道会有这一天，明白自己在 NERV 的位置只是暂时的。碇源堂解释过原因，说他希望她重新回到幕后工作，不再公开露面。因为即将发生一件大事，他不希望她卷入其中，但她不知为何却渴望参与进去。尽管明知自己不该也不能卷入，内心却无法抑制那份渴望。

She turned from the blue flowers, feeling that she had spent enough time with them. She still didn't understand what pleasure people got from them. All that she had gotten so far was sadness as she tried to go through everything in her mind. She looked across at the other flowers there, the ones growing free in the wild with all the others. The bright red color of them reminded her much of her ex-colleague, Agent Sohryu.  
她从那些蓝花中转身离开，觉得已经和它们待得够久了。她仍然不明白人们从它们身上得到了什么乐趣。到目前为止，她所感受到的只有悲伤，因为她试图在脑海中梳理一切。她望向那边的其他花朵，那些在野外自由生长的花朵，与其他的混在一起。它们鲜红的颜色让她想起了她的前同事，Sohryu 特工。

Rei had never really figured out Sohryu, but at the same time she maybe even envied her a bit. Sohryu was free to do as she wished and she could forge those proper bonds and interact with people as she desired. At the same time though, despite Asuka being free and able to do as she wanted, Rei could sense something else inside her. A sadness and a feeling of isolation much like her own. Rei couldn't really figure out why she sensed those within Sohryu but she felt it there.  
丽从未真正理解过 Sohryu，但与此同时，她可能甚至有点羡慕她。Sohryu 可以自由地做她想做的事，并且能够建立那些适当的联系，按照她的意愿与人交往。然而，尽管明日香自由自在，能够随心所欲，丽却能感觉到她内心深处的东西。一种悲伤和孤独感，与她自己的感觉非常相似。丽无法真正弄清楚为什么她会在 Sohryu 身上感受到这些，但她确实感觉到了。

Rei turned from looking at the flowers and considered going back home. She felt like maybe coming here was a big mistake. It hadn't helped her at all, it had only made her feel worse about the entire thing.  
丽转身不再看那些花，考虑着回家。她觉得也许来这里是个大错误。这根本没有帮助她，反而让她对整件事感到更糟。

Rei stood and felt a slight presence behind her. She turned and found an old grey haired man looking at her with an arrogant smile on his face. Quickly she felt herself grow cold as she recognized him. She said nothing, instead waiting for him to speak. She had been warned that something like this might happen now that she was no longer working with NERV.  
丽站起身，感觉到身后轻微的存在感。她转身发现一位灰白头发的老人正带着傲慢的微笑看着她。她立刻感到一阵寒意，认出了他。她一言不发，只是等待着他开口。自从她不再为 NERV 工作以来，她已被警告可能会发生这样的事情。

"Agent...or should I say former Agent Ayanami? What a coincidence it is seeing you in a place like this."  
“特工……或者我应该说前特工绫波？在这样的地方遇见你真是巧合。”

Rei turned around to face him, so this was the person the Director had warned her about. She had never met him before nor had she really desired to. All she knew was what his role was with SEELE. She addressed him without questioning his reason for being there, already pretty sure of the reasons.  
丽转过身面对他，这就是总监警告她要提防的人。她以前从未见过他，也从未真正想见。她只知道他在 SEELE 中的角色。她没有质疑他出现在这里的原因，已经大致猜到了缘由。

"Chairman Keel, do you have business with Director Ikari today?"  
"基尔议长，您今天有事找碇指挥官吗？"

"No I don't, I'm just out taking a walk. What brings you to such a place?"  
"没有，我只是出来散散步。你来这种地方有什么事吗？"

Rei couldn't answer him. She didn't even know herself why she was there. She had thought that maybe taking a walk would help her sort out her head. Since she was told she was no longer a part of NERV, she had felt conflicted. She wasn't really sure what it was she felt. Over the weeks at NERV she had changed, developed bonds and feelings for the people she worked with. Shinji, Sohryu and to a lesser extent Katsuragi, it felt strange to be pulled away from them so suddenly.  
绫波无法回答他。她甚至不知道自己为何会来这里。她原以为散步或许能帮她理清思绪。自从被告知不再是 NERV 的一员后，她感到矛盾重重。她并不完全确定自己的感受。在 NERV 的这几周里，她发生了变化，与共事的人建立了情感纽带。真嗣、惣流，以及在较小程度上还有葛城，突然被从他们身边拉开，感觉很奇怪。

Keel recognized her struggling to respond and answered for her, "Maybe you're looking for reasons. After all, being discarded like a doll whose owner has gotten bored with it… it must sting a bit."  
基尔看出她在努力回应，便替她答道：“或许你在寻找理由。毕竟，像一个被主人厌倦的玩偶一样被抛弃……一定有点刺痛吧。”

"I have not been discarded…the director just has…."  
“我没有被抛弃……导演只是……”

"Has what? Other puppets, other dolls to manipulate as he wishes? You know it's true Rei, you knew the day would eventually come when the master would cut the puppets strings. You served your purpose and now he no longer has a use for you."  
“只是什么？有其他傀儡，其他玩偶供他随意操纵？你知道这是真的，丽，你知道终有一天主人会剪断傀儡的线。你完成了你的使命，现在他不再需要你了。”

Each word felt like a dagger in Rei. She had never felt like this before, having never had to really deal with emotions like sadness or despair. Gendo had seen to it that she had never had to feel that and now she didn't even know how to deal with it. She tried to cover up but could only stutter out weakly.  
每一个字都像一把利刃刺入丽的心。她从未有过这样的感觉，从未真正面对过悲伤或绝望这样的情感。源堂确保了她从未需要感受这些，而现在她甚至不知道该如何应对。她试图掩饰，却只能虚弱地结巴着说。

"T-That's not true…I do have a purpose."  
“那-那不是真的……我有我的使命。”

"Do you really believe that? Gendo lied to us about your origins, so who's to say he didn't lie to you about them either?"  
“你真的相信吗？源堂对我们隐瞒了你的身世，谁又能保证他没有对你撒谎呢？”

Rei paused for a moment. Again she found herself unable to say anything, but this time it was from the shock of hearing him mention her origins. It was a subject brought up only once between her and the director when he explained to her, so she did of course know how she had come into the world. No one else knew though, except for her and Gendo. She had been told if Keel or SEELE found out then it would mean death for her and many others. Was this why Keel was here? Was he here to kill her?  
丽停顿了一下。又一次，她发现自己无法开口，但这次是因为听到他提及她的出身而感到震惊。这个话题只在她和导演之间提起过一次，当时他向她解释了这一切，所以她当然知道自己是如何来到这个世界的。但除了她和源渡之外，没有人知道。她被告知，如果基尔或 SEELE 发现真相，那将意味着她和许多其他人的死亡。这就是基尔来这里的原因吗？他是来杀她的吗？

Rei tried to gather herself together. She turned to him and spoke, trying to maintain her usual voice, "Why are you here?"  
丽试图让自己镇定下来。她转向他，努力保持平常的语气，问道：“你为什么来这里？”

Keel smiled, "Is that a hint of agitation I hear there Rei? I always thought Gendo taught you to suppress those emotions."  
基尔微笑着说：“丽，我听出了一丝不安，是吗？我一直以为源渡教你要压抑这些情绪。”

Not letting him get the better of her, she replied calmly, "I am not agitated, I am just curious as to why you're really here."  
她没有让他占上风，平静地回答：“我并不激动，只是好奇你为何真的在此。”

"If you're worried that I'm here to have you killed then there is nothing to worry about. I've known about you for a long time Ayanami, it's just I'm selective about who I share my information with."  
“如果你担心我是来杀你的，那大可不必。我很久以前就知道你了，绫波，只是我对分享信息很挑剔。”

"So you're lying to the committee?"  
“所以你在对委员会撒谎？”

"I'm not lying to them I'm just withholding the truth. Those fools have no reason to know about your secret, despite Gendo not having a use for you, you're still useful to us. You're a prime example of what we're trying to achieve, the pinnacle of human evolution. To have you killed would be a travesty."  
"我对他们没有撒谎，只是隐瞒了真相。那些傻瓜没有理由知道你的秘密，尽管碇源堂对你已无利用价值，但你对我们仍有用处。你是我们所追求目标的典范，人类进化的巅峰。让你死去将是一种悲剧。"

Rei had never heard herself be referred to like this before, nor did she see herself as such either. Naturally she knew she wasn't normal, she knew what the serum did to her and how her origins played a bit. What struck her as strange though was Keel saying he had a use for her. How could she be of any use to him? She wasn't assigned to NERV anymore nor was she assigned to hunt the angels. That was all Keel wanted to the best of her knowledge.  
绫波从未听过自己被如此称呼，她也不认为自己如此重要。当然，她知道自己不正常，她知道血清对她做了什么，以及她的出身有些特殊。但让她感到奇怪的是，基尔说他有利用她的地方。她能对他有什么用呢？她不再被分配到 NERV，也没有被指派去猎杀天使。据她所知，基尔只想要这些。

"What do you mean you have a use for me?"  
"你说的利用我是什么意思？"

"You're lost Rei, you've been sheltered all of your short life by Ikari because he didn't want you to be human. He wanted you to be a tool and one that benefits only him, now you've ran your course and he's discarded you. You feel like you have no purpose anymore. You feel abandoned and alone in this godless world. What's more you've also been separated from the one you care for."  
"丽，你迷失了，你短暂的一生一直被碇保护着，因为他不想让你成为人类。他想让你成为一个只对他有利的工具，现在你已经完成了使命，他抛弃了你。你觉得自己不再有存在的意义。你感到被遗弃，在这个无神的世界里孤独无依。更糟糕的是，你还与你在乎的那个人分离了。"

"I have not been separated from the dire-"  
"我并没有与那位重要的人分离——"

Keel laughed at her words and interrupted her, "You know I'm not talking about Gendo."  
基尔对她说的话嗤之以鼻，打断道：“你知道我说的不是碇。”

He was referring to Shinji, he had to have been. It was true she had developed some feelings for him. He had been there for her from the start, despite what she had had to do to him he had wanted to protect her, to reach out for her. He was the only one who had ever bothered to do so. "I…"  
他指的肯定是真嗣，一定是。确实，她对真嗣产生了些许感情。从一开始，他就一直在她身边，尽管她对他做了那些事，他仍然想要保护她，向她伸出援手。他是唯一一个真正关心过她的人。“我……”

Sensing she didn't have the words to continue, he continued speaking, "Doesn't it hurt Rei, every time you saw him and Sohryu together. How easily he forgave her after she ran from him and after all she said about him. Wouldn't you like that to change? You know you can make it change. All I want is your assistance in this."  
感觉到她无法继续说下去，他接着说道，“每次看到他和惣流在一起，你不觉得心痛吗，绫波？他那么轻易就原谅了她，尽管她逃离了他，说了那么多关于他的坏话。难道你不希望这一切改变吗？你知道你可以让它改变。我所需要的只是你的帮助。”

"You already have the assistance of NERV, what do you need me for?"  
“NERV 已经提供了帮助，你还需要我做什么？”

"Because I know Gendo is working against me, I know he's hiding things from me and the rest of the committee. Your very existence proves that and the fact that he holds Adam also proves that."  
"因为我知道源堂在暗中与我作对，我知道他在对我们委员会隐瞒事情。你的存在就证明了这一点，而他掌握着亚当的事实也证明了这一点。"

"If the committee knows this then why are they allowing him-"  
"如果委员会知道这一点，那他们为什么还允许他——"

He interrupted her, "The committee doesn't know this and those fools don't need to know at all. They are insignificant. They only want the power for themselves, they don't see what we truly have."  
他打断了她，“委员会并不知道这些，那些傻瓜根本不需要知道。他们微不足道。他们只想要权力为自己所用，看不到我们真正拥有的东西。”

"I do not understand, is the purpose of the project not so that you will all be the new leaders?"  
"我不明白，这个项目的目的是为了让你们成为新的领导者吗？"

"They will not be the leaders of anything, merely the catalyst that triggers the next stage of human evolution. You, on the other hand, you will direct that change. You will help to decide, if you choose to work with me. I could have it so Adam is given back to us by force, or we could save a lot of trouble and you work with us willingly."  
"他们不会成为任何事物的领导者，只是触发人类进化下一阶段的催化剂。而你，另一方面，你将引导这种变化。如果你选择与我合作，你将帮助决定。我可以让亚当被迫回到我们身边，或者我们可以省去很多麻烦，你自愿与我们合作。"

He paused for a moment, "Don't worry though, you don't have to make a decision now. You will have until the final angel. Then I will contact you. I will warn you though if you choose to work against me, then the repercussions will be serious."  
他停顿了一下，"别担心，你不必现在就做决定。你将有直到最后一位天使的时间。然后我会联系你。不过我要警告你，如果你选择与我作对，那么后果将会很严重。"

With those words he began to walk away from her, leaving her to think about what he had just said. She didn't focus on his offer though, instead she focused on what he had said. This feeling she had at that moment, was it loneliness? Was Keel right about it all, had she really just been discarded like a doll or was he just trying to manipulate her? She felt a stray tear roll down her cheek as she thought about it, not really sure why she was crying.  
说完这些话，他开始从她身边走开，留下她去思考他刚刚说的话。然而，她并没有专注于他的提议，而是专注于他说的话。那一刻她感受到的这种感觉，是孤独吗？基尔说得对吗，她真的就像一个被丢弃的玩偶，还是他只是在试图操纵她？她感到一滴泪珠不经意间滑过脸颊，她思考着，并不真正明白自己为何哭泣。

**NERV Offices – 1330 hours  
NERV 总部 – 13 时 30 分**

**Misato's Office 美里办公室**

Shinji leaned back in the seat and placed his coffee cup on the table. That must have been his twelfth cup in the past two days. It was the Nagisa case. They were caught completely unprepared for it and now because of how sensitive the case was they had to work fast and into the night. This had of course meant no or very little sleep for him or Asuka.  
真嗣向后靠在椅背上，将咖啡杯放在桌上。这应该是他过去两天里的第十二杯了。都是因为渚案件。他们对此毫无准备，而现在由于案件的敏感性，他们不得不加班加点，彻夜工作。这自然意味着他和明日香几乎没有或根本没有睡眠。

He was actually starting to feel it as well. His eyes were heavy and all he wanted to do was drop down in the middle of the office and sleep. At least tonight he'd get a break, there was nothing he could do until they got the CCTV footage. He looked over and saw Misato looking at him sympathetically.  
他实际上也开始感受到了。眼皮沉重，他只想在办公室中央倒头就睡。至少今晚他能休息一下，在拿到监控录像之前，他无事可做。他转头看到美里同情地看着他。

"You know I've told you that you can go home, there's nothing for you or Sohryu to do here."  
“你知道我告诉过你，你可以回家，你和惣流在这里也没什么可做的。”

"I know, but Asuka won't let me go home. She says she wants to sort something out here first before we go home." He began to yawn loudly but continued speaking, "that of course was an hour ago."  
"我知道，但明日香不让我回家。她说想先在这里解决一些事情，然后再回去。" 他开始大声打哈欠，但还是继续说着，"当然，那是一个小时前的事了。"

Misato laughed, "So you two are an item now?"  
美里笑了，"那么你们俩现在是一对了？"

"I don't know, I stay there a lot and we're a lot more open with each other but I don't really think we're an item. We haven't really went on any dates or anything. Besides, after what I did I don't think it's a good idea."  
"我不确定，我经常待在那里，我们彼此之间也更加坦诚，但我并不认为我们是一对。我们并没有真正去约会或做什么。而且，在我做了那些事后，我觉得这不是个好主意。"

He hung his head as he remembered what he did that day. Destroying her room was not really something he wanted to be reminded of. Misato walked over and placed her hand on his shoulder, "Asuka told me about that, apparently you caused quite a bit of damage. I guess it was my fault as well."  
他垂下头，回想起那天自己的所作所为。毁掉她的房间，这实在不是他想被提醒的事情。美里走过来，把手放在他的肩上，“明日香告诉我了，看来你造成了不小的破坏。我想这也是我的错。”

Shinji looked up confused, "What do you mean?"  
真嗣困惑地抬起头，“你是什么意思？”

"She came to visit me before the day of the incident and I told her to be harsh with you and to try to get a reaction. Seems that maybe she was a bit too harsh."  
“她在事发前一天来看过我，我告诉她对你严厉些，试图激起你的反应。看来她可能有点过于严厉了。”

Shinji responded with his head hung. He was clearly embarrassed about it. "She doesn't seem angry with me for it, but at the same time I know she isn't exactly pleased. Although I did offer to pay for it all I still don't think she likes sleeping on her own sofa."  
真嗣低着头回应，显然对此感到尴尬。“她看起来并没有因此生我的气，但我知道她并不完全高兴。虽然我提出要支付所有费用，但我仍然觉得她不喜欢自己睡在沙发上。”

Misato laughed, "So where are you sleeping, all cuddled up on the sofa next to her?"  
美里笑道：“那你睡在哪里，蜷缩在沙发旁边吗？”

He shook his head, "No it's not like that. I'm actually on the floor behind the sofa."  
他摇了摇头，“不，不是那样的。我实际上是睡在沙发后面的地板上。”

"So has she forgiven you yet?"  
"她还没原谅你吗？"

"Not yet, why should she forgive me anyway? I don't deserve her forgiveness."  
"还没呢，她为什么要原谅我？我不配得到她的宽恕。"

"Shinji you can't say that, I'm sure she'll forgive you for it or maybe she already has but just hasn't said anything yet. Just…well, as strange as this sounds about someone like Asuka, just be there for her."  
"真嗣，你不能这么想，我相信她会原谅你的，或者她可能已经原谅了，只是还没说出来。总之……虽然这话听起来有点奇怪，但对于像明日香这样的人，只要陪在她身边就好。"

"I'll try." "我会努力的。"

"Good, because you two will have babysitting duties when this is born."  
"好极了，因为你们俩到时候得负责照顾这个小家伙。"

She pointed at her stomach as she spoke. She smiled. Shinji however did not. It wasn't that he wasn't happy for her, it was just that there was still doubt in his mind about it. Doubt that maybe it shouldn't have been there, but nonetheless was. Shinji raised his head and replied, "How did Kaji take the news about that?"  
她边说边指着自己的肚子。她笑了，但真嗣却没有。并非他不为她感到高兴，只是他心中仍有疑虑。或许这疑虑本不该存在，但确实存在。真嗣抬起头回答道：“加持听到这个消息时反应如何？”

"He was shocked at first, we all were, but he was happy."  
"他一开始很震惊，我们大家都是，但他很高兴。"

"I see…" "我明白了…"

Misato noticed the tone of his voice had changed, she responded harshly. "You're having doubts aren't you?"  
美里注意到他的语气变了，她严厉地回应道：“你在怀疑，对吧？”

"Please don't be upset about it, it's just you always told me it was impossible for you to have children and yet you're pregnant. Especially after something like the Bardiel Incident. I'm just concerned that's all."  
“请不要为此生气，只是你一直告诉我你不可能有孩子，但你现在却怀孕了。尤其是在巴迪尔事件之后。我只是担心，仅此而已。”

"Are you saying my baby could be an Angel?"  
“你是说我的孩子可能会是使徒吗？”

"No I'm jus-" "不，我只是——"

She cut him off. She knew she was shouting at him but she didn't care. She felt almost insulted by what he had said. "Look Shinji, people make mistakes alright? Just because I was told that 15 years ago doesn't mean that what they said then wasn't a mistake. Don't start thinking there's something wrong with my baby just because of the timing. I've put up with your beliefs up until now and tried to support you, but I can't believe you'd try to think up something like that."  
她打断了他。她知道自己在大声对他吼，但她不在乎。她几乎觉得他的话侮辱了自己。“听着，真嗣，人都会犯错，对吧？就算十五年前有人那么说过，也不代表他们当时的话就没错。别因为时间点就怀疑我的孩子有问题。我一直忍受你的信仰到现在，并试图支持你，但我真不敢相信你会往那方面想。”

"I'm sorry I didn't mean there was something wrong with it. It's just you were attacked by Bardiel and I'm worried…I guess I'm worried that a part of it remained and it might have infected you."  
“对不起，我不是说孩子有什么问题。只是你被巴迪尔袭击过，我担心……我猜我是担心那东西的一部分残留下来，可能会感染你。”

"Yeah well stop worrying, there is nothing wrong with me or my baby okay, do you understand?"  
"好了，别担心了，我和宝宝都没事，好吗？你明白吗？"

"I understand I'm sorry I just…" he paused, "I don't want anything to happen to you."  
"我明白，对不起，我只是……" 他顿了顿，"我不想你出任何事。"

Misato watched him. Her expression had softened when she noticed a tear rolling down his cheek. She shouldn't have shouted like that, he was only thinking of her and after what had happened to him he had a right to as well.  
美里看着他。当她注意到他脸颊上滚落的一滴泪时，她的表情变得柔和了。她不该那样大喊大叫的，他只是关心她，而且经历了那些事之后，他也有权利这样担心。

She put her arm around him and whispered, "I know, I'm sorry too it's just not easy. I don't want anything to happen to this baby and I don't even want to think about what can happen if something goes wrong."  
她搂住他，低声说：“我知道，我也很难过，只是这并不容易。我不希望这个孩子出任何事，甚至不敢去想如果出了差错会怎样。”

**Shinji/Asuka's Office -1400 hours  
真嗣/明日香办公室 -14 点整**

Asuka exited the elevator and took a few steps towards the office. She paused for a moment, however, when she heard Carter's voice coming from inside. The better part of her was telling her that she shouldn't be eavesdropping in on the conversation, but the more dominant part of her told her to stay out there and to listen to it. This was the side she went with. She didn't like Carter, nor did she trust him. The sooner he had left the better in her eyes.  
明日香走出电梯，向办公室走了几步。然而，当她听到卡特的声音从里面传来时，她停顿了一下。她内心的一部分告诉她不应该偷听这场对话，但更强烈的那部分却告诉她要留在外面，去听一听。她选择了后者。她不喜欢卡特，也不信任他。在她看来，他越早离开越好。

"Yes I understand, I will not need much more time however. I shall be returning soon once I am finished here."  
"是的，我明白，不过我不需要太多时间。我很快就会完成这里的事情，然后回来。"

Asuka breathed a sigh of relief, whoever he was talking to it must have been related to his placement here and that he would be leaving soon. That was one goodbye Asuka couldn't wait to say.  
明日香松了一口气，无论他在和谁说话，这一定与他在这里的安排有关，而且他很快就要离开了。明日香迫不及待地想要说再见。

"They are…not what I expected. I do not understand why there is so much importance placed on them to be honest. Ikari is not held in high regard by his colleagues and Sohryu…well she apparently had a future here but is held with the same respect as Ikari is."  
"他们……并非我所预期的那样。老实说，我不明白为什么他们如此重要。碇真嗣并不受同事们的尊重，而惣流……她虽然在这里有前途，但同样也不被尊重，就像碇真嗣一样。"

The sigh of relief Asuka had breathed before had quicker turned to anger. She had to restrain herself from bursting through the door, instead waiting to see what else Carter had to say. She couldn't believe what he had just said, that people saw her the same way they saw Shinji. That was fine though, she didn't need their respect. She knew her own importance and knew they'd see that soon enough.  
之前松了一口气的明日香，怒火很快又升腾起来。她强忍着冲进门去的冲动，而是选择等待看卡特还有什么要说的。她简直不敢相信他刚刚说的话，那些人居然把她看得和真嗣一样。不过没关系，她不需要他们的尊重。她清楚自己的重要性，知道他们迟早会明白这一点。

"The Nagisa case? It is going as we expected it to go, everything is in my reports including the data I have collected on Sohryu. I am sure you will find it of use."  
“长良案件？正如我们所料，一切都在我的报告中，包括我对惣流收集的数据。我相信你会觉得有用。”

That was her cue, the mention of her name and the proof that she was correct. Carter had been sent here by someone else and was sent to collect date on both her and Shinji. The only question was who? She had to think of how to handle this, Carter didn't know that she had heard this conversation. If she acted too forcefully she might end up not knowing anything. She opened the door and stepped into the office, almost immediately and much to her amusement Carter made an apology and finished speaking on his cell phone.  
这是她的信号，提到她的名字和她正确的证据。卡特是被别人派来的，目的是收集她和真嗣的资料。唯一的问题是谁？她必须考虑如何处理这件事，卡特不知道她已经听到了这段对话。如果她行动过于强硬，可能会一无所获。她推开门走进办公室，几乎立刻，令她感到好笑的是，卡特道了歉并结束了手机通话。

"Agent Carter, I hope I wasn't interrupting anything important."  
"卡特特工，希望我没有打断什么重要的事情。"

"Just a call from my colleagues, they want progress reports. That's all."  
"只是同事的电话，他们要进度报告。就这些。"

She questioned him, bluntly. "So tell me again, why exactly are you here?"  
她直截了当地问他。"那么再告诉我一次，你究竟为什么来这里？"

He replied arrogantly, "Haven't we already been through this? I was assigned by my government to ensure NERV doesn't screw up on finding Nagisa. I'm sure you're aware of the implications it could have on the world if he is not recovered safely, or has your own concern for your own life and Ikari's blinded you to what you should be doing?"  
他傲慢地回答道：“我们不是已经讨论过这个问题了吗？我被政府指派来确保 NERV 不会在寻找渚薰的事情上出岔子。如果他不能安全找回，世界将会面临怎样的后果，你肯定清楚。还是说，你对自己和碇的安危的担忧让你忽视了应该做的事情？”

Asuka desperately wanted to punch him. Everything he said just seemed to irritate her. It was as if he was trying to do this on purpose. She responded confidently, "So you don't think me and Ikari can handle it, well look you just watch us deal with it and make sure you don't get in our way."  
明日香真想揍他一顿。他说的每句话都让她感到烦躁。就好像他是故意这么做的。她自信地回应道：“所以你不认为我和碇能处理好这件事，那你就看着吧，我们会搞定一切，确保你别挡我们的路。”

"So arrogant, didn't your mother ever-"  
"“如此傲慢，你母亲从未教过你——”

Asuka snapped, she dashed towards him and pinned him up against the wall snarling. She spat out angrily, "Don't you ever…fucking mention my mother again, do you understand?"  
明日香厉声喝道，猛地冲向他，将他按在墙上咆哮。她愤怒地吐出话语，“你他妈的再敢提我母亲试试，听明白了吗？”

She let go of him and stormed out of the room. He looked at the door with a cocky grin and spoke to himself.  
她松开手，怒气冲冲地离开了房间。他看着门，嘴角勾起一抹得意的笑，自言自语道。

"I understand Sohryu, you'd better watch that temper though. You might wind up not making it to the fifteenth…"  
“我明白了，惣流，你最好还是控制一下那脾气。否则，你可能撑不到第十五天……”

**Asuka's Residence – 2350 hours  
明日香的家——23 时 50 分**

Shinji lay awake and looked up at the ceiling feeling very much like irony had slapped him across the face. He had spent the last day begging for sleep and the past few days begging for the chance to just sit down and have a rest. Now, when that chance did come, he found himself unable to even close his eyes.  
真嗣躺在床上，抬头望着天花板，感觉命运的讽刺像一记耳光狠狠打在他脸上。过去一天里，他苦苦祈求着睡眠；而前几天，他只希望能有机会坐下来稍作休息。如今，当这个机会真的来临时，他却发现自己连闭上眼睛都做不到。

Everything was weighing heavily on his mind, Misato's baby, Kaworou Nagisa, Asuka, Touji, his father, the colonization. It was all there each time he closed his eyes, entering his mind and not allowing him to get to sleep. Then there were the piles of flat pack furniture lying at his feet still boxed up. The sight of those definitely did not help ease his mind, only serve as a constant reminder of what he had done.  
一切重担都压在他的心头，美里姐的孩子、渚薰、明日香、剑介、父亲、殖民计划……每次他闭上眼，这些思绪便涌入脑海，让他无法入睡。还有那些散落在他脚边的扁平包装家具，依旧未拆封。这些景象无疑加剧了他的焦虑，不断提醒着他所做的一切。

'_I'll have to sort those out for her this weekend, it's the least I can do.'_  
'这周末我得帮她整理那些东西，这是我起码能做的。'

He closed his eyes and tried again to get back to sleep. Behind him he could hear Asuka shifting slightly on the sofa. He was concerned about her. She had come in a lot later than he had expected, when he asked why she just blanked him. He could tell something was wrong. One thing he had learnt was that Asuka was good at hiding her feelings and not letting people know she was upset. The day she learnt about her mother's involvement in the Evangelion Project and the past thirty days had proven that. The only problem was her reluctance to admit it or to accept help. Even then, Shinji didn't know what to do to help her without angering her further.  
他闭上眼睛，再次尝试入睡。在他身后，他能听到明日香在沙发上微微挪动的声音。他很担心她。她回来的时间比他预想的要晚得多，当他问起原因时，她只是对他置之不理。他能感觉到有什么不对劲。他学到的一件事是，明日香擅长隐藏自己的情绪，不让别人知道她难过。自从她得知母亲参与了 EVA 计划以及过去的三十天里，这一点已经得到了证明。唯一的问题是她不愿承认，也不愿接受帮助。即便如此，真嗣也不知道该如何在不进一步激怒她的情况下帮助她。

She shifted again, this time whimpering slightly. Shinji opened his eyes and stared up at the ceiling.  
她再次挪动，这次轻轻地呜咽了一声。真嗣睁开眼睛，盯着天花板。

'_I never really considered anyone else in the past few months. I never really considered how what we did affected anyone else, my ideas, my thoughts, my worries I was only thinking about myself so that I wasn't hurt by something happening to someone. I didn't really think about her either, Asuka has been hit hard by this. She found out her mother was involved just like I did, but I was more concerned with feeling guilt for that.'_  
“这几个月来，我从未真正考虑过其他人。我从未真正考虑过我们的所作所为如何影响他人，我的想法，我的忧虑，我只想着自己，以免被某人的遭遇所伤害。我也没有真正想过她，明日香在这件事上受到了沉重打击。她发现她母亲也牵涉其中，就像我一样，但我更关心的是为此感到内疚。”

Asuka shifted again and Shinji heard her whimpering again. This time louder, almost like she was crying. He got up slowly and made his way around to her. In the moonlight he could make out her face and form. She was sleeping still, but had begun to shift around a lot like she was having a bad nightmare. Shinji positioned himself nearby and whispered.  
明日香再次挪动身体，真嗣又听到了她的呜咽声。这次声音更大，几乎像是在哭泣。他慢慢起身，绕到她身边。在月光下，他能看清她的脸和身形。她仍在熟睡，但开始频繁地翻来覆去，好像在做噩梦。真嗣靠近她，轻声说道。

"Asuka…are you alright?" “明日香…你还好吗？”

He received no response. Of course, he hadn't really expect an answer. He took a deep breath and moved around to the front of the sofa and knelt down beside her. She was still moving around, not really thrashing around violently but still enough to cause him concern. He placed a hand gently on her shoulder and whispered again this time a bit louder then before.  
他没有得到回应。当然，他并没有真的期待会有答案。他深吸一口气，绕到沙发前，跪在她身边。她仍在动来动去，虽然没有剧烈挣扎，但足以引起他的担忧。他轻轻地将手放在她的肩膀上，这次比之前稍微提高了些声音，再次低语。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

Again no response from her. Shinji considered giving up and trying to go to sleep again, but he couldn't leave her like this. In the pale moonlight he could see tears forming in her eyes yet he knelt there frozen still. Asuka whimpered again this time though Shinji felt his blood run cold with her words.  
她依然没有回应。真嗣考虑放弃，再次尝试入睡，但他不能就这样丢下她不管。在苍白的月光下，他看到她眼中涌出泪水，而他却跪在那里，僵住了。明日香再次发出呜咽声，这一次，真嗣听到她的话，感到血液都凝固了。

"Mama…no…don't leave…I'll die with you I promise."  
“妈妈……不……别离开……我答应和你一起死。”

Shinji's eyes widened when she said that. He placed a hand on her again and began shaking her again, trying to get her to wake up. He didn't care what she did to him when she woke only that she would be out of that terrible nightmare.  
听到她这么说，真嗣的眼睛瞪大了。他再次把手放在她身上，开始摇晃她，试图让她醒来。他不在乎她醒来后会对他做什么，只希望她能摆脱那个可怕的噩梦。

"Asuka please, wake up." “明日香，请醒醒。”

He felt her grab his arm and pull him towards her, her eyes flickered open suddenly as she shouted mother loudly. She sat up and looked around frantically trying to discern if she was awake or still trapped in that horrible nightmare. She suddenly became aware of Shinji's presence next to her and her holding his hand firmly. He spoke to her quietly.  
他感觉到她抓住他的手臂，将他拉向她，她的眼睛突然睁开，大声喊着妈妈。她坐起身来，慌乱地环顾四周，试图分辨自己是醒着还是仍被困在那可怕的噩梦中。她突然意识到真嗣就在她身边，紧紧握着他的手。他轻声对她说道。

"Asuka you were….you were having a bad dream."  
"明日香，你刚才……在做噩梦。"

She didn't speak. Instead she just gripped his hand tightly. As she remembered the dream she felt a tear roll down her cheek. She had seen it again, the same moment she had seen over twenty years ago. The scene that haunted her, that hung over her and threatened her. She tried to speak but only found herself bursting into tears. From her sitting position she wrapped her arms around Shinji and sobbed into his shoulder.  
她没有说话，只是紧紧握住他的手。当她回想起那个梦时，一滴泪珠滑过她的脸颊。她再次看到了那个场景，那个二十多年来一直萦绕在她心头的瞬间。那个困扰她、笼罩她、威胁她的画面。她试图开口，却只能失声痛哭。她从坐着的姿势伸出双臂，紧紧抱住真嗣，将脸埋在他的肩头抽泣。

"Shinji promise me…" "真嗣，答应我……"

She sobbed loudly and tried to regain her composure, "…promise me you'll never leave me."  
她大声啜泣，试图恢复镇定，“……答应我，你永远不会离开我。”

He held her against him and whispered into her ear, "I won't ever leave you, I promise."  
他将她拥入怀中，对着她的耳朵低语，“我不会离开你，我保证。”

### Chapter 23 Turn to the Light

_26__th_ _August 2015_ 2015 年 8 月 26 日

**NERV Offices – 1015 hours  
NERV 总部 —— 10 点 15 分**

Shinji almost wished he hadn't requested the footage from the Marduk Institute. Sitting there looking over the same parts repeatedly, scrutinizing every detail just looking for something that would be out of place. Next to him he heard Asuka yawning as he continued to look over the footage.  
真嗣几乎希望自己没有要求从马尔杜克研究所获取录像。坐在那里一遍遍地审视相同的片段，仔细检查每一个细节，只为寻找任何不寻常的地方。他听到旁边的明日香打着哈欠，而他继续审视着录像。

The particular piece he was looking at was from the day of, or at least the suspected day of, Nagisa's disappearance. Shinji watched it again as the three people entered Nagisa's office, the three people he was scheduled to meet with. Two women and a man entering, then ten minutes later leaving. There was nothing strange about that at all.  
他正在查看的那段录像来自，或者至少疑似来自，渚失踪的那一天。真嗣再次观看，画面中三个人进入了渚的办公室，正是他预定要会见的那三人。两名女性和一个男人进入，十分钟后离开。这一切并无任何异常之处。

Frustrated, he ejected the tape and reached for the one of Nagisa's office. The same one they had viewed prior to the current selection. Behind him he heard Agent Carter sighing in annoyance.  
他感到沮丧，于是取出录像带，换上了另一盘，是渚办公室的录像。正是他们之前看过的那盘。在他身后，他听到卡特探员不耐烦地叹了口气。

"Mr. Ikari, if we've viewed it several times already and found nothing, then what do you expect to find the next time we view it?"  
“碇先生，如果我们已经反复看过多次，却一无所获，那么你期望下一次能看到什么呢？”

Shinji tried to stay calm, usually he would have been hard pressed to find a response but due to his lack of sleep and current caffeine dependency he was finding it incredibly easy to get wound up. Especially when the person was Carter.  
真嗣试图保持冷静，通常情况下他很难找到回应的方式，但由于缺乏睡眠和当前对咖啡因的依赖，他发现自己很容易被激怒。尤其是当对方是卡特时。

"We can't discount that these tapes have been altered in some way or that we missed a minor detail, Carter."  
“我们不能排除这些录像带被篡改的可能性，或者我们遗漏了某个细节，卡特。”

"Like what? Are you expecting to find him reaching for a communicator and asking Scotty to beam him up? Face it Ikari, we're at a dead end, we should be looking at other possibilities than your silly theories."  
“比如什么？你难道指望发现他在伸手拿通讯器，然后向斯科蒂请求传送他上去吗？面对现实吧，碇，我们已经走投无路了，我们应该考虑其他可能性，而不是你那些荒谬的理论。”

'_If only you knew what was truly happening on this world, would you be so quick to discount me then, you son of a bitch?'_ Shinji thought to himself angrily. What was Carter trying to prove by discouraging him all the time? Shinji already knew he was right, Asuka knew the truth, Carter's words were just insignificant to him but still every time Carter spoke them Shinji couldn't help but feel a bit discouraged.  
‘要是你知道这个世界真正发生了什么，你还会这么轻易地否定我吗，你这个混蛋？’ 真嗣愤怒地心想。卡特一直试图证明什么来打击他？真嗣已经知道自己是对的，明日香也知道真相，卡特的话对他来说微不足道，但每次卡特说这些话时，真嗣还是忍不住感到有些沮丧。

"What other possibilities are there Carter? A guy vanishes in the middle of his office in broad daylight. There are no signs of intrusion, the security footage appears to be spotless and no one aside from the people he was scheduled to meet are seen entering the building and you're the only one who thinks there's a rational explanation. So what exactly are you suggesting happened? You seem to be under the impression he was kidnapped by international terrorists, so what were they? Invisible?"  
“卡特，还有其他可能吗？一个人在光天化日之下从办公室里消失。没有入侵的迹象，监控录像看起来毫无破绽，除了他预定要见的人之外，没有人进入大楼，而你却是唯一一个认为有合理解释的人。那么你到底在暗示发生了什么？你似乎认为他是被国际恐怖分子绑架了，那么他们是什么？隐形的吗？”

Carter replied back his voice scathing, "Don't be ridiculous Ikari, we're dealing with something that has been planned down to the most minuscule detail. If you had any sense you'-"  
卡特尖刻地回答道：“别荒谬了，碇，我们面对的是一个计划得极其周密的行动。如果你有任何理智的话，你——”

He was cut off by Asuka shouting from her seat, both he and Shinji had forgotten she was there and she did not look pleased. "Can you both please shut up and stop acting like children. Don't we have more important things to worry about than you two arguing, like finding Nagisa?"  
他话音未落，就被坐在座位上的明日香大声打断，他和真嗣都忘了她还在那里，而她看起来并不高兴。“你们俩能不能闭嘴，别再像小孩子一样吵了。我们不是有更重要的事情要担心吗，比如找到渚？”

"Well then you had better tell Ikari to get out of his dream world and focus on reality."  
“既然如此，你最好告诉碇，让他从他的梦境世界中走出来，专注于现实。”

With those words Carter turned and left the office, Shinji felt Asuka squeezing his hand as he sighed. Dejected he looked at the screen before pausing it and speaking to Asuka, "Sorry I-"  
说完这些话，卡特转身离开了办公室，真嗣感到明日香握紧了他的手，他叹了口气。沮丧地看着屏幕，暂停了画面，对明日香说：“对不起，我——”

"Don't apologize, he's an obnoxious bastard anyway."  
"别道歉了，反正他本来就是个讨厌的混蛋。"

"There's something about him Asuka, I don't know what it is but I…"  
"他身上有些东西，Asuka，我不知道是什么，但我……"

Shinji trailed off trying to find the right words for what he wanted to say. He couldn't really think of what he meant. There was something about Carter, something that gave him a bad feeling deep inside. Since the first time they had met it had been there and Carter's reason for being here didn't seem to make sense to him either. He couldn't help but feel that Carter had a different motive for being there than what they knew.  
真嗣话说到一半，试图找到合适的词来表达他想说的。他其实不太清楚自己想表达什么。卡特身上有些东西，让他内心深处有种不好的感觉。自从他们第一次见面以来，这种感觉就一直存在，而且卡特来这里的原因对他来说也毫无意义。他不禁觉得，卡特来这里的动机与他们所知道的不同。

Before he could finish speaking Asuka began to speak, "I know what you mean, it's almost as if he's here to check on us rather than to help us in this case."  
还没等他说完，明日香就开始说道：“我明白你的意思，他来这里似乎更多的是为了监视我们，而不是帮助我们解决这个案子。”

Shinji nodded in agreement, but at the same time was surprised that Asuka was of a similar opinion to him, "It doesn't make sense though. Who would send him?"  
真嗣点头表示同意，但同时也惊讶于明日香和他有相同的看法，“这说不通啊。谁会派他来呢？”

"I don't know but…well yesterday I caught him talking on his phone to someone, I don't know who. At first I thought it was his superiors but the conversation sounded much stronger than a friendly update. He also mentioned data collection on us."  
“我不知道，但……昨天我无意中听到他在电话里和某人交谈，不知道是谁。起初我以为是他上司，但对话听起来比简单的汇报要严肃得多。他还提到了对我们进行数据收集。”

Shinji looked at her strangely. At the mention of data collection he questioned her, his voice almost accusing her, "What do you mean data collection? How come you didn't mention this yesterday?"  
真嗣奇怪地看着她。一提到数据收集，他就质问她，语气几乎是在指责，“你说的数据收集是什么意思？昨天你怎么没提这事？”

"I…" She trailed off before responding, seeming somewhat annoyed by the tone of his voice, "Look don't blame me for not saying anything, it just slipped my mind yesterday okay…"  
“我……”她话说到一半就停住了，似乎对他的语气有些不悦，“别怪我没说，昨天只是忘了提而已……”

She looked away from him back at the screen. The memory of last night had come back to him. The nightmare she had and how she sobbed into his shoulder. He had never seen her like that before.  
她转过头去，目光回到屏幕上。昨晚的记忆涌上心头。她的噩梦，以及她如何在他肩头啜泣。他从未见过她那样。

"Asuka…did something happen between you two yesterday?"  
"明日香…你们俩昨天是不是发生了什么事？"

She responded quickly, her voice stern, "I don't want to talk about it Shinji."  
她迅速回应，语气严厉，"我不想谈这个，真嗣。"

He persisted trying to find out more, "Was it related to the night-"  
他坚持试图了解更多，"是不是和昨晚有关——"

"I said…" She paused, "I don't want to talk about it, please, not here at least."  
"我说了…" 她顿了顿，"我不想谈这个，拜托，至少别在这里。"

Shinji sighed, "Okay, fine. I won't persist."  
真嗣叹了口气，"好吧，行。我不会再追问了。"

She turned to him, her voice softer than before but still showing her agitation, "Don't take it personally, I just…I don't want to remember that okay."  
她转向他，声音比之前柔和，但仍显露出她的烦躁，"别往心里去，我只是…我不想再回忆那些，好吗？"

"Okay, I understand." "好的，我明白了。"

Shinji turned around and pressed play on the tape, the footage of the meeting room began to play again. Nagisa and the three others were positioned around the table. This was his last known location. If anything was going to be found, Shinji at least hoped it would be here. Unfortunately for him, this did not appear to be the case. He sighed again and got up. Much to his surprise though, Asuka grabbed his hand and pulled him back down.  
真嗣转过身，按下了播放键，会议室的录像再次开始播放。渚和另外三个人围坐在桌旁。这是他最后已知的位置。如果有什么线索要被发现，真嗣至少希望是在这里。不幸的是，这似乎并非如此。他再次叹了口气，站起身来。然而，令他惊讶的是，明日香抓住了他的手，将他拉了回来。

"What is it?" “怎么了？”

"Look." "看。"

She took the pen she was holding and pointed it at the screen, more importantly at Nagisa's desk. On it was an ornament with markings on it. Shinji had never seen it before, but assumed it was just a gift Nagisa had been given over the years as head of Marduk.  
她拿起手中的笔，指向屏幕，更确切地说是指向渚薰的桌面。上面有一个带有标记的装饰品。真嗣以前从未见过它，但猜测这可能是渚薰多年来作为马尔杜克组织负责人所收到的礼物。

Asuka continued speaking, "The first time we watched this that caught my eye for some reason. I wasn't really sure where I had seen it before, but now I just remembered."  
明日香继续说道，“我们第一次看这个的时候，不知为何它引起了我的注意。我不太确定之前在哪里见过，但现在我刚刚想起来了。”

Surprised at the discovery he asked her, "Where?"  
他对这一发现感到惊讶，问她：“在哪里？”

"It's was on the entrance to the hatch I rescued you from, after Leliel."  
"那是在我救你出来的舱门入口处，在 Leliel 之后。"

**Tokyo 3 Park – 1130 hours  
东京 3 号公园 – 1130 时**

Kaji sat down next to the old man and looked around. In his hand he was clutching a series of documents and the usual smile on his face was not there. For some reason he was nervous about this meeting, but he didn't fear for his life, rather than for that of others involved.  
加持坐在老人旁边，环顾四周。他手里紧握着一叠文件，脸上惯常的微笑不见了。不知为何，他对这次会面感到紧张，但并不担心自己的生命安全，而是担心其他相关人的安危。

He was worried that the outcome of today would affect things in a way he had never imagined when he agreed to this. So much had changed compared to what he had known, Misato's pregnancy, Asuka and Shinji's relationship, Nagisa vanishing. None of it was meant to happen and yet it was. It had thrown him off track, away from what he really wanted to do.  
他担心今天的结局会影响事情的发展，这是他在同意参与时未曾预料到的。与他所知的相比，变化太大了，美里怀孕了，明日香和真嗣的关系，渚薰的消失。这些都不应该发生，但它们确实发生了。这让他偏离了轨道，远离了他真正想做的事情。

Beside him he heard Fuyutsuki clearing his voice and finally speaking, "You're nervous Kaji, usually that's my position."  
他旁边听到冬月清了清嗓子，终于开口说道，"你紧张了，加治，通常这是我的位置。"

Kaji chuckled, "I'm nervous before every meeting like this, I just don't let it show. Guess it's all starting to catch up with me now."  
加治轻笑道，"每次这样的会议前我都会紧张，只是不表现出来。猜想现在这一切开始追上我了。"

Fuyutsuki laughed, "I see. You're starting to get old if you're letting it show Kaji, maybe it's time to settle down and stop taking risks like this."  
冬月笑了，“我明白了。如果你开始让这种情绪外露，加治，或许是你开始变老的迹象，也许是时候安定下来，别再冒这种险了。”

Kaji frowned, "The risk would be in sitting back and doing nothing. Surely you can understand that."  
加治皱眉，“无所作为才是真正的风险。你肯定能理解这一点。”

"I can understand, but then again I'm not in your position. You, however, have increased responsibilities now and playing double agent won't do you any favors. You know how hard the committee can be on people they consider to be a risk or unimportant to them."  
“我能理解，但话说回来，我不是你的位置。你现在责任更重了，当双重间谍对你没有任何好处。你知道委员会对那些他们认为有风险或不重要的人有多严厉。”

Kaji grinned and responded, "Oh I understand, that's why I don't investigate them or make any contact with them except for obtaining Adam. Keel is a powerful man whose motives are known only to him, I'm sure not even the rest of committee are certain of what he wants."  
加持咧嘴一笑，回应道：“哦，我明白，这就是为什么我只获取亚当，不调查他们或与他们接触。基尔是一个权力极大的男人，他的动机只有他自己知道，我敢肯定，就连委员会的其他成员也不确定他想要什么。”

Fuyutsuki thought about it for a moment. As much as he didn't want to admit it, Kaji was correct. Without Kaji they wouldn't have gotten to this stage, but at the same time the death of a trusted friend was not something he wanted to go through at this moment, "So much has changed to what was planned, Ikari has had to take drastic measures to switch it back in our direction, even pulling Ayanami from NERV to make way for SEELE's gift. The doubts I had when this began have increased, I know Ikari only wants…well I don't want to bore you with the details."  
冬月沉思片刻。尽管他不愿承认，但加持说得没错。没有加持，他们无法达到这一步，但与此同时，失去一位信任的朋友是他此刻不愿经历的，“计划已经发生了太多变化，碇已经不得不采取极端措施来扭转局面，甚至将绫波从 NERV 调走，为 SEELE 的礼物腾出位置。从一开始我就有的疑虑现在更加深了，我知道碇只想要……好吧，我不想用细节来烦你。”

Kaji nodded, "I know and that's why I need to continue to prepare the others, even if we do succeed, SEELE or Keel are just going to strike back with even more force. The more I learn now will prepare us for what happens. You're right though, what was planned or the information given to me by you and Ikari has changed. We even have to deal with things that we didn't realize would come into the picture."  
加持点头道：“我明白，这就是为什么我需要继续准备其他人，即使我们成功了，SEELE 或基尔也会以更大的力量反击。我现在学得越多，就越能为我们即将面对的情况做好准备。不过你说得对，原计划或你和碇提供给我的信息已经发生了变化。我们甚至不得不处理一些原本没预料到会浮现的问题。”

Fuyutsuki agreed, "Nagisa for example. And for some reason the committee seems to be showing quite a bit of interest in this one. They even assigned a new Agent to us, Agent Carter, to track him down. I trust your digging has found something."  
冬月同意道：“比如长良。不知为何，委员会似乎对这个孩子表现出相当大的兴趣。他们甚至指派了一位新特工给我们，卡特特工，专门负责追踪他。我相信你的调查已经有所发现。”

"Nothing on Nagisa, he is clean as far as I can tell. A little bit too clean, however, his records are pretty scattered. He jumped around from place to place as a child and went to many schools. Didn't really have a chance to settle in any one area. He was fourteen the day the impact occurred…" Kaji paused for the moment, "…and within six years he had a prominent position at the top of Marduk."  
“关于长良，我目前没发现什么问题，他看起来干净得过分。不过，他的档案相当零散。他小时候四处漂泊，上过很多学校，没有真正在任何一个地方安定下来。他十四岁那年发生了冲击事件……”加持顿了顿，“……六年内，他就登上了马尔杜克会的高层位置。”

"Of course, I remember. It was that year's big success story. Marduk had already made its name and appointing Nagisa was a big step for it. It was part of their idea of looking towards the future. Appointing a twenty year old was a big risk for them but with the state of the country back then it wasn't a surprise."  
"当然，我记得。那是那一年的大成功故事。Marduk 已经声名鹊起，任命 Nagisa 对他们来说是一个重大举措。这是他们面向未来理念的一部分。任命一个二十岁的年轻人对他们来说是个大风险，但考虑到当时国家的状况，这并不令人意外。"

"It was still unusual though, this guy Nagisa comes from nowhere to head one of Japan's fastest growing corporations. A corporation that at that point was recognized by the UN and doing work all over the world."  
"尽管如此，这仍然很不寻常，这个叫 Nagisa 的家伙从无名之辈一跃成为日本发展最快的公司之一的负责人。这家公司在那时已被联合国认可，并在全球范围内开展工作。"

"Yes, but no one seemed to question it, how they got that support or why someone so young was there, as far as they were concerned Nagisa was a good person."  
"是的，但似乎没有人质疑这一点，他们是如何获得这种支持的，或者为什么一个如此年轻的人会出现在那里，就他们所知，Nagisa 是个好人。"

"He was, that's why I couldn't find anything on him and that's why his disappearance like this makes no sense. Instead of looking into Nagisa's background I began looking into the history of Marduk instead."  
"他确实如此，这就是为什么我找不到他的任何信息，也是为什么他这样消失毫无道理。我没有去调查渚的背景，而是开始研究马杜克的历史。"

"Of course, and I'm guessing you found something of importance there."  
"当然，我猜你在那里发现了什么重要的东西。"

"Naturally, Marduk was backed by one hundred and eight organizations from all over the world when it started off. It received funding from each one of those corporations, again nothing too strange. For a business to start up it needs funding, but one hundred and eight seems a bit excessive…"  
"自然，马杜克在起步时得到了来自全球一百零八个组织的支持。它从每一个这样的公司获得了资金，这本身并不奇怪。一个企业要启动需要资金，但一百零八个似乎有点过分……"

He opened the file and turned to a list of businesses, "I investigated a few of the businesses, each one shut down late two thousand and two. No one noticed of course because they were located in literally every area of the world."  
他打开文件，翻到一份企业名单，“我调查了几家企业，它们都在 2002 年末关闭。当然，没人注意到，因为它们遍布世界各地。”

"Which means they were…?"  
“这意味着它们是……？”

Kaji finished off the sentence for him, "Dummy Companies set up with the sole purpose of backing the Marduk Institute and funding it until it was safe. Then they all close down and are forgotten about, they didn't do anything they were just there."  
加治替他补完了句子，“空壳公司，设立的唯一目的是支持马杜克研究所，为其提供资金，直到研究所安全为止。然后它们全部关闭，被遗忘，它们什么也没做，只是存在过。”

"No one noticed?" "没人注意到吗？"

"No, Marduk was already in the public's eye by then. It had more than enough investors from legit companies for people to notice the dummy companies slipping away. Of course if anyone had bothered to look into it they would notice the same people on the board of each company."  
"没有，那时马杜克已经在公众视野中了。它有足够多的合法公司投资者，以至于人们不会注意到那些傀儡公司悄悄溜走。当然，如果有人费心去调查一下，他们会发现每家公司的董事会成员都是同一批人。"

Fuyutsuki frowned and responded, "SEELE…"  
冬月皱了皱眉，回应道："Seele……"

He nodded again, "Correct, along with many ex-members of GEHIRN."  
他再次点头，“没错，还有许多 GEHIRN 的前成员。”

"So that means Marduk is just another part of the project, as we suspected?"  
“那么，这意味着 Marduk 只是我们怀疑的项目的另一部分？”

"It seems to, but I don't know its connection. And as for Nagisa's disappearance…it doesn't make any sense as to why he'd go."  
“看起来是这样，但我不知道它与项目的联系。至于渚的失踪……他为何离开，这一点毫无头绪。”

Fuyutsuki warned him, "I will advise you not to dig any further. Leave it to the Agents we have assigned. I will ensure this information reaches the right people. I would also like you to pass on a message to Agent Katsuragi."  
冬月警告他，“我劝你不要再深究下去。交给我们的特工处理吧。我会确保这些信息传到正确的人手中。我还希望你给碇特工带个话。”

"What message would that be?"  
“什么话？”

"Tell her 'congratulations.'"  
“告诉她‘恭喜’。”

**Ship Crash site - 1315  
船只失事现场 - 1315**

Shinji stepped out of the car, the hot sun glaring down on him. This was the first time he had seen this place since being rescued by Asuka. This was also the first time he had been able to see this place for himself without being drugged up. The memories of the night were there, but fragmented. He remembered everything about what Keel had shown him while he was plugged into that strange alien device. He remembered Asuka rescuing him and then being shown what SEELE was trying to achieve.  
真嗣走下车，炽热的阳光直射而下。这是他自被明日香救出后第一次来到这个地方。这也是他第一次在没有药物影响的情况下亲自探访此地。那一夜的记忆犹存，但支离破碎。他记得自己在那个奇怪的外星装置中被接入时，基尔向他展示的一切。他记得明日香救了他，然后向他展示了 SEELE 试图达成的目标。

He found it hard to believe how something like that could go buried here for all that time without anyone even noticing. Although he didn't even know how long it had been buried there, he had to ask himself if it was only there for the purpose of his capture or had it been there for much longer? Were there more of them out there? The thought of that scared him, that there could be more of those out there around the world. They could just attack at any time and that would be it, all over for humanity and it would all be over for them.  
他难以置信，如此重大的事件竟能在此地被埋藏这么久而不为人知。尽管他甚至不知道它被埋藏了多久，他不得不问自己，这是否仅仅是为了抓捕他而设，还是已经存在了更长时间？是否还有更多类似的存在？想到这些让他感到恐惧，世界上可能还有更多这样的存在。它们随时可能发动攻击，那样的话，人类的一切就都结束了，对他们来说一切都结束了。

Shinji heard Asuka calling across to him, "What's wrong, Shinji?"  
真嗣听到明日香从对面喊他，“怎么了，真嗣？”

He turned and shook his head, "Nothing, I was just…thinking…"  
他转过身摇摇头，“没什么，我只是……在想事情……”

She closed her car door and moved next to him, "Well while you're thinking start searching as well, they've probably cleared up most of the debris by now but I'm sure they can't have cleared everything up."  
她关上车门，走到他身边，“既然你在想事情，那就顺便开始找找吧，他们现在应该已经清理掉大部分碎片了，但我肯定还有没清理干净的地方。”

"Right…" “对……”

Asuka took him and showed him where the entrance to the ship had been, there was nothing but sand there anymore. No traces of the ship remained, but for some reason Shinji felt like there was something there.  
明日香带着他，指给他看飞船入口曾经所在的地方，那里现在只剩下沙子了。飞船的痕迹已荡然无存，但不知为何，真嗣觉得那里似乎有什么东西。

Asuka sighed, "Looks like it's going to be a tough one, I forgot how long it had been since we were here. They could have cleared it up and buried a new one here by now if they wanted."  
明日香叹了口气，“看来这会是个棘手的任务，我忘了我们上次来这里已经过去多久了。如果他们愿意，可能已经清理干净并在这里埋下了新的入口。”

Shinji reassured her, "There's something here, we'll find it."  
真嗣安慰她，“这里有些东西，我们会找到的。”

"I hope so, otherwise you're going to be in for a long night."  
“希望如此，否则你可要熬个通宵了。”

Shinji nodded in agreement before realizing what she had just said, he looked up at her strangely, noticing she was grinning widely, "What do you mean I'll be in for a long night?"  
真嗣点头表示同意，随即意识到她刚才的话，他奇怪地抬头看她，注意到她正咧嘴大笑，“你说的我会有个长夜是什么意思？”

"Well you don't expect someone as beautiful as me to sift through all this sand looking for pieces of a rusty alien craft do you?"  
"哎呀，你总不会指望像我这么美的人去筛遍所有这些沙子，寻找生锈的外星飞船碎片吧？"

"Well I…" He sighed, "I guess not…"  
"嗯，我…" 他叹了口气，"我想不会吧…"

Asuka knelt down and prodded him playfully, "You give up too easily Shinji, of course I'm going to help it's just I'm…not really sure how we should start this. Hell I'm not even sure I believe we're doing this…"  
明日香蹲下来，俏皮地戳了戳他，"你放弃得太快了，真嗣，我当然会帮忙，只是…我不太确定我们应该怎么开始。见鬼，我甚至不确定自己是否相信我们真的在做这件事…"

"Asuka…what was it like…"  
"明日香…那是什么感觉…"

"What are you talking about?"  
“你在说什么？”

This time it was Shinji's turn to grin, "Being wrong for a change?"  
这次轮到真嗣咧嘴笑了，"偶尔错一次的感觉？"

She frowned at him, "Shut up."  
她皱眉看着他，"闭嘴。"

"Sorry." "对不起。"

She sighed and began to explain to him, "It stung if you must know, to have what I thought I believed turn around and kicked right back at me. It was more about pride than anything, I believed so much I was right and you weren't, even with each Angel we faced I was still so convinced. Then I saw the lights over where Leliel captured you, I saw the craft moving overhead as its lights bore down on me Shinji…but I still didn't believe it."  
她叹了口气，开始向他解释，“如果你非要知道的话，那种感觉就像是我以为自己坚信的东西突然转过身来狠狠踢了我一脚。这更多的是关于自尊，我坚信自己是对的，而你错了，即使在我们面对每一个使徒时，我依然如此确信。然后我看到了 Leliel 抓走你时上空的光，我看到了那飞行器在头顶移动，它的灯光直射向我，真嗣……但我仍然没有相信。”

She paused for a moment, not even sure why she was telling him all this. Admitting she was wrong to him, admitting how it hurt her pride, this wasn't something she usually spoke about. She didn't share feelings like this, it was weakness, yet for some reason it was comforting for her. Regardless, she continued speaking.  
她停顿了一下，甚至不确定为什么要告诉他这一切。向他承认自己错了，承认这伤害了她的自尊，这不是她通常会谈论的事情。她不分享这样的感受，这是软弱的表现，然而出于某种原因，这让她感到安慰。尽管如此，她继续说道。

"Then…well, you know what happened when you were away. What I said about you, that you deserved it and it was your own fault. You were right and I wasn't and I had to deal with that and I just took it out on everyone. Then I came here and I saw another one of those crafts with my own eyes, I stepped inside one and I saw the alien symbols, the device they had you hooked up to and then…well you know what we both saw then."  
“然后……好吧，你知道你不在时发生了什么。我对你说的话，说你活该，那是你自己的错。你是对的，我错了，我必须面对这一点，我只是把气撒在每个人身上。然后我来到这里，亲眼看到了另一艘那样的飞行器，我走进其中一艘，看到了外星符号，他们把你连接到的那台设备，然后……好吧，你知道我们当时都看到了什么。”

"SEELE's plan, the one we're getting manipulated into carrying out yet we can't do anything about."  
SEELE 的计划，那个我们被操纵着去执行却又无能为力的计划。

She frowned, "That stings just as much, I joined NERV to prove myself yet how can I do that knowing that everything I've done is just part of a higher plan to hand humanity over to some alien race?"  
她皱起眉头，“这同样让人心痛，我加入 NERV 是为了证明自己，但知道我所做的一切只是为了将人类交给某个外星种族的高级计划的一部分，我该如何证明自己？”

Her voice began to rise slightly, "How can I succeed against that Shinji? Everything that's happening, I'm useless against it, I'm powerless. I'm not even any use against the Angels anymore. I'm just fodder for them always having to be rescued by you, or Ayanami or even by the damn Angel killing itself."  
她的声音开始微微提高，“我该如何对抗这一切，真嗣？所有正在发生的事情，我对此无能为力，我毫无力量。我甚至不再对使徒有任何用处。我只是他们的炮灰，总是需要你、绫波或者甚至那个该死的使徒自己来救我。”

Shinji reached out to her and placed his hand on her shoulder, "That's not true, you helped me when…when Touji died. You helped rescue me from Leliel and countless other times you've helped me. We'll figure out what to do and I'll be there with you like I promised."  
真嗣向她伸出手，轻轻放在她的肩上，“那不是真的，你在我……在东治去世时帮助了我。你帮我从雷利尔手中逃脱，还有无数次你都帮助了我。我们会想出办法的，我会像我承诺的那样陪在你身边。”

"I guess you're right, it's just I hate being so defenseless. I hate just sitting there being unable to do anything. It's like we're all just dolls for someone's amusement."  
“我想你是对的，只是我讨厌如此无助。我讨厌只能坐在那里，什么也做不了。就好像我们都是某人娱乐的玩偶。”

She shuddered as she said the word 'dolls', the memory of her nightmare coming back to her slowly. Shinji noticed she was somewhat disturbed but didn't pursue it. Instead he simply reassured her again. "We'll figure out what to do. Keel…my father…whatever they're planning, we'll be there to stop it."  
她说出“玩偶”这个词时颤抖了一下，噩梦的记忆慢慢涌回心头。真嗣注意到她有些不安，但没有追问。相反，他再次安慰她，“我们会想出办法的。基尔……我的父亲……无论他们计划什么，我们都会在那里阻止他们。”

"Is that confidence I hear in your voice there, Ikari?"  
"伊卡里，你声音里是不是带着点自信？"

He smiled, "A bit." 他微笑道："有点。"

"There is something I don't understand though."  
"不过，有件事我还是不太明白。"

"What would that be?" “那会是什么呢？”

"Your father's involvement in this, he's NERV's director and working directly for Keel and SEELE."  
"你父亲参与其中，他是 NERV 的指挥官，直接为基尔和 SEELE 工作。"

"That's what it looks like."  
"看起来就是这样。"

"So why doesn't Keel trust him, why have we been fed information down from Kaji, Fuyutsuki and him? Information that I'm sure we're not meant to have. Keel only wanted us to be tools to fight the Angels, yet we know much more than we should have and I know you'll hate to hear this…but it's because of your father. Is he working against Keel?"  
"那么为什么基尔不信任他，为什么我们是从加持、冬月和他那里得到信息？那些我确信我们本不该知道的信息。基尔只想让我们成为对抗使徒的工具，但我们知道的远超应有的范围，我知道你不愿意听这个……但这是因为你的父亲。他是在对抗基尔吗？"

Shinji frowned as if he had been wondering the same thing himself earlier, but at the same time he didn't want to think about his father. He responded back, not bothering to try to hide the venom in his voice. "Don't be fooled by his act, he's probably working for his own agenda anyway. He's just as bad as Keel is. We can't trust him."  
真嗣皱起眉头，仿佛他自己之前也在思考同样的问题，但同时他又不愿去想他的父亲。他回应道，毫不掩饰声音中的怨恨。“别被他的表演骗了，他很可能只是在为自己的议程工作。他和基尔一样糟糕。我们不能信任他。”

"I'm not saying to trust him, I'm saying we should be careful. If he has his own agenda then we should be careful of that as well."  
“我不是说要信任他，我是说我们应该小心。如果他有他自己的议程，那么我们也应该对此小心。”

Shinji nodded and began to move from his position, trying to find something from the crash site. After a few minutes of looking and finding nothing he called back over to Asuka.  
真嗣点点头，开始从他的位置移动，试图从坠机现场找到些什么。经过几分钟的搜寻一无所获后，他向明日香喊道。

"Asuka…what are we trying to find here? Even if we do find something what will that prove?"  
"明日香…我们在这里到底要找什么？就算真的找到了，那又能证明什么呢？"

He got no response, so he turned around. To his surprise, Asuka was knelt down examining something in the ground. Could she have found something? No, that would be far too convenient, they were only there searching for remnants and even then it was just a whim. His gut told him that something would be here, but finding something that quick was far too convenient.  
他没有得到回应，于是转过身来。令他惊讶的是，明日香正跪在地上检查地面上的某样东西。她难道找到了什么吗？不，那未免也太巧了，他们只是在那里寻找遗留物，即便如此也只是一时兴起。他的直觉告诉他这里会有什么，但这么快就找到未免太过巧合。

"You found something?" "你找到什么了吗？"

She nodded and swept away some of the sand. What was there was not what either of them expected. It was a series of thick black cables buried in the sand. Asuka lifted one of them up as it rose out of the sand and seemed to stop near Shinji's feet. Shinji knelt down himself and began to dig where the cable had stopped. As he dug, he felt his hand rest against a solid rounded object.  
她点点头，拂去一些沙子。那里露出的东西出乎他们两人的意料。是一系列埋在沙中的粗黑电缆。明日香提起其中一根，它从沙中升起，似乎在真嗣脚边停了下来。真嗣跪下自己开始挖掘电缆停止的地方。随着挖掘，他感觉到手触碰到了一个坚硬的圆形物体。

He shook his head and thought aloud, "This is too convenient, the chances of this must be a million to one."  
他摇摇头，自言自语道：“这太巧合了，这种可能性一定是百万分之一。”

She responded slyly, "Yet still they come."  
她狡黠地回应：“然而它们依然出现了。”

Shinji grinned at her words, surprised that Asuka of all people would have said that. He cleared the area around the object and found what appeared to be a device buried there. On the top of it were a series of flashing blue lights and various symbols scattered around. Shinji recognized immediately the image he had encountered many times before, SEELE's logo.  
听到她的话，真嗣咧嘴一笑，没想到居然是明日香说出了这样的话。他清理了物体周围的区域，发现那里埋藏着一个看似装置的东西。它的顶部有一系列闪烁的蓝灯和散布在各处的各种符号。真嗣立刻认出了他多次遇到过的图像，SEELE 的标志。

"Asuka…I don't think we can get this out, do you have a camera with you?"  
“明日香……我觉得我们没法把它弄出来，你带相机了吗？”

She nodded, "Yeah its back in the car. What do you think this is?"  
她点点头，“嗯，在车里。你觉得这是什么？”

Shinji shrugged, completely unsure himself, "I have no idea. It could be a beacon. It would make sense seeing as that other ship was crashed here. Or it could be…well I don't want to say this but we could have just walked into a trap."  
真嗣耸了耸肩，自己也是一头雾水，“我完全不知道。可能是信号灯吧。考虑到那艘飞船坠毁在这里，这说得通。或者它可能是……呃，我不想这么说，但我们可能刚刚走进了一个陷阱。”

She frowned, "A trap?" 她皱起眉头，“陷阱？”

"It's possible SEELE wanted us to find this, but I can't think of a reason why. We'll get a few photos of it and try to work out what we can at NERV. Kaji and Misato should be able to help."  
“有可能，SEELE 希望我们找到这个，但我实在想不出他们为什么要这么做。我们先拍几张照片，回 NERV 后再试着分析一下。加持和美里应该能帮上忙。”

**Misato's Residence – 2015 hours  
美里住所 —— 2015 时**

Shinji paused outside Misato's door and drew his pistol. He cautiously drew himself up against the side of the doorway and knocked three times. He waited a bit more and called through the door, "Misato, its Shinji…"  
真嗣在美里的门前停下，拔出手枪。他小心翼翼地靠在门框边，敲了三下。稍等片刻后，他对着门喊道：“美里，是我，真嗣……”

He waited a few moments more until he heard the door clicking and then opening, he was greeted by both Misato and Kaji. He put his gun away and stepped inside the apartment. As he did so he noticed Misato shaking slightly. He embraced her as Kaji locked the door behind them. Misato let go of him as she led him into the main living area, he questioned her as they walked through.  
他又等了几分钟，直到听到门锁咔嗒一声，门随之打开，迎接他的是美里和加持。他收起枪，走进公寓。进门时，他注意到美里微微颤抖。他拥抱了她，而加持在他们身后锁上了门。美里放开他，带他走进客厅，他们边走他边询问她。

"What happened?" "发生了什么？"

She responded back her voice slightly shaky, "Someone was here Shinji. They were after me."  
她略带颤抖地回应道，“有人来过这里，真嗣。他们是冲着我来的。”

Shinji had never seen this from his former guardian before, she was frightened by whatever had happened. He looked around the apartment and into the kitchen, leading out to the fire escape. "Where?"  
真嗣从未见过他的前监护人如此惊慌，她显然被发生的事情吓到了。他环顾公寓，又走进厨房，通向防火梯的地方。“在哪里？”

"They were outside on the fire escape, I heard a noise from the kitchen and went inside. Then I saw them, a figure outside. I called Kaji and went outside, but they had fled."  
“他们在防火梯上，我听到厨房有动静就进去了。然后我看到了他们，外面有个人影。我给加持打了电话，出去查看，但他们已经逃走了。”

"Then what happened?" “然后发生了什么？”

"Then everything inside started going weird, the room began to shake and the doors began opening and closing randomly." A tear rolled down her cheek as she continued speaking, "They were after my baby Shinji, I know it."  
“然后里面的一切都变得奇怪起来，房间开始摇晃，门也随机地开开关关。”她一边说着，泪水顺着脸颊滑落，“他们是为了我的孩子真嗣，我知道的。”

Shinji's worst fears were confirmed at that moment. He knew Misato would never get this worked up unless she really meant it. He watched as Kaji came in and embraced Misato trying to calm her down, "Calm down Misato, no one's going to get your baby, it's safe."  
那一刻，真嗣最深的恐惧得到了证实。他知道美里绝不会如此激动，除非她是认真的。他看着加持进来，拥抱美里试图让她平静下来，“冷静点，美里，没人会伤害你的孩子，他很安全。”

Shinji looked out across the city. It was unusually dark for this time of year. He took it as a bad omen. Every time an Angel had attacked or something bad had happened to him it had been as pitch black as it was now. He turned to Kaji and spoke, "Kaji, did you see them?"  
"真嗣眺望着城市。这个季节的夜晚本不该如此漆黑。他将其视为不祥之兆。每当使徒来袭或他遭遇不幸时，夜色总是如现在这般漆黑。他转向加持，问道：“加持，你看到他们了吗？””

Kaji nodded, "I only saw them after Misato called me in, but I saw they had an A.T. Field."  
"加持点头，“在美里叫我进来之后我才看到他们，但我注意到他们拥有 A.T.力场。””

"An Angel?" "“使徒？””

"Or an Agent of SEELE. They looked to be heading towards NERV. It's only ten minutes from here."  
"或者是 SEELE 的特工。他们看起来正朝 NERV 总部去。从这儿过去只要十分钟。"

Shinji's expression quickly changed to one of horror, "NERV?"  
真嗣的表情迅速转变为惊恐，“NERV？”

"Yes, why?" “是的，怎么了？”

"I left Asuka at NERV, she's checking on something that we found today for me. I've got to get there immediately, are you two going to be alright?"  
"我把明日香留在 NERV 了，她在帮我检查今天发现的东西。我得立刻赶过去，你们俩能行吗？"

Kaji looked at him concerned, "I'll go with you, two people to take down this guy are better than one. Will you be alright here Misato?"  
加持担忧地看着他，"我跟你一起去，两个人对付这家伙总比一个人强。你在这里没问题吧，美里？"

She nodded although still shaken, "I'll be alright, I can still handle a gun. Just…be careful..."  
她虽然仍有些动摇，但还是点了点头，"我会没事的，我还能拿枪。只是……要小心……"

**NERV Offices – 2040 hours  
NERV 总部 – 20 时 40 分**

"Come on Asuka pick up…"  
“快接啊，明日香……”

He let the phone ring a few more times before hanging up and stuffing it back into his pocket. It didn't matter anymore, he had already arrived at NERV's headquarters. He looked up at the tall building. It looked even more foreboding than normal as if it had somehow taken on a life of its own.  
他让电话又响了几声，然后挂断，将其塞回口袋。现在这已经无关紧要了，因为他已经抵达了 NERV 的总部。他抬头望向那座高耸的建筑，它看起来比平时更加阴森，仿佛有了自己的生命。

He quickly made his way through the front door into the main lobby, as expected for this time of night the building was empty. As he made his way towards the main elevators his footsteps echoed all around the hall. He withdrew his gun and began to pick up pace towards the elevators. He felt his free hand begin to clench and unclench nervously, he pressed the button on the elevator and looked around. This was it, he would check on Asuka and she would be alright, he kept on thinking to himself. His stomach was telling him otherwise, that it wouldn't be fine, that whoever it was would have already gotten to her.  
他迅速穿过前门进入主大厅，正如深夜这个时间所料，大楼内空无一人。当他走向主电梯时，脚步声在大厅中回响。他掏出手枪，加快步伐朝电梯走去。他感到空着的那只手紧张地握紧又松开，按下电梯按钮并环顾四周。就是这样，他会去查看明日香，她会没事的，他不断这样告诉自己。但他的胃却在告诉他相反的情况，事情不会顺利，那个人可能已经找到她了。

'_No Asuka is fine, she's got the Evangelion Serum in her the same as me. She can defend herself. I'm just being stupid…'_  
'不，明日香没事，她和我们一样注射了福音战士血清。她能自卫。我只是太蠢了……'

He felt sick as the doors opened and he stepped inside, preparing to go down to the basement level. His thoughts were still racing, _'Nothing to say anything was wrong, it was all normal. Whoever it was, they wouldn't attack NERV would they? That'd be too risky even for an Angel, they were probably scared and ran off in that direction…'_  
电梯门打开时，他感到一阵恶心，走进去准备下到地下层。他的思绪仍在飞速运转，'没有任何迹象表明出了问题，一切都很正常。无论是谁，他们不会攻击 NERV 吧？那对天使来说也太冒险了，他们可能只是害怕，朝那个方向逃走了……'

The belief was short lived when he heard the sound of a gunshot ring out just as the elevator hit the destination. As the elevator doors opened he felt his knees tremble as he aimed directly forward. There was nothing or no one there, he peered down into the darkened corridor and cautiously took a step forward. As he moved someone caught his eye, it was a flashing red light on a device beside the elevator. He picked it up and found that it was an old SDAT device, much like one he used to own, hooked up to a small speaker. He pressed play on the device and the same gunshot sound he had just heard rang out through the corridor.  
当电梯到达目的地时，一声枪响短暂地打破了宁静。电梯门开启，他感到膝盖发软，直视前方。那里空无一人，他俯视着昏暗的走廊，小心翼翼地迈出一步。移动时，他的目光被电梯旁一个闪烁的红灯吸引。他拾起它，发现这是一个旧的 SDAT 设备，就像他曾经拥有的那种，连接在一个小扬声器上。他按下播放键，走廊里再次响起他刚刚听到的枪声。

He cursed under his breath as he set the SDAT player down, whoever was here had already gone and it looked like Asuka had gone as well. He stood up just as he felt his phone vibrating in his pocket. He looked at the caller display and noticed it was Asuka calling him.  
他低声咒骂，放下 SDAT 播放器，无论这里是谁，显然已经离开，而明日香似乎也已不见踪影。他刚站起身，就感觉到口袋里的手机在震动。他查看来电显示，发现是明日香打来的。

"Hello, Asuka?" “喂，明日香？”

He paused for a moment waiting for the reply, the voice that came back over however was not Asuka's voice.  
他停顿了一下，等待着回复，然而传回来的声音却不是明日香的声音。

"_Ikari, did you find the nice surprise I left for you down there?"_  
“碇，你找到我给你留下的惊喜了吗？”

Shinji shouted back into the phone, "Carter? What the hell are you doing with Asuka's phone, where is she?"  
真嗣对着电话大喊，“卡特？你拿着明日香的电话做什么，她人呢？”

"_Don't concern yourself over her, she's fine for now. It's time we had a discussion Ikari. Meet me in the dir...Sorry, your father's office..."_  
"别担心她，她现在没事。是时候我们谈谈了，碇。到主任……抱歉，你父亲的办公室来找我……"

**Directors Office – 2050 hours  
主任办公室 – 20:50**

Shinji burst through the door, his gun aimed pointed forwards, he could feel his heart pounding in his ears as he looked around the room. Just as with the basement level there didn't seem to be anyone there. He stepped over to his father's desk and began to examine what lay on top of it. This was unusual for him, the first time he had ever stepped foot inside here willingly and been able to examine in.  
真嗣猛地冲进门，枪口直指前方，他能感觉到自己的心跳在耳边轰鸣，环视房间。和地下室一样，这里似乎空无一人。他走到父亲的办公桌前，开始检查桌上的物品。这对他来说很不寻常，这是他第一次自愿踏入这里，并能够仔细查看。

Just as he suspected there was hardly anything inside or on the desk. His father was incredibly tidy and didn't seem to care much for bringing or keeping personal items nearby. He looked across and noticed another door leading out of the room into a big meeting room, from inside he could see two figures. One was lying on the floor the other standing over the other.  
正如他所料，桌子里或桌面上几乎空无一物。他的父亲极其整洁，似乎并不在意将个人物品带在身边或保持近处。他环顾四周，注意到另一扇门通向一个大型会议室，从里面可以看到两个人影。一个躺在地板上，另一个则站在旁边。

Shinji made his way into the room. Just as he had expected, Carter was the standing figure. However, he did not seem to be holding any sort of weapon. Asuka, however, was lying on the floor clutching her arm and her own gun was lying just meters away from her.  
真嗣走进房间。正如他所预料的，站着的是卡特。然而，他似乎并没有持有任何武器。而明日香则躺在地板上，紧抱着自己的手臂，她的枪就躺在离她几米远的地方。

"Agent Ikari, so glad you could join us."  
“碇特工，很高兴你能加入我们。”

Shinji didn't respond. Instead, he just aimed his gun at Carter. He felt his finger on the trigger.  
真嗣没有回应。相反，他只是将枪口对准了卡特。他感觉到自己的手指搭在扳机上。

"Oh come on Ikari, do you really think you'll be able to shoot me when your hands are shaking like that?"  
“哦，拜托，碇，你真的以为自己能在双手抖成那样的情况下开枪打我吗？”

Shinji replied back, barely able to speak the words, "What do you want, Carter?"  
真嗣勉强回话，几乎说不出话来，“你到底想要什么，卡特？”

"Haven't you figured that out yet Ikari? And to think the others fell to you so easily. What do you think Shinji? We want an end to this. We want to end it tonight and for that we want you. So if you want Sohryu to live then I would suggest you follow my instructions carefully. If you fail to follow them then I will kill Sohryu."  
"你还没弄明白吗，碇？没想到其他人这么轻易就败在你手下了。你怎么看，真嗣？我们想要结束这一切。我们想在今晚终结它，为此我们需要你。所以，如果你想让惣流活下去，我建议你仔细听从我的指示。如果你不照做，我就会杀了惣流。"

Shinji felt himself freeze up he looked at Asuka and then back to Carter. He would kill her if he didn't do what Carter said. His mind raced, he knew he should try to attack Carter, to try to end this now. He responded back weakly,  
真嗣感到自己僵住了，他看了看明日香，然后又转向卡特。如果他不按卡特说的做，她真的会杀了她。他的思绪飞速运转，他知道应该尝试攻击卡特，试图现在就结束这一切。他虚弱地回应道，

"I…what do you want me to do?"  
"我……你想让我做什么？"

Asuka tried to shout something out to Shinji, to try to get him to not do this. This only resulted in Carter kicking her swiftly in the spine.  
明日香试图向真嗣大喊些什么，试图阻止他这么做。结果只是卡特迅速踢中了她的脊椎。

"Mount Asama, meet me there. Come alone, if you fail to do so then I will hurl Sohryu into the volcano."  
“浅间山，来那里见我。独自前来，否则我会把惣流扔进火山。”

"I…I'll be there." “我……我会去的。”

"Good." “好。”

Shinji turned to head out the door when he heard a shuffling noise behind him. Slowly he turned, only to have Carter shoulder tackle him into the wall. Shinji felt his gun fly out of his hand as he slumped to the floor. He tried to raise his hands to defend himself or to push Carter out of the way.  
真嗣转身准备出门，却听到身后传来一阵窸窣声。他缓缓转过身，不料被卡特用肩膀撞向墙壁。真嗣感到手中的枪飞了出去，随即瘫倒在地。他试图举起双手自卫或推开卡特。

As he turned his head he noticed Carter had began to change some how. His body was looking more metallic than previously. Shinji dove for his gun and turned to aim it at Carter firing two bullets in his direction. Both were deflected by Carter's A.T. Field. Shinji threw the gun aside and moved towards him, only for he himself to get thrown back by the A.T. Field.  
当他转过头时，注意到卡特似乎开始发生了某种变化。他的身体看起来比之前更加金属化。真嗣扑向自己的枪，转身瞄准卡特，连开两枪。但都被卡特的 A.T.力场弹开。真嗣扔掉枪，朝他冲去，却被 A.T.力场弹了回来。

He felt himself hit the wall as Carter stood up, emitting a low growling noise.  
他感到自己撞到了墙上，而卡特站起身来，发出低沉的咆哮声。

"It's…happening earlier than it was supposed to…we will finish this at Asama Ikari."  
"它……比预定的时间早发生了……我们将在浅间山调布解决这一切。"

With those words, Carter picked up Asuka and took a running dive out of the window towards the street. Shinji was ready to dive after him when he felt himself get pulled back by someone else. He turned around ready to attack the person when he found himself looking at Kaji.  
说完这些话，卡特抱起明日香，从窗户向街道上跳了出去。真嗣正准备跟着跳出去时，突然感到有人拉住了他。他转身准备攻击那人，却发现站在面前的是加持。

Kaji pulled him round and glared at him "Shinji, what did you think you were doing?"  
加持将他拽过来，瞪着他问道：“真嗣，你以为你在做什么？”

Shinji took a deep breath, his eyes welling up as he watched Carter's A.T Field spread across the pavement. He turned to Kaji and shouted back at him, "He's got Asuka, I can't let him get away!"  
真嗣深吸一口气，眼中泛起泪光，看着卡特的 A.T 力场在路面上蔓延开来。他转向加持，朝他大喊：“他抓走了明日香，我不能让他逃走！”

"What so you were just going to jump out after him were you?"  
“所以你打算直接跳出去追他，是吗？”

"I can project an A.T. Field as well, I would have been…"  
“我也能投影 A.T.力场，我本可以……”

"Don't be an idiot Shinji, you don't even know how to project your A.T. Field let alone use it to stop you plummeting to your death."  
"别犯傻了，真嗣，你连如何投影你的 A.T.力场都不知道，更别提用它来阻止自己坠落至死了。"

Shinji spoke weakly slumping to the floor, "I…I just…I wanted to help her."  
真嗣虚弱地瘫坐在地上，说道：“我……我只是……想帮她。”

Kaji didn't feel any sympathy for him, instead he replied back still as sternly as he had before, "Well dying isn't a good way to start."  
加持对他没有丝毫同情，依旧严厉地回答：“不过，死可不是个好的开始。”

He paused for a moment, "The final few Angels have coordinated their attacks, this was planned from the start. Nagisa's kidnapping, sneaking one of them inside NERV, we've all been set up."  
他顿了顿，“最后几只使徒已经协调了他们的攻击，这一切从一开始就是计划好的。渚的绑架，其中一只潜入 NERV，我们都被设计了。”

Shinji wiped his eyes, "Why?"  
真嗣擦了擦眼睛，“为什么？”

"Keel is working with them for some reason. I don't know why but he is, just as he worked with Leliel. I just can't explain why Nagisa has vanished, unless he crossed SEELE."  
“基尔出于某种原因与他们合作。我不知道为什么，但他确实如此，就像他与雷里尔合作一样。我只是无法解释为什么渚会消失，除非他触犯了 SEELE。”

Shinji stood up and put his gun back into his jacket, "I'm going to get some answers from him, he told me to meet him at Mount Asama."  
真嗣站起身，将枪重新放回夹克里，“我要从他那儿得到一些答案，他让我在浅间山见他。”

Kaji warned him, "You shouldn't go Shinji, it's most likely a trap."  
加持警告他，“你不该去，真嗣，这很可能是个陷阱。”

"And if I don't go he's going to kill Asuka. I'm not letting her die because of my failure to do something. I'm not…" He paused nearly breaking down again, he had to go and do this. Asuka meant everything to him, getting answers meant everything to him and he wasn't going to let another person die because of his failure to do something. He finished speaking, his voice hoarse. "I don't want that to happen again."  
“如果我不去，他会杀了明日香。我不会因为自己的无所作为而让她丧命。我不能……”他顿了顿，几乎又要崩溃，但他必须去完成这件事。明日香对他意味着一切，得到答案对他意味着一切，他不会因为自己的无所作为而让另一个人死去。他声音沙哑地结束了讲话，“我不希望那种事再次发生。”

**Mount Asama – 2300 hours  
浅间山 —— 2300 时**

Shinji stepped out of the car and looked straight ahead. There was nowhere to hide this time and there was no use sneaking around. He looked off into the distance and spotted a set of devices on the ground around him. Each device was emitting a faint blue light and pointing up at the sky. As he made his way over towards them he spotted a set of thick cables connecting each one. He recognized them straight away as the same things he and Asuka had seen earlier that day. His suspicions were confirmed when he heard Carter's voice coming from the darkness.  
真嗣走下车，直视前方。这次无处可藏，也没有必要再偷偷摸摸。他向远处望去，发现周围地面上有一组设备。每个设备都发出微弱的蓝光，指向天空。当他走向这些设备时，他注意到每台设备之间都有粗电缆相连。他立刻认出这些正是他和明日香今天早些时候见过的东西。当听到卡特从黑暗中传来的声音时，他的怀疑得到了证实。

"Recognize them Ikari? They're homing beacons for our crafts. They are the very things we're going to be using when we colonize your planet."  
“认出来了吗，碇？这些是我们的飞行器的归航信标。正是我们用来殖民你们星球的东西。”

Shinji turned, aiming his gun towards Carter. Carter had now fully changed. He no longer looked human but now looked completely metallic. Shinji noticed another figure Carter was holding up, an unconscious Asuka. Shinji stepped forward calling her name.  
真嗣转身，将枪口对准了卡特。卡特此刻已完全变样，不再有半点人样，全身金属化。真嗣注意到卡特手中还提着一个身影，是昏迷不醒的明日香。真嗣向前一步，呼唤她的名字。

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

Carter brought one of his hands back and then straight forward, stabbing Asuka through the back. Shinji watched in horror as the blade attached to Carters arm went straight through her body sticking out of the front. Carter slowly withdrew it and threw Asuka to the floor in front of Shinji.  
卡特将一只手向后一拉，随即猛地向前刺去，刀刃穿透了明日香的后背。真嗣惊恐地看着卡特手臂上的刀刃直插入她的身体，从前胸穿出。卡特缓缓抽回刀刃，将明日香扔在了真嗣面前的地板上。

Shinji knelt down in front of her to see if she was alright, only to have Carter knock him off of his feet. He felt himself hit the ground as Carter stood over Asuka, again preparing to bring the blade down, his metallic face contorting into a sickening grin.  
真嗣跪在她面前，想查看她是否安好，却被卡特一击打翻在地。他感到自己重重摔在地上，而卡特站在明日香上方，再次准备挥刀下刺，金属面孔扭曲成一个令人作呕的狞笑。

"I'm under strict instructions not to kill you Ikari, your colleague however, I can do as I wish. I know I said I wouldn't kill her but where you're going it won't matter to you anymore."  
"我接到了严格指令，不能杀你，碇，但你的同事嘛，我就可以随心所欲了。我知道我说过不会杀她，但你去的地方，你也不会再在乎这些了。"

Shinji quickly got up and began to run towards Carter only to be pushed back by his A.T. Field. The force of the field was like nothing Shinji had felt before, he screamed out in pain as Carter laughed at him.  
真嗣迅速起身，向卡特跑去，却被他的 A.T.力场推了回来。这力场的力量是真嗣从未感受过的，他痛苦地尖叫，而卡特在一旁嘲笑他。

"Not like anything you've encountered is it Ikari? I was designed as the ultimate war machine by GEHIRN, by your father. He oversaw my creation, he and the rest of the scientists watched as I took apart villages and killed hundreds all in the name of research."  
"不像你以前遇到过的任何东西，对吧，碇？我是 GEHIRN，也就是你父亲设计的终极战争机器。他监督了我的创造，他和那些科学家们看着我摧毁村庄，屠杀数百人，一切都是为了研究。"

Shinji rushed forward again, once again clattering with the A.T. Field. This time however he was not thrown back instead he stood his ground. Around him he felt his own A.T. Field project forwards trying to cancel out the other field.  
真嗣再次冲上前去，又一次与 A.T.力场碰撞出声响。然而这一次，他没有被击退，而是稳住了脚步。他感觉到自己的 A.T.力场向前延伸，试图抵消对方的力场。

Both the fields stopped as Shinji dropped to his knees, weakened slightly. Carter made his way over to him and picked him up. Shinji quickly shook off Carter's hand and delivered a kick to his stomach. Carter recoiled slightly as the metallic body absorbed the blow.  
两个力场随着真嗣跪倒在地而停止了对抗，他略显虚弱。卡特走向他，将他扶起。真嗣迅速甩开卡特的手，一脚踢向他的腹部。卡特的身体微微后退，金属身躯吸收了这一击。

"I was hoping we could do this the easy way Ikari, I can't kill you but they don't care about the condition they get you in."  
“我本希望我们能和平解决这件事，碇。我不能杀你，但他们不在乎你被弄成什么样子。”

Shinji didn't hear the words anymore, all he saw in front of him was that alien, that monster that had tried to kill him and Asuka. He moved forward and swung at him, only to have it blocked and to be thrown to the ground again. Carter stood over him and picked him up, delivering a blow to the stomach. He followed it up with another blow and then delivered one directly to Shinji's head.  
真嗣再也听不见那些话语，他眼前只有那个外星生物，那个曾试图杀死他和明日香的怪物。他向前冲去，挥拳攻击，却被对方挡下并再次被摔倒在地。卡特站在他上方，将他提起，一拳打在肚子上。紧接着又是一拳，然后直接击中了真嗣的头部。

Shinji slumped to the floor, tasting his own blood as he struggled to get up on his feet. He felt Carters presence behind him and quickly elbowed the Angel. He followed up with a punch to the stomach only to have Carter's metallic body seemingly absorb the attacks. Carter laughed at him,  
真嗣瘫倒在地，尝到了自己的血，挣扎着想要站起来。他感觉到卡特就在身后，迅速用肘击向天使。随后又是一拳打在肚子上，但卡特的金属身躯似乎吸收了这些攻击。卡特嘲笑他，

"I told you Ikari, I was designed to be the ultimate war machine. Anything you hit me with will only make me stronger."  
“我告诉过你，碇，我是被设计成终极战争机器的。你打我的任何攻击只会让我变得更强。”

Carter brought up one of the blades again, Shinji noticed this time where they were from. They were actually a part of his arm. It had actually formed from the metallic substance he was made out of. Carter reached back and prepared to drive the blade into Shinji's arm. Shinji grabbed hold of Carters arm, screaming out as he felt the sharpened blades digging into his hand. He drove his arm around straight back into Carter's own body sending him reeling back a few steps.  
卡特再次举起其中一把刀刃，这次真嗣注意到了它们的来源。它们实际上是他手臂的一部分。这些刀刃是由他身体所构成的金属物质形成的。卡特向后一拉，准备将刀刃刺入真嗣的手臂。真嗣抓住卡特的手臂，尖叫着感受到锋利的刀刃刺入他的手掌。他用力将手臂猛地向后一挥，击中卡特的身体，使他踉跄后退了几步。

Shinji dove at him, bringing him to the ground. He aimed his gun at Carter's head and fired twice at point blank range. He felt LCL splattering all over his clothing as he reached back and fired again. He reached back again, his senses completely lost as he drove the butt of the gun into Carter's head. Each sickening blow splattered more LCL onto Shinji and onto the ground.  
真嗣扑向他，将他按倒在地。他举枪对准卡特的头部，近距离开了两枪。他感觉到 LCL 液体溅满了他的衣服，当他再次开枪时，他的感官完全迷失了，用枪托猛击卡特的头部。每一次令人作呕的打击都让更多的 LCL 溅到真嗣和地面上。

He reached back again and was about to drive the gun into him again when he heard a faint rumbling noise from around him. The ground began to shake as the blue lights from the devices increased in power. He looked up at a familiar sight, a huge craft floating over him, seemingly having come out of nowhere.  
他再次伸手准备再次用枪攻击时，听到了周围微弱的隆隆声。地面开始震动，装置发出的蓝光增强了。他抬头看到了一个熟悉的景象，一艘巨大的飞行器悬浮在他上方，似乎是从天而降。

All of a sudden a series of spotlights switched on from the bottom of the craft, flooding the area with an intense white light. Shinji scrambled over towards Asuka and knelt down near her, trying to pick her up. He felt weakened, though unable to do anything. He turned around and looked up at the craft, it seemed to be almost…inviting him.  
突然间，一连串的聚光灯从飞行器的底部亮起，将周围照得如同白昼。真嗣急忙爬向明日香，跪在她身边试图扶起她。他感到自己虚弱无力，却无计可施。他转过身，抬头望向那飞行器，它似乎在……邀请他。

He felt a strange sense of warmth spread through his body as he knelt looking up into the light. He turned as another figure appeared next to him and Asuka, he looked up at her and whispered her name.  
当他跪着仰望那光芒时，一种奇异的温暖感在他体内蔓延。他转身看到另一个身影出现在他和明日香旁边，他抬头看着她，轻声呼唤她的名字。

"Ayanami?" “绫波？”

He shook his head. No, it wasn't Ayanami, it was the same person he had seen in the forest that time. The same person who he had thought had looked like Ayanami but she was different. She didn't share the short blue hair, or the same expression. This person was smiling at him, almost like she was…  
他摇了摇头。不，那不是绫波，而是他在森林里见过的那个人。那个他曾以为长得像绫波但又有不同的人。她没有那头短蓝发，也没有同样的表情。这个人正对他微笑，仿佛在……

"Mother…?" "妈妈…？"

He turned back to Asuka and noticed she had opened her eyes and was looking at him, he felt tears rolling down his cheeks and he reached down and stroked her cheek.  
他转回身看向明日香，注意到她已经睁开了眼睛，正注视着他。他感到泪水滑过脸颊，便俯下身去轻抚她的脸颊。

"Shinji…what's happening?" She questioned him weakly.  
"真嗣…发生了什么？" 她虚弱地问道。

"I…It'll be alright Asuka, nothing's going to happen. I'm here with you."  
"我……没事的，明日香，什么都不会发生。我在这里陪着你。"

Asuka looked into his eyes and reached out her own hand to caress him, she felt his tears drop down onto her cheek and roll down mixing with her own. She closed her eyes again as she waited for him to help her up. Nothing happened though, she opened them again, and the light had gone, subsided. The roar of the alien craft had ceased and Shinji had gone, vanished, leaving her wounded and alone.  
明日香凝视着他的眼睛，伸出自己的手轻抚他，感觉到他的泪水滴落在她的脸颊上，与她的泪水混合在一起。她再次闭上眼睛，等待他扶她起来。然而什么也没有发生，她再次睁开眼，光芒已经消失，退去。外星飞船的轰鸣声也停止了，真嗣已经消失，不见踪影，留下她受伤且孤独一人。

### Chapter 24 Farewell

_4th September 2015 2015 年 9 月 4 日_

**Mt Asama – 1130 hours  
浅间山 – 11 点 30 分**

Asuka sat with her head resting on the steering wheel and her eyes fixed firmly ahead. Just as she had expected she was the only agent to have turned up. Although she had expected it, it angered her that no one else within NERV seemed to care that Shinji had gone, she didn't expect every Agent to suddenly leave what they were doing, but still the fact that a fellow Agent had gone missing is still a big deal. Maybe the thought of him being gone pleased them or they just didn't care.  
明日香将头靠在方向盘上，目光坚定地直视前方。正如她所料，她是唯一到场的特工。尽管她早有预料，但 NERV 内部似乎无人关心真嗣的失踪，这让她感到愤怒。她并不指望每位特工都会立刻放下手头的工作，但一名特工失踪毕竟是大事。或许他离开的消息让他们感到高兴，或者他们根本就不在乎。

Why was she the only one that seemed to care? She had never cared about anyone in the past, never wanted to rely on anyone, or get attached to anyone. She was her own person, she didn't need anyone. What was is about Shinji that made her feel different, was it that they were both caught in the same net? That they were both being manipulated the same way? If that was the case then why had she had feelings for him before she had learned of SEELE's plans.  
为什么只有她似乎在乎？她过去从未关心过任何人，从未想过依赖或依恋任何人。她是独立的个体，不需要任何人。真嗣身上有什么让她感觉不同？是因为他们都陷入了同样的困境？都被同样地操纵着？如果是这样，那为什么在得知 SEELE 的计划之前，她就已经对他产生了感情。

Or was it something else, was it because she knew how similar they were, she just couldn't bring herself to admit it? Until now, until she knew it was too late. In many ways what had happened proved to her why she shouldn't get attached, because she would only get abandoned and hurt.  
还是说，这是因为她深知他们有多么相似，只是无法让自己承认这一点？直到现在，直到她明白为时已晚。在很多方面，发生的事情向她证明了为何她不该投入感情，因为她只会被抛弃和伤害。

She sighed and sat back in her seat, _'Shinji you idiot…Why did they have to take you?'_  
她叹了口气，靠回椅背上，‘真嗣你这个笨蛋……他们为什么要带走你？’

This was becoming a ritual for her. Every day since she had checked out of the hospital she had came here. Hoping to find some trace, some hint to where he was or just hoping that she'd turn up here and he'd be standing there waiting for her. Today though she was here officially, she had swallowed her pride and asked for assistance on the case. She had sent a message round saying she would be here and that she would be leading the search.  
这已成为她的日常仪式。自从她出院以来，每天她都会来到这里。希望能找到一些线索，一些关于他下落的提示，或者仅仅是希望她会出现在这里，而他正站在那里等着她。但今天她是正式来此，她咽下了自尊，请求案件上的协助。她发出了消息，表示她将在这里，并领导这次搜寻。

She coughed and instantly clutched her ribs in pain. She felt under her shirt at the bandages that had been put into place, another thing to make her feel worse, to make her feel useless. She had been unable to do anything against Carter. She had been easily manipulated and easily dealt with. Then Shinji had to come to her aid again while she lay there, unable to do anything while he fought for her and she hated him for it. That was her strongest emotion from it, not sadness but hatred because Shinji fought because of her and then simply abandoned her and left her to die. She hated herself for thinking this way because she knew it wasn't his fault. She knew he couldn't be blamed for it and that it was out of his hands, but she couldn't help it.  
她咳嗽一声，立刻因疼痛而紧抓肋骨。她隔着衬衫摸了摸已经包扎好的绷带，这又让她感觉更糟，觉得自己一无是处。面对卡特，她毫无还手之力。她轻易被操控，轻易被对付。然后真嗣不得不再次来救她，而她躺在那里，无能为力，看着他为她而战，她为此恨他。她最强烈的情绪不是悲伤，而是恨意，因为真嗣因她而战，然后又简单地抛弃她，任她自生自灭。她恨自己这样想，因为她知道这不是他的错。她知道他不该为此受责备，这一切都超出了他的控制，但她无法控制自己。

She hated Carter for getting into NERV so easily, for manipulating her and then nearly killing her. Yet again she hated herself just as much for letting it happen to her. She had known there was something about him but why couldn't she have seen it coming? Why did she let him manipulate her? Why did she follow him when he said he needed help finding something on the tapes? Why was she so slow to react when he pulled her own gun on her?  
她恨卡特如此轻易地进入 NERV，操纵她，差点杀了她。同样，她恨自己让这一切发生。她早就察觉他有问题，但为什么没能预见到？为什么她会让他操纵自己？为什么当他声称需要帮助从录像带上找东西时，她会跟随他？为什么当他用她的枪对准她时，她反应如此迟钝？

'_I hate waiting…I hate people…I hate NERV…'_  
'我讨厌等待……我讨厌人……我讨厌 NERV……'

She was snapped out of her thoughts by the sound of someone tapping on her car window. She looked out and saw Kaji standing by the car. She hadn't even heard or seen him pull up. She was so wrapped up in her own thoughts a Mexican mariachi band could have walked past her car and she probably wouldn't have noticed.  
她被某人敲打车窗的声音从思绪中拉回现实。她向外看去，看到加持站在车旁。她甚至没听到或看到他停车。她完全沉浸在自己的思绪中，哪怕一个墨西哥 mariachi 乐队从她车旁走过，她可能都不会注意到。

She rolled down her window and smiled at the sight of him, "Kaji, I'm surprised to see you here. I didn't think…I didn't think anyone else knew about this investigation."  
她摇下车窗，看到他时露出了笑容，"加持，在这里见到你真意外。我没想到……我没想到还有其他人知道这个调查。"

She groaned inwardly at her attempt to try to save face in front of him. He would have been the first to know she had asked for assistance, there was no use covering it up. Why did she even bother? To save what little pride she had after much of it had been torn away by Carter, she started to think to herself just what the point in pride was anymore?  
她内心呻吟着，试图在他面前挽回面子。他本就是第一个知道她求助的人，掩饰毫无意义。她为何还要费心？在被卡特撕碎了大部分自尊后，她开始自问，自尊还有什么意义？

"They don't Asuka, that's why I'm here."  
“他们不会的，明日香，所以我才在这里。”

She looked at him surprised, "What do you mean they don't?"  
她惊讶地看着他，“你说的‘他们不会’是什么意思？”

He walked around to the other side of the car and got into the passenger side. He rubbed his head and prepared himself for the inevitable backlash from the red headed Agent. "Look Asuka, that message you sent out. It was deleted, removed. That's why no one has turned up today. That's why no one knows about Shinji's abduction and why I'm here."  
他绕到车的另一边，坐进了副驾驶座。他揉了揉头，准备好迎接红发特工不可避免的反击。“听着，明日香，你发出的那条信息。它被删除了，移除了。这就是为什么今天没人出现。这就是为什么没人知道真嗣被绑架的事，以及我为什么会在这里。”

He prepared himself for whatever she might do, having been her guardian for some time in the past he had seen her angry and what she did to people that angered her. He was sure that whatever she was about to do wouldn't be pleasant.  
他准备好应对她可能做出的任何举动，毕竟在过去的一段时间里，他曾是她的监护人，见过她生气的样子以及她对惹怒她的人所做的事情。他确信她即将做的事情不会令人愉快。

A few moments passed as she sat contemplating what he had just said, she then turned to him and much to her surprise she didn't hit him or yell at him. Instead she smiled and nodded, "I see…on whose orders?"  
她坐了一会儿，思考着他刚刚说的话，然后转向他，令她惊讶的是，她既没有打他也没有对他大喊大叫。相反，她微笑着点了点头，“我明白了……是谁的命令？”

Kaji breathed a sigh of relief and began to explain, "The director, Shinji's father did. He didn't want anyone beyond your department to get involved in it. He said that if SEELE were able to get an Agent in like that so easily and were able to abduct Shinji like that then they might try it again. He wants to keep it quiet for now. He is, however, giving you free reign to get him back."  
加治松了一口气，开始解释道：“是导演，真嗣的父亲做的决定。他不希望除了你们部门以外的人卷入此事。他说如果 SEELE 能这么轻易地安插特工并绑架真嗣，他们可能会再次尝试。他目前希望保持低调。不过，他给了你自由行动的权利，让你去把他找回来。”

"Who will I have helping me?"  
“谁会来协助我？”

"You will have mine and Misato's full cooperation with this, she wants Shinji back just as bad as you do. You will also have the aid of Deputy Director Fuyutsuki."  
“你将得到我和美里全力支持，她和你一样迫切希望真嗣回来。你还会得到副导演冬月的帮助。”

"Why is the Director suddenly taking such a big interest in his son?"  
“为什么司令突然对儿子如此关注？”

"Because without Shinji his scenario is doomed…and SEELE will win."  
“因为没有真嗣，他的计划注定失败……而 SEELE 将获胜。”

_7__th_ _September 2015_ 2015 年 9 月 7 日

**Director's Office – 1030 hours  
局长办公室 —— 10 点 30 分**

Fuyutsuki glanced out of the window, his expression grim. It had been two weeks since Zeruel, and if he was paranoid about SEELE and everything going wrong before, Shinji vanishing had only amplified that feeling. He looked across at the director, even he had changed since it had happened. Fuyutsuki wasn't quite sure if it was because Shinji had been abducted or if it was because SEELE and Keel had outwitted him, but he was directing his own efforts into regaining Shinji and, more importantly, the key to beating SEELE.  
冬月瞥向窗外，神情严峻。自从零号使徒事件已经过去两周，如果他之前对 SEELE 和一切可能出错的事情感到偏执，那么真嗣的失踪只是加剧了这种感觉。他看向局长，就连他也自那件事后发生了变化。冬月不太确定这是因为真嗣被绑架，还是因为 SEELE 和基尔欺骗了他，但他现在正全力找回真嗣，更重要的是，夺回击败 SEELE 的关键。

"It's been nearly two weeks Ikari and still no trace, they've covered their tracks well this time."  
“已经快两周了，碇，依然毫无线索，他们这次掩盖痕迹做得很好。”

"It's only a matter of time until something is found Fuyutsuki. All we can do now is wait until we get the reports from Sohryu's team."  
"不久就会有所发现，冬月。我们现在只能等待，直到惣流团队传来报告。"

"Are you sure it was wise having her lead the team? It wasn't long ago that she was expendable and now she is leading the team to get Shinji back. I thought you would have had Rei conduct the search."  
"让她领导团队真的明智吗？不久前她还被视为可牺牲的，现在却要带领团队去救回真嗣。我以为你会让绫波来执行搜索任务。"

Gendo smiled and nodded, "Things change Fuyutsuki. We have to constantly adapt our scenario because of Keel. We have had to take into account variations that we did not plan for. As much as I hate admitting it I was wrong, we were wrong about Sohryu. She has become just as important to the scenario as Shinji or Rei."  
碇源堂微笑着点头，"情况在变，冬月。由于基尔的缘故，我们不得不不断调整计划。我们必须考虑到未曾预料到的变数。尽管我不愿承认，但我错了，我们对惣流的看法错了。她现在对计划的至关重要性，不亚于真嗣或绫波。"

Fuyutsuki nodded, knowing that it must have been serious if Gendo was admitting he was wrong. Although he supposed that the reason she was now so important was because of the relationship her and Ikari's son seemed to have developed. It was something they hadn't thought about when they had assigned Sohryu to the Evangelion project, yet at the same time it was something that potentially made it easier for them to achieve their goal.  
冬月点了点头，知道如果源堂承认自己错了，那一定是严重的事情。尽管他认为她现在如此重要，是因为她和碇的儿子似乎发展出的关系。这是他们在指派惣流参与 EVA 项目时未曾考虑到的，然而与此同时，这也可能使他们更容易实现目标。

"The relationship Sohryu and your son have…it's nice to see that develop."  
“惣流和你儿子的关系……看到他们这样发展真好。”

"I agree, yet we must not lose sight of our true goal. Shinji…he hates me now, but if he knew what we were trying to do then he would understand."  
“我同意，但我们绝不能忘记我们的真正目标。真嗣……他现在恨我，但如果他知道我们在努力做什么，他会理解的。”

Fuyutsuki chuckled slightly, "Is that an admission of guilt?"  
冬月轻笑一声，“这是在承认罪行吗？”

Ikari spoke back, his voice still stern, "I do not admit guilt. Although I am not proud of all my actions, I do not feel guilt for any of them. After Yui died I had to do something. Sending Shinji away was my only choice. If I had not then the committee would have started the Evangelion Project much sooner and we would not be in the position we are in now."  
碇源堂回话，语气依旧严厉，“我不承认有罪。虽然我并非为所有行为感到自豪，但我对任何行为都不感到愧疚。在唯去世后，我必须采取行动。将真嗣送走是我唯一的选择。若非如此，委员会会提前启动 EVA 计划，我们也不会陷入现在的境地。”

"Of course, what is the committees' stance on Shinji's disappearance?"  
“当然，委员会对真嗣的失踪持何立场？”

"As far as they're concerned it is not their problem. They are claiming ignorance in the knowledge that Agent Carter was an Angel and as far as Shinji's abduction goes they do not control the Aliens actions, they are merely a liaison."  
"在他们看来，这并非他们的责任。他们声称对此一无所知，知道卡特 agent 曾是天使，至于真嗣的绑架，他们并不控制外星人的行为，只是作为联络者。"

"Sounds like them…" "听起来像他们的作风……"

Gendo continued speaking, "That's why I'm accepting Rei's request to be reassigned to NERV. It shall be much easier for her to continue her previous assignment there as well. It will, however, create another problem with Sohryu."  
碇继续说道，“这就是我接受丽请求调到 NERV 的原因。她在那里继续之前的任务会容易得多。然而，这会与惣流产生另一个问题。”

"You mean what happened at Asama?" Fuyutsuki asked him.  
"你是说在浅间发生的事？" 冬月问他。

"Indeed, I do not think Sohryu will be too pleased with what happened. She has a temper similar to her mother's"  
"确实，我想碇不会对发生的事情太高兴。她的脾气和她母亲一样火爆。"

"Do you think Rei will be able to handle her?"  
"你觉得丽能应付得了她吗？"

"I believe she will be able to make Sohryu understand. Rei has been acting differently since we took her away from NERV, even more so since it was confirmed that Keel contacted her."  
“我相信她能让草薙理解。自从我们从 NERV 带走丽以来，她的行为就有所不同，尤其是在确认基尔联系了她之后。”

Gendo paused for a moment before continuing, "Keel is trying to manipulate her the same way he was able to manipulate Shinji. Using the knowledge of her origins and how she was brought up as leverage against me."  
碇暂停了一下，然后继续说道：“基尔正试图以同样的方式操纵她，就像他操纵真嗣一样。利用她身世和成长经历的知识作为对付我的筹码。”

Fuyutsuki nodded, not really too concerned. He knew Keel was very manipulative but he also knew how strong Rei could be. "Surely Rei will be able to handle that though, it may be unsettling for her but I do not think Keel will be able to manipulate her."  
冬月点了点头，并不太担心。他知道基尔非常善于操纵，但他也知道丽有多坚强。“丽肯定能应付得来，尽管这可能让她不安，但我认为基尔无法操纵她。”

"I do not want to take any risks though, that is why I am giving her what she wants for now. She knows how important she is to me and the future and I do not think she would allow Keel to sway her easily. Yet at the same time there is so much at stake here, Keel wasn't just after Shinji on that night. He sent Carter to kidnap two people, if we didn't station Rei where we did he would have succeeded. We need to ensure Rei is definitely on our side."  
“尽管如此，我不想冒任何风险，这就是为什么我现在给她她想要的东西。她知道她对我以及未来有多么重要，我不认为她会轻易被基尔说服。然而与此同时，这里牵涉的利害关系太大了，基尔那晚不仅仅针对真嗣。他派卡特去绑架两个人，如果我们没有把绫波安排在那里，他早就得逞了。我们需要确保绫波绝对站在我们这一边。”

_14__th_ _September 2015_ 2015 年 9 月 14 日

**NERV Offices – 1315 hours  
NERV 办公室 – 13 时 15 分**

Asuka sat looking directly at Shinji's desk. It was close to three weeks now since he had disappeared, yet she could still sense his presence there. She could almost see him sitting, staring down at whatever they were working on. His expression whenever she would shoot down something he said or his eyes lighting up whenever she agreed with him.  
明日香坐在那里，直视着真嗣的桌子。距离他消失已经快三周了，但她仍能感觉到他的存在。她几乎能看到他坐在那里，盯着他们在忙的东西。每当她否决他的提议时他的表情，或是她赞同他时他眼中闪烁的光芒。

There was still only her, Kaji and Misato working on locating him. According to Kaji the Director, Shinji's father, was also working on it but she didn't see any proof of this. She laughed at the idea that the director was actually doing anything. As far as she was concerned he couldn't care less and was only saying that to try to save face and ensure Asuka didn't go talking with the other Agents.  
寻找他的工作依然只有她、加持和美里在努力。据加持说，总监，也就是真嗣的父亲，也在参与其中，但她并未看到任何证据。她对总监实际在做任何事的念头嗤之以鼻。在她看来，他根本不在乎，这么说只是为了保全面子，确保明日香不会和其他特工谈论此事。

That wasn't all she had to worry about though, NERV was still under heavy pressure to locate Kaworou Nagisa. With only her working on two cases, neither one was making any progress. Misato and Kaji had tried to help her, they even had a session going through all the possibilities but it was useless.  
但这并不是她唯一要担心的事，NERV 仍在承受巨大压力，要求找到渚薰。她一个人同时处理两起案件，却毫无进展。美里和加持试图帮助她，他们甚至进行了一次全面梳理所有可能性的会议，但毫无用处。

All they had to go on was the crash site and the Mt. Asama site and they had been to Asama so many times since the incident. For once Asuka actually wished that someone would drop a hint like they had before, that's how this had always started. An anonymous tip off, or a random guess based on what they had found, but nothing had been found.  
他们所依赖的只有坠机现场和浅间山现场，自那次事件以来，他们已经无数次前往浅间山。这一次，明日香真心希望有人能像以前那样给个提示，因为这一切总是这样开始的。一个匿名的线索，或是基于他们所发现的东西做出的随机猜测，但什么也没有找到。

Her thoughts were interrupted by a knocking at the door. She called across for the person to enter. The door opened and the person stepped inside, making their way towards Asuka's desk. Asuka, however, had her head down and did not take any notice until the person spoke.  
她的思绪被敲门声打断。她大声喊着让来人进来。门开了，那人走了进来，朝明日香的桌子走去。然而，明日香低着头，直到那人开口说话，她才注意到。

"Excuse me, Agent Sohryu?"  
“打扰一下，索鲁尤特工？”

Asuka turned her head slightly and looked wide eyed up at the person who had just entered. She blinked to make sure it wasn't an illusion and then blinked again, just to double check.  
明日香微微侧过头，睁大眼睛看着刚刚进来的人。她眨了眨眼，确认这不是幻觉，然后又眨了一次，只是为了再次确认。

'_What the hell is she doing here?'_  
“她到底在这里干什么？”

Asuka replied back casually, "Ayanami, what can I do for you?"  
明日香随意地回应道，“绫波，有什么我能帮忙的吗？”

"I have been assigned by Director Ikari to work with you on locating his son. I have also been reassigned back to this section in the case of another Angel attack."  
"我被碇司令指派来协助你寻找他的儿子。同时，我也被调回这个部门，以防另一次使徒袭击。"

Asuka smiled slightly, not really sure what to make of the situation. Although she wasn't going to admit it, she could have done with the extra help. The only problem with this 'extra help' was it was coming in the form of someone Asuka wasn't even sure she could trust. In fact, it was coming in the form of someone Asuka wasn't even sure she liked. It was unusual, but now she found herself in the same position Shinji probably was when she had first stepped through that door. She wasn't sure if Rei had another motive or if she was here on her own.  
惣流微微一笑，对这情况并不完全确定该如何应对。虽然她不会承认，但她确实需要额外的帮助。这个所谓的'额外帮助'的问题在于，它来自一个惣流甚至不确定自己能否信任的人。事实上，她甚至不确定自己是否喜欢这个人。这很反常，但现在她发现自己处于真嗣当初第一次走进那扇门时的境地。她不确定绫波是否有其他动机，或者她是否是出于自己的意愿来到这里。

"So you're the help that Director Ikari said he was going to send. Better late than never I suppose."  
"所以你就是碇司令说的要派来的帮手。我想，迟到总比不到好。"

Rei looked at her and began to speak, "I am not the help Director Ikari mentioned. I requested to be assigned to work with you. I wanted to help you."  
丽看着她，开始说道：“我不是碇指挥官提到的那位助手。我主动请求被分配来与你合作。我想帮助你。”

The announcement took Asuka by surprise. Up until now she had thought that Rei was incapable of making her own decisions. Although she still wasn't sure it was not just some ploy to gain her trust, she was slightly relieved that she would be gaining Ayanami's assistance willingly. At least she knew Ayanami as opposed to another Agent sent by SEELE.  
这个消息让明日香感到意外。直到现在，她一直认为丽无法自己做决定。尽管她仍然不确定这是否只是某种获取她信任的策略，但她稍微松了一口气，因为至少绫波是自愿来协助她的。至少她对绫波有所了解，而不是另一个由 SEELE 派来的特工。

"You wanted to help me?"  
“你想帮助我？”

Rei nodded, "Yes." 丽点了点头，“是的。”

"Why?" "为什么？"

Rei thought about the question and wasn't really sure of how to answer it. She didn't really have a good reason, just that she wanted to. "I…do…"  
丽思考着这个问题，不太确定如何回答。她并没有什么好的理由，只是想这么做。“我……愿意……”

Asuka shook her head. "Never mind, I guess you can tag along with me for a while then. I'm just about to head out now anyway, so if you want to come you can." She paused then continued, "In fact you are coming with me, there are some questions I want answered when we get there."  
明日香摇了摇头。“算了，我想你可以暂时跟我一起。我正准备出门，如果你想来的话可以。”她顿了顿，接着说，“事实上，你得跟我一起去，到了那里我有几个问题要问清楚。”

**Ship Crash site – 1345 hours  
船只坠毁现场 —— 1345 时**

Asuka pulled the car up and looked at the site in mild shock. No longer was it an empty waste desert area, but now a chain link fence had been set up around the area and huge rounded tents had been set up over where they had found the craft and the devices they had found.  
明日香停下车，带着轻微的震惊环顾四周。这里不再是那片荒凉的沙漠，而是竖起了铁丝网围栏，巨大的圆形帐篷覆盖在他们发现飞船和装置的地方。

Asuka swore under her breath and switched the car engine off. She turned to Rei and asked her angrily, "Who are they?"  
明日香低声咒骂，熄灭了汽车引擎。她转向绫波，愤怒地问道：“他们是谁？”

Rei looked out at the tents, "SEELE's people. Keel probably wanted to make sure you didn't find anything else."  
丽看着那些帐篷，“SEELE 的人。基尔可能想确保你没找到其他东西。”

"So you know we found something then?"  
“这么说，你知道我们找到了什么？”

"Director Ikari told me you had located the crash site and some of the beacons. He said that SEELE would probably know this as well and that they would want to stop you from returning."  
“碇指挥官告诉我你们已经找到了坠机地点和一些信标。他说 SEELE 很可能也知道这些，并且他们会想阻止你们返回。”

Asuka eyed her suspiciously. It was strange, but Rei was unusually talkative. Although it was about what she was being asked, it was still a bit unusual to hear Rei actually answer her instead of trying to cover up.  
明日香怀疑地打量着她。这很奇怪，但丽今天异常健谈。尽管话题是她被问及的内容，但听到丽真的回答她而不是试图掩饰，还是有点不寻常。

"So what were these 'beacons'?"  
“那么，这些‘信标’是什么？”

"They are landing beacons for the crafts they use. There are sites scattered throughout the country and in other parts of the world."  
“它们是他们使用的飞行器的着陆信标。全国各地乃至世界其他地方都散布着这些站点。”

"So this is what they'll be using when all the Angels are gone?"  
"所以这就是他们将在所有使徒消失后使用的东西？"

"Yes." "是的。"

Asuka looked back out at the tents. A part of her wanted to get inside the complex to see what was happening inside but she knew it was too risky. Her first priority was to get Shinji back and she wouldn't be much use for that if she was dead. There didn't seem to be any entrance into the complex either, the fence was electrified and there seemed to be small outposts set up at certain points.  
明日香回头望向那些帐篷。她的一部分想要进入那个设施内部看看发生了什么，但她知道这太冒险了。她的首要任务是找回真嗣，如果她死了，就无法做到这一点。似乎也没有任何进入设施的入口，围栏是通电的，而且在某些点上设有小型哨所。

Asuka started the car engine up and began to reverse away from the site, as she moved away she questioned Rei again.  
明日香启动了汽车引擎，开始倒车离开现场，随着她逐渐远离，她再次向绫波提问。

"So why did Ikari assign you somewhere else, what were you doing during the time we had SEELE's Angel assigned to work with us?"  
"那么为什么碇司令把你调到别处去了，在我们与 SEELE 的天使合作期间，你都在做什么？"

"I was told it was for my own protection that I could not work with you two for that time period. I was…elsewhere during that time."  
"我被告知那段时间不能与你们两位合作是为了我的安全考虑。那段时间我……在别的地方。"

Asuka pushed the subject, trying to find out more, "Elsewhere? Not really much of an answer, what were you doing?"  
明日香继续追问，试图了解更多，"别的地方？这回答太含糊了，你到底在做什么？"

Rei replied again trying to avoid the subject. "I was assigned to another mission."  
丽再次回答，试图避开这个话题。“我被指派了另一个任务。”

Asuka snapped back, her voice slightly raised, "What mission? Look Ayanami I'm not going to lie to you. I don't like you. After what you did to us at the start of this whole mess who can blame me, but I want to know what you were doing. If you want to help me find Shinji you're going to have to tell me."  
明日香厉声回击，声音略微提高，“什么任务？听着，绫波，我不想对你撒谎。我不喜欢你。在这场混乱开始时你对我们所做的一切，谁又能怪我呢，但我想要知道你在做什么。如果你想帮我找到真嗣，你就得告诉我。”

"I was…Ikari assigned me to watch over Katsuragi to ensure Carter did not do anything. The night of Shinji's disappearance I was the one who chased him away from her apartment and towards NERV."  
“我被……碇指派去监视葛城，确保卡特不会做出什么。真嗣失踪的那晚，是我把他从她的公寓赶走，并引向 NERV。”

Asuka stopped the car there and looked at her. Carter had been to Katsuragi's on that night and had been chased towards NERV. Rei had already known Carter was an Agent of SEELE, yet Rei had been silent.  
明日香在那儿停下车，看着她。卡特那晚去过葛城家，并被追赶至 NERV。丽早已知道卡特是 SEELE 的特工，然而丽却保持沉默。

"You…you knew he was working against us?"  
“你……你知道他在与我们作对吗？”

"Yes…" "是的…"

"You knew all along yet you didn't say anything. You could have stopped him yet you just let him…"  
“你一直都知道却什么都没说。你本可以阻止他，但你却任由他……”

"I was following orders."  
“我只是在服从命令。”

Asuka cut her off and began shouting at her, "To hell with your fucking orders, that bastard took Shinji, he stabbed me, Ayanami. Have you even seen what he did?  
“去他妈的狗屁命令！”明日香打断她，开始对她大喊，“那个混蛋带走了真嗣，他刺伤了我，绫波。你见过他做了什么吗？”

Asuka lifted up her shirt, exposing the bandages wrapped around her to Ayanami. Rei tried not to look as Asuka continued shouting at her. "Look Ayanami, I nearly bled to death on that mountain while you did nothing. You just stayed there following your orders like the doll that you are. Is this why you're here now? Is this just another order for you to follow?"  
明日香掀起上衣，露出缠绕在身上的绷带给绫波看。绫波尽量不去看，但明日香继续对她大喊：“看啊，绫波，我在那座山上差点流血致死，而你什么都没做。你就那样像个玩偶一样，只是呆在那里服从命令。你现在来这里，就是为了再执行一个命令吗？”

Rei didn't lift her head up. Instead she just spoke quietly, "I'm sorry I…"  
丽没有抬起头。她只是轻声说道，“对不起，我……”

"You're sorry? Well isn't that convenient, the doll can apologize. So what did Director Ikari tell you, to just sit back while two of his Agents were nearly killed?"  
“你道歉？真是方便啊，人偶也会道歉了。那么，碇司令是怎么跟你说的，让你就这么坐着，眼睁睁看着他的两名特工差点丧命？”

Rei felt a deep sadness inside of her as Asuka finished speaking. She could feel the backs of her eyes burning as for the first time tears threatened to roll down her cheeks. She tried to regain her composure to respond. "No he didn't. He told me to stay and watch Katsuragi's apartment until you and Ikari had dealt with the angel."  
听着明日香说完，丽感到内心深处涌起一股悲伤。她能感觉到眼眶后部灼热，泪水第一次威胁着要滑落脸颊。她试图恢复镇定来回应。“他没有。他让我留下来监视葛城小姐的公寓，直到你和真嗣处理完天使。”

Asuka shouted back, not even caring what Ayanami had just said. As far as she was concerned it was all a lie and Ayanami was just trying to make up a way to get herself out of it. "Watch Katsuragi's apartment? What sort of excuse is that, she can handle herself why would she need you to watch over her?"  
明日香大声回击，根本不在乎绫波刚才说了什么。在她看来，这一切都是谎言，绫波只是在找借口脱身。“监视葛城小姐的公寓？这算什么借口，她自己能应付，为什么要你看着她？”

"Because her baby is in danger, Carter was after both her and Ikari."  
“因为她的孩子有危险，卡特的目标是她和孩子。”

"Her baby is in danger? What possible use could SEELE have for a baby?"  
“她的孩子有危险？SEELE 要一个婴儿有什么用？”

"I haven't been told…" "我还没被告知……"

"How convenient, Wondergirl manages to avoid the question again."  
"真是方便，奇迹少女又一次避开了问题。"

"Sohryu I'm…sorry." "苍龙，我……对不起。"

Rei felt the tears rolling down her cheeks as she apologized, she turned away from Asuka and wiped her eyes with her sleeve. Asuka glanced directly ahead, not caring about the state of her 'colleague'. Instead she just started the car back up and drove towards Tokyo 3 again.  
丽感觉到泪水顺着她的脸颊滑落，她一边道歉，一边转身避开明日香，用袖子擦了擦眼睛。明日香直视前方，对她的'同事'的状态漠不关心。她只是重新启动了汽车，再次向第三新东京市驶去。

Much to her surprise, Rei began speaking again although Asuka wasn't really taking much notice of her.  
令她惊讶的是，丽又开始说话了，尽管明日香并没有太在意她。

"I made a mistake by requesting to be reassigned…"  
“我请求调职是个错误……”

Asuka snapped back, "That's an understatement. What, did you think I'd just forgive you when you told me you stood by and did nothing? Just because you're ordered to do something doesn't mean it's the best course of action."  
明日香厉声反驳道：“这简直是轻描淡写。怎么，你以为告诉我你袖手旁观后，我就会轻易原谅你吗？仅仅因为被命令去做某事，并不意味着那就是最佳选择。”

"I know, that's why I went to Asama…"  
“我知道，所以我去找了浅间……”

Asuka pushed further. She couldn't believe the nerve of Ayanami. Was that supposed to make her feel any better? That she turned up later, why couldn't she have been there from the start?  
明日香步步紧逼。她简直不敢相信绫波的胆量。这难道是想让她感觉好些吗？她后来才出现，为什么一开始不在场呢？

"Well you got there a bit late didn't you. If you had arrived maybe…before I was stabbed and left for dead, maybe Shinji wouldn't have been captured and maybe now I wouldn't feel immense pain with each movement. But never mind, better late than never I guess. So what did you find first when you got there, my pool of blood or the beacon powering down?"  
“好吧，你到得有点晚了，不是吗？如果你能早些到达……在我被刺伤等死之前，也许真嗣就不会被抓走，也许我现在就不会每动一下都感到剧痛。不过没关系，迟到总比不到好，我想。你到那里时，首先发现的是我的血泊，还是正在关闭的信号灯？”

Rei took a while to respond, eventually the response came sending a chill down Asuka's spine. "I found you…"  
绫波过了好一会儿才回应，最终的回答让明日香脊背发凉。“我找到了你……”

_20__th_ _September_ 9 月 20 日

**Tokyo 3 Park 东京 3 号公园**

Kaji turned into the park and moved swiftly towards the large group of people. Although he and the others were heavily wrapped up in locating Shinji Ikari, they still had other priorities, one of these being the search for Kaworou Nagisa, the president of the Marduk Institute. It was beginning to approach thirty days since Shinji had vanished and still they had found nothing. At that same time though, it was approaching nearly sixty since Nagisa had vanished and now the media had pounced on it.  
加持转向公园，迅速向人群聚集处移动。尽管他和同伴们全力搜寻碇真嗣，但还有其他优先事项，其中之一便是寻找马尔杜克机关的主席渚薰。自真嗣失踪已近三十天，却毫无线索。与此同时，渚薰失踪已近六十天，媒体对此紧追不舍。

That was the purpose of this event that had been set up, many people gathered had speculated as to the true purpose of it. Now that it wasn't a big secret that Nagisa was missing many people were wondering just what this meant for Marduk and the so called 'wonder vaccine' they were working on.  
这场集会的目的正是如此，许多人猜测其真实意图。如今渚薰失踪已非秘密，人们开始质疑这对马尔杜克机关及其所谓的‘奇迹疫苗’意味着什么。

Kaji himself wondered what this meant. From what he had gathered, Nagisa was SEELE's chosen front man. The puppet on the string so to speak, he would handle all the media attention and dealing with others while SEELE fed him instructions. Quite a comfortable job if you don't get on their bad side, Kaji thought to himself. Unfortunately for Nagisa that seemed to be the case.  
加治自己也疑惑这代表着什么。据他所知，渚薰是 SEELE 选定的前台人物。可以说是提线木偶，他负责应对所有媒体关注和与人打交道，而 SEELE 则向他下达指令。如果你不惹恼他们，这是一份相当舒适的工作，加治暗自思忖。不幸的是，对渚薰来说，情况似乎正是如此。

The problem lay there, if Nagisa did indeed get on their bad side then why would SEELE have disposed of him like this? Why would they have had him vanish without a trace? A sudden disappearance didn't make any sense, if SEELE were to have him killed they'd have it specially staged, not just him vanished. Too much was riding on Nagisa for him to vanish at a moment like this. Kaji was definitely sure there was more to this than Nagisa just getting on their bad side, there had to be and he intended to find it.  
问题就在这里，如果渚薰确实惹恼了他们，那么 SEELE 为何会这样处理他？为何会让他无影无踪地消失？突然失踪毫无意义，如果 SEELE 要杀他，他们会精心策划，而不是让他就这样消失。渚薰身上承载了太多，在这个节骨眼上消失实在说不通。加治确信，这背后一定有更深层次的原因，不仅仅是渚薰惹恼了他们，他决心要找出真相。

This open press conference today was supposed to be Marduk establishing what had happened with Nagisa and supposedly announcing replacements. It was these replacements that interested Kaji the most. It was not just one replacement but a team of replacements, a fact which interested him greatly. Would it not be easier for SEELE to control a single person than a group?  
今天的这场公开记者会，原本是 Marduk 要说明渚薰事件并宣布替补人选的。正是这些替补人选，最让加持感兴趣。不是单一个替补，而是一整队替补，这个事实让他格外关注。SEELE 控制一个人难道不比控制一群人容易吗？

Kaji became aware of a presence behind him and turned to find Asuka standing behind him. She glared up at the stage and the huge screen baring the Marduk Institute Logo, the octagonal logo with the words Marduk Institute wrapped around a symbol. It was a logo that she had seen hundreds of times, both on her investigations of Nagisa's disappearance and in general news stories featuring them.  
加持察觉到身后有人，转身发现是明日香站在那里。她怒视着舞台和那块巨大的屏幕，上面展示着 Marduk 研究所的标志——一个八角形图案，周围环绕着“Marduk 研究所”的字样和一个符号。这个标志她已见过无数次，无论是在调查渚薰失踪案时，还是在一般新闻报道中提及他们的时候。

She stared across at Kaji who seemed to be fixed on the logo, although there was a look of determination in his face like he was in deep thought about it. Asuka couldn't really understand why he had asked her to come here. Although she knew that the case on Nagisa was still open, she had thought the focus had shifted towards Shinji for now. It wasn't really the way she should be thinking, if anything the Nagisa case should have taken priority, but they were stuck on both fronts.  
她凝视着对面的加持，他似乎专注于那个标志，尽管脸上带着一种决心，仿佛在深思熟虑。明日香并不完全明白他为何要叫她来这里。虽然她知道关于渚薰的案件仍未结案，但她以为目前焦点已经转向了真嗣。这并不是她应该有的思考方式，无论如何，渚薰的案件本应优先，但他们现在两头都陷入了僵局。

"Kaji, why did you call me here?"  
“加持，你为什么叫我到这里来？”

"There's something I wanted you to see. Something which I think you'll find interesting."  
“有样东西我想让你看看。我觉得你会感兴趣的。”

"For the Nagisa case?" "关于渚的案子？"

Kaji nodded, "Perhaps…" 狩谷点头，"或许……"

"So is that a yes or a no?"  
"那是肯定还是否定？"

"Just watch, it's starting."  
“看好了，要开始了。”

Asuka turned her eyes back to the stage to see a woman in a black suit make her way towards the microphone and podium that had been set up. Towards the front of the crowd news crews excitedly prepared their cameras and reporters. Other areas of the crowd had their eyes fixed firmly on the woman wondering what would happen now.  
明日香将目光转回舞台，只见一位身着黑色西装的女性正走向设置好的麦克风和讲台。人群前排的新闻团队兴奋地准备着摄像机和记者。其他区域的观众则紧紧盯着那位女性，好奇接下来会发生什么。

A few moments passed and the woman finally began to speak,  
片刻之后，那位女性终于开始发言，

"Good evening, thank you to each and every one of you who has shown up on this day. Many of you are probably wondering why we are holding an event like this in public. We at Marduk decided that with everything that has been reported in the press for the past two months that it was time to set some things straight. Seeing as we are a very public company and we enjoy that relationship we have with the public we thought it best to settle this with an event like this as opposed to an event held behind closed doors from the desk of an executive."  
"晚上好，感谢每一位今天到场的朋友。你们中许多人或许好奇，为何我们选择在公共场合举办这样的活动。Marduk 公司认为，鉴于过去两个月媒体上的种种报道，是时候澄清一些事实了。鉴于我们是一家高度公开的公司，并且我们珍视与公众的关系，我们认为通过这样的公开活动来解决此事，比在高管办公室的闭门会议更为合适。"

She paused for a moment, taking time for everyone in the crowd to settle down, "Now, as I said there have been a lot of reports lately about the institute. The aim of this event is to put to rest some of the rumors that have been flying about. The first of which is the one which started all this controversy, the whereabouts of the man in charge of Marduk, Kaworou Nagisa."  
她停顿片刻，让人群中的每个人都安定下来，“正如我所说，最近关于研究所的报道很多。本次活动的目的，是为了平息一些流传的谣言。其中第一个，也是引发所有争议的源头，就是 Marduk 负责人 Kaworou Nagisa 的下落。”

Again there was a slight pause. Asuka fixed her eyes directly on the screen wishing she had never come here. Nagisa's disappearance was just another constant reminder that she was failing: Failing to find Nagisa, failing to find Shinji, failing to beat the Angels and ultimately failing to stop SEELE. She felt her fist clench slightly and her nails dig into the palms of her hand.  
又一次，出现了短暂的停顿。明日香直视着屏幕，真希望自己从未来过这里。渚的失踪不过是又一个不断提醒她失败的常数：找不到渚，找不到真嗣，打不败使徒，最终也无法阻止 Seele。她感到拳头微微握紧，指甲刺入了掌心。

"Kaji, I'm going to go home now…"  
“加持，我现在要回家了……”

She turned to leave as he grabbed her arm, "Wait, keep on watching."  
她转身要走，他却抓住了她的手臂，“等等，继续看。”

The woman at the front began speaking again, "A lot of papers and news shows reported that Mr. Nagisa had gone missing. I am pleased to report that these reports were in fact untrue."  
站在前排的女士再次开口，“许多报纸和新闻节目报道说长良先生失踪了。我很高兴地报告，这些报道实际上是不真实的。”

Asuka turned her head swiftly, glaring at the stage as the woman continued, "Mr. Nagisa was in fact at a research facility checking on the final stages of the vaccine to be released at the end of this year. Unfortunately, there was a communication problem hence why there has been no news on this until today. We would have said something earlier however we did not expect the huge media frenzy and due to the communication breakdown we ourselves were unsure of the situation."  
明日香迅速转头，瞪着台上的女士继续说道，“长良先生实际上是在一个研究设施中，检查今年年底即将发布的疫苗的最后阶段。不幸的是，由于沟通问题，直到今天才有了相关消息。我们本想早点说些什么，但我们没有预料到如此巨大的媒体狂潮，而且由于沟通中断，我们自己也不确定情况。”

Asuka stared on at the crowd of reporters, who began muttering amongst themselves. She turned to Kaji who was glaring onwards, awaiting her to say something. She couldn't quite believe what she was hearing, did that mean that the entire Nagisa case, Carter being assigned to them, and Shinji being abducted was for nothing? Nagisa was alive and well and they were just being led on?  
明日香盯着那群开始窃窃私语的记者们，她转向正在瞪着前方的加持，等待她发表意见。她几乎无法相信自己所听到的，这是否意味着整个长良案件，卡特被分配给他们，以及真嗣被绑架，都是徒劳的？长良安然无恙，而他们只是被牵着鼻子走？

That couldn't be the case, though she thought to herself, Marduk themselves had contacted NERV. They had cooperated with them. They had given them the video camera footage. Why would they make this entire thing up? Why would they stage a disappearance like this?  
然而，她心中暗想，马杜克自己都联系了 NERV。他们曾与他们合作。他们提供了视频监控录像。他们为何要编造这一切？为何要策划这样一场失踪事件？

She felt anger inside her, yet another common feeling of the last few weeks. Everything she was doing just seemed to have no purpose. It was as if she was just being set up to fail and look worthless in front of everyone. She restrained herself from doing anything and continued watching the conference, one of the news reporters had just called out a question she too would like to know the answer too.  
她感到内心愤怒，这是过去几周里又一个常见的情绪。她所做的一切似乎都毫无意义。仿佛她被设定好要失败，要在众人面前显得无用。她克制住自己不做任何事，继续观看发布会，其中一位新闻记者刚刚提出了一个她也很想知道答案的问题。

"What about the NERV Agents who were spotted investigating the Marduk Building? What was their purpose there?"  
“那些被发现在马杜克大楼调查的 NERV 特工呢？他们在那里的目的是什么？”

The woman cleanly smiled and responded into the microphone, "I'm afraid you have been misinformed, there was no investigation by NERV or otherwise."  
那女人干净利落地微笑着，对着麦克风回应道：“恐怕您是得到了错误的信息，NERV 或其他机构并未进行任何调查。”

"That lying bitch, how can she stand there and say that after the effort we put into this?"  
“那个撒谎的婊子，我们付出了这么多努力，她怎么还能站在那里这么说？”

"Marduk is on SEELE's payroll Asuka. That's how she can stand there and say that."  
“Marduk 是 SEELE 的雇员，明日香。这就是她能站在那里说那番话的原因。”

"What…what do you mean?" "什么……你是什么意思？"

"I wanted you to be here to see this announcement and what happens next. Most of these journalists, they'll accept this easily. Marduk is the one thing in this world that can deliver hope, look at all they've done. We can see how feeble it is but everyone here will eat it up. They will believe that Nagisa is away somewhere working on something."  
"我希望你能在这里见证这个公告以及接下来发生的事情。大多数记者，他们会轻易接受这一点。马尔杜克是这个世界上唯一能带来希望的东西，看看他们所做的一切。我们能看到它是多么脆弱，但这里的每个人都会欣然接受。他们会相信 Nagisa 在某个地方忙于某项工作。"

"Did you know they'd announce this?"  
"你知道他们会宣布这个吗？"

"I've been investigating SEELE for years Asuka, trying to find something to aid us in our fight against them. Ikari and Fuyutsuki can only do so much, I know it sounds weird but everything they have done…all the manipulation, all the hiding in shadows, you'll understand why they have to do that. We're the good guys Asuka."  
"我已经调查 SEELE 多年了，明日香，试图找到能帮助我们对抗他们的线索。碇和冬月只能做这么多，我知道这听起来很奇怪，但他们所做的一切……所有的操纵，所有的藏身暗处，你会明白他们为何必须这么做。我们是好人，明日香。"

"If they're the good guys then why don't they just come clean with what's happening? Why do they always have to operate like they do?"  
"如果他们是好人，那为什么不直接坦白正在发生的事？为什么他们总是要像现在这样行事？"

"Because not even they know just how far SEELE's power extends. The Marduk Institute is just another front for SEELE. They're controlling it and for some reason they wanted to get rid of Nagisa. Now they have us thinking he's in a research facility but it's not true, we need to find him. If we do then he can lead us to Shinji."  
"因为他们甚至不知道 SEELE 的权力究竟延伸到何种程度。马尔杜克机构只是 SEELE 的另一个幌子。他们控制着它，出于某种原因他们想要除掉渚。现在他们让我们以为他在一个研究设施里，但这不是真的，我们需要找到他。如果我们找到了，他就能带我们找到真嗣。"

Asuka thought on his words for a moment and then the questioning of the woman stopped, she announced boldly to the rest of the people. "Okay, that's enough questions for now. If you have more then please save them for a few minutes time. I have just been informed that we have been linked up with the research facility and Nagisa himself."  
明日香对他的话沉思片刻，随后那位女士的提问停止了，她大胆地向其他人宣布。“好了，现在的问题就到此为止。如果还有更多疑问，请稍后再提。我刚刚得知，我们已经与研究设施建立了联系，直面了渚本人。”

The screen with the Marduk logo on it began to flicker slightly as they began the video feed. It was quickly replaced by the image of Kaworou Nagisa looking directly into a camera and smiling slightly. Asuka almost shivered as she looked at his eyes, she got a feeling that even though he was probably thousands of miles away he was directly in front of her.  
带有马尔杜克标志的屏幕开始微微闪烁，随着视频信号的启动，很快被一张川原渚直视摄像头的画面所取代，他微微一笑。明日香几乎打了个寒颤，看着他的眼睛，她有种感觉，尽管他可能远在千里之外，却仿佛就在她面前。

This didn't make sense though, didn't Kaji just say it was a pretense and a lie that Nagisa was actually missing? She turned to Kaji who seemed to be lost for words, he turned around and began moving away. Asuka quickly caught up with him and demanded to know what was happening. "What the hell was that Kaji? I thought they were supposed to be lying?"  
但这说不通啊，不是刚刚才说渚失踪是借口和谎言吗？她转向加持，后者似乎无言以对，转身开始离开。明日香迅速追上他，要求知道发生了什么。“那到底是怎么回事，加持？我以为他们应该是在撒谎？”

"I don't know Asuka, I really don't know…"  
"我不知道，Asuka，我真的不知道……"

He trailed off as she looked up at the stage, her eyes fixed on another person this time. She turned to Kaji who had started to walk away again, "Wait a minute, who is that on the stage?"  
他话音未落，只见她抬头望向舞台，这次目光锁定在另一个人身上。她转向已经再次开始走开的加持，问道：“等一下，台上那个人是谁？”

He took a quick look at the person and shook his head, "I don't know, I assumed it was one of the people who were supposed to be taking over operations here but now that Nagisa seems to be safe and well, I don't know anymore."  
他迅速瞥了一眼那个人，摇了摇头，“我不清楚，我以为是要接管这里操作的人之一，但现在看来 Nagisa 似乎安然无恙，我也不确定了。”

She watched Kaworou speaking to the crowd and then make reference to the people, "Unfortunately I will be unable to make it back here until the unveiling of the vaccine. Due to this I will be handing over control of the Marduk Tokyo 3 office to the three people sitting on the stage. The first of which is, a man who has worked on several projects for Marduk in the past, Dr. Benjamin Mittelos."  
她看着卡沃罗向人群讲话，然后提到那些人，“遗憾的是，在疫苗揭幕之前，我将无法回到这里。因此，我将把 Marduk 东京 3 号办公室的控制权交给坐在台上的三个人。首先是，过去曾为 Marduk 负责过多个项目的本杰明·米特洛斯博士。”

There was a pause as the crowd applauded. Once the applause had died down Nagisa continued. "The second person is someone who was working in Marduk's American Office, a prominent figure in the area of fertility and stem cell research, 'Dr Juliette Widmore.'"  
人群鼓掌时停顿了一下。掌声平息后，渚继续说道：“第二位是在 Marduk 美国办公室工作的人，在生育和干细胞研究领域颇具影响力的人物，‘朱丽叶特·威德莫博士’。”

The crowd applauded again as they got to the final person the person Asuka was most interested in. There was something about the woman that she couldn't quite place like she had seen the person before.  
当提到最后一个人，也是明日香最感兴趣的那个人时，人群再次鼓掌。关于这个女人，明日香总觉得似曾相识，但又说不清楚在哪里见过。

"And now to the final person, this person has been an influential part of Marduk for the past few years. She is one of the key members of the team for the vaccine to be released, 'Megumi Seki.'"  
“而现在，让我们迎来最后一位人物，这位在过去几年中一直是 Marduk 的重要影响者。她是即将发布的疫苗团队的关键成员之一，‘惠美濑木’。”

The crowd applauded again as Asuka tried to remember where she had seen the person before. As the person stood and made there way towards the microphone it suddenly hit her, _'She was the person meeting with Nagisa on the day he supposedly vanished!'_  
人群再次鼓掌，而明日香努力回忆她曾在哪里见过这个人。当那人起身走向麦克风时，她突然想起来了，‘她就是那天与渚会面的人，就在他据称失踪的那天！’

_25__th_ _September 2015_ 2015 年 9 月 25 日

**NERV Offices – 1700 hours  
NERV 办公室 —— 17 时整**

"He can't do this, we still haven't found him yet!" Asuka shouted, not quite believing what she had just been told.  
“他不能这么做，我们还没找到他呢！”明日香喊道，几乎不敢相信刚刚被告知的消息。

Fuyutsuki shook his head and responded back to her, "That's precisely why he is doing this Sohryu, like it or not we're still here to do a job. What happened to Ikari is unfortunate but after thirty days finding nothing we cannot afford to waste more resources on chasing after shadows. We still have a duty to fill as Agents here."  
冬月摇了摇头，回应她：“这正是他这么做的原因，惣流，不管你喜不喜欢，我们还有任务要完成。碇的失踪固然不幸，但三十天一无所获后，我们不能再浪费更多资源去追逐幻影。作为这里的特工，我们还有职责要履行。”

Asuka lowered her head and prepared to shout a response back at the old man only to have Misato cut her off, "I understand, we will comply with your order."  
明日香低下头，正准备朝那老头大喊回应，却被美里抢先一步，“我明白了，我们会遵从您的命令。”

"Good, I apologize for what has happened but you must understand Ikari knew the risks when he joined NERV…"  
“很好，我为发生的事情道歉，但你们必须明白，碇真嗣加入 NERV 时就知道其中的风险……”

"He didn't know that he would be used as a pawn in some stupid game between the director and some committee hell bent on taking us over though. A risk is getting shot and killed deputy director, not being turned into a human weapon."  
“他可不知道自己会被卷入主任和某个一心想接管我们的委员会之间的愚蠢游戏中，成为一枚棋子。风险是中弹身亡，副指挥官，而不是被变成人形武器。”

"I understand you must be angry Sohryu, but it is out of our hands now. Please do not go searching for him, there is nothing more that can be done."  
"我知道你一定很生气，双龙，但现在我们无能为力了。请不要去找他，已经没有什么能做的了。"

Misato bowed her head and spoke, "Will…will there be a service for him?"  
美里低下头，问道：“会……会为他举行葬礼吗？”

Fuyutsuki nodded, "Yes there will in a few weeks. Please forgive me, I have some work to do."  
冬月点头道：“是的，几周后会有的。请原谅，我有些工作要做。”

Fuyutsuki left the room, leaving Misato to deal with a fuming Asuka. It was so hard to believe, thirty days had passed and he was still gone and now it looked like he was gone for good. Misato felt numb, she didn't know whether she should just walk away or fall to her knees crying. She looked across at Asuka whose eyes were fixed directly on her, a disgusted look across her face.  
冬月离开了房间，留下美里面对怒气冲冲的明日香。难以置信，三十天过去了，他依然杳无音讯，现在看来他似乎永远消失了。美里感到麻木，不知是该转身离开还是跪地痛哭。她望向明日香，她的目光直勾勾地盯着她，脸上满是厌恶的表情。

"How…how could you let them stop us so easily?"  
“怎……怎么可能这么轻易就被他们阻止了？”

"We don't have a choice Asuka, we spent thirty days trying and found nothing. We failed. We don't have a lead. We don't have anything to show for it except an empty desk."  
“我们别无选择，明日香，我们已经努力了三十天，一无所获。我们失败了。没有线索，除了那张空桌子，我们什么都没有。”

Asuka winced at the word 'failed'. It felt worse than when she had been stabbed, "Don't tell me I've failed, I'm not giving up on this."  
听到'失败'这个词，明日香皱了皱眉。这感觉比她被刺伤时还要糟糕，“别告诉我我失败了，我不会就此放弃的。”

"Asuka please, if you do anything you'll only make it worse. What can you do? We've already tried everything."  
“明日香，求你了，如果你再做什么只会让情况更糟。你还能做什么呢？我们已经尝试了一切。”

Asuka shouted back, "We haven't tried anything Misato, from the very beginning of this we were just set up to fail. I can't accept that, there's one place we haven't looked yet, one place I keep on mentioning but everyone ignores it."  
明日香大声反驳道，“我们根本没尝试过任何东西，美里，从一开始我们就注定要失败。我无法接受这一点，还有一个地方我们没去看过，一个我一直在提但大家都忽视的地方。”

"You know why it's ignored Asuka if you go there it's…its suicide."  
"你知道为什么忽视明日香去那里就是……自杀。"

"How do we know that Misato?" Asuka demanded, "Because we were told that? Well how fucking convenient, just like everything else about what's going on here."  
"我们怎么知道是 Misato 说的？" 明日香质问道，"就因为我们被告知了？真是太他妈方便了，就像这里发生的其他一切一样。"

"We don't but that doesn't mean you should risk your life like that, Shinji wouldn't want you to."  
"我们不确定，但这并不意味着你应该冒这样的生命危险，真嗣不会希望你这样的。"

Misato reached her arm out to try to calm the red head down only to have it viciously swiped away as Asuka stood up yelling at her, "To hell with what Shinji would want."  
美里伸出手试图安抚红发少女，却被对方猛地挥开，明日香站起身来对她吼道：“去他的真嗣会怎么想！”

Asuka felt tears threatening to form in her eyes, she blinked them away angrily before continuing to yell. "You and the rest of them can believe he's gone but I'm not giving up. I'm not losing this time."  
明日香感到泪水即将涌出，她愤怒地眨眼将其逼回，继续吼道：“你们和其他人都相信他走了，但我不会放弃。这次我不会输。”

_26__th_ _August 2015_ 2015 年 8 月 26 日  
**Mt Asama 浅间山**

"Mother…?" "妈妈…？"

Asuka opened her eyes slowly at the sound of his voice. She looked up and saw him staring up at the huge craft above them. In front of him she could make out the ghostly form of someone else.  
听到他的声音，明日香缓缓睁开眼睛。她抬头望去，只见他正凝视着他们上方巨大的飞行器。在他面前，明日香隐约看到了另一个幽灵般的身影。

She tried to move but felt an immense pain shoot through her body. She turned her head and saw the blood trickling out of her, seeping out of the wound from where Carter had wounded her. She tried to lift her head again to try to get Shinji's attention, to try to take him away from whoever the figure was.  
她试图移动，却感到一阵剧痛贯穿全身。她转过头，看见鲜血从自己体内缓缓流出，渗出卡特所伤的伤口。她再次努力抬起头，试图引起真嗣的注意，想把他从那个身影身边带走。

Maybe there wasn't even a figure there, maybe it was just a strange hallucination. Asuka had died when she was wounded and this was some strange type of afterlife. She watched as Shinji turned and noticed her. He quickly made his way over to her. She could see the blood on his hands and on his clothes, had he taken care of Carter?  
也许那里根本没有人影，或许这只是个奇怪的幻觉。明日香在受伤时已经死去，这可能是某种奇怪的来世。她看着真嗣转身注意到她。他迅速向她走来。她能看到他手上的血迹和衣服上的血迹，他处理了卡特吗？

He knelt down near her and lifted her head up, gently resting it on his knee. It was so warm she thought to herself like she could stay there forever. She gazed up into his eyes and noticed faint tears rolling down his cheeks and splashing onto her own body.  
他在她身边跪下，轻轻抬起她的头，温柔地放在自己的膝盖上。那里如此温暖，她心想自己可以永远待在那里。她凝视着他的眼睛，注意到他脸颊上淡淡的泪珠滚落，溅在自己的身上。

"Shinji…what's happening?" She whispered to him hoarsely.  
"真嗣…发生了什么？" 她嘶哑地向他低语。

He gently stroked her cheek as he responded, "I…It'll be alright Asuka, nothing's going to happen. I'm here with you."  
他温柔地抚摸着她的脸颊，回应道："我…会没事的，明日香，什么都不会发生。我在这里陪着你。"

She gazed firmly into his eyes and weakly began to lift her arm to caress him cheek. As she did so she felt her own tears rolling down her face mixing with his. Weakly, she closed her eyes, nearly passing out from the constant pain she was in and waited for Shinji to help her. A few moments passed and nothing happened. Weakly, she re-opened her eyes. Everything had gone, the lights, the craft, the rumbling of the engines and most importantly to her, Shinji.  
她坚定地凝视着他的眼睛，虚弱地开始抬起手臂去抚摸他的脸颊。就在这时，她感觉到自己的泪水顺着脸颊滑落，与他的泪水混合在一起。她虚弱地闭上眼睛，几乎因持续的疼痛而昏厥，等待着真嗣的帮助。片刻过去，什么也没有发生。她虚弱地再次睁开眼睛。一切都消失了，灯光、飞行器、引擎的轰鸣声，最重要的是，真嗣也不见了。

It had all vanished and she was left there on the side of the mountain wounded and alone. She waited a few moments hoping that maybe he would be back, but with each moment she felt herself slipping away more and more. This was it she thought to herself, her luck had finally run out and no one would be there to rescue her.  
一切都消失了，她独自一人受伤地留在山腰。她等待了片刻，希望他或许会回来，但随着每一刻的流逝，她感到自己越来越远离这个世界。这就是她心中所想的结局，她的运气终于耗尽，没有人会来救她了。

'_So…this is how it ends for the great Asuka Langley Sohryu…left alone on the side of a mountain bleeding to death…guess I'll be coming to see you soon mother…'_  
'所以……这就是伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷的结局……孤独地死在山腰上……我想我很快就会来见你了，妈妈……'

She blinked twice as she noticed another figure move into her view, it didn't matter though. Whoever it was, they were too late. She was already dead, it would just be futile to help her now. It was strange though, there was almost something familiar about the person as if they had met before.  
她眨了两次眼，注意到另一个身影进入了她的视线，但这已经无关紧要了。无论来者是谁，都为时已晚。她已经死了，现在帮助她只是徒劳。不过，这个人似乎有些熟悉，仿佛他们曾经见过。

'_Guess this is my life flashing before my eyes part…not quite what I expected…I hate this world.'_  
'看来这就是我眼前闪现一生片段的时刻了……和我想象的不太一样……我讨厌这个世界。'

**Misato's Residence – 2000 hours  
美里住所 – 晚上八点**

"Asuka was really upset at what happened back at NERV..."  
“明日香对之前在 NERV 发生的事情真的很生气……”

Misato shifted slightly, moving herself up into a sitting position as she gazed out of the window. She had been thinking about what had happened back at NERV for the past few hours. Why did she accept it so easily? Did she really believe Shinji was dead and would never return? Or was it just a convenience, an easy way out so that she didn't have to worry about finding him in an even worse condition?  
美里微微挪动身体，坐起身来，凝视着窗外。过去的几个小时里，她一直在思考在 NERV 发生的事情。为什么她会如此轻易地接受这个事实？她真的相信真嗣已经死了，再也不会回来了吗？还是说这只是一种便利，一种逃避的方式，让她不必担心找到他时情况可能更糟？

'_Asuka was disgusted with the way I acted back there…I can't blame her really, after all I put her through with Leliel and to just accept he's dead so easily…I'm disgusted with myself.'_  
'明日香对我在那里的行为感到厌恶……我不能怪她，毕竟我让她经历了与雷利尔的一切，然后又如此轻易地接受他死了……我对自己感到厌恶。'

It was still hard for her to believe though that in NERV's eyes he was gone, it was so unfair that given the circumstances they would just tell them to give up like that. Even if they hadn't given up though, she had to wonder what exactly could have been done. Shinji had not been captured by terrorists and taken to a remote location miles away from Tokyo 3. He had been ripped from the Earth, taken up. Maybe it would be best to think of him as dead, there was no way they could get him back now.  
尽管如此，她仍然难以相信在 NERV 看来他已经消失了，这种情况下他们竟然就这样告诉他们放弃，实在太不公平了。即使他们没有放弃，她也不得不怀疑究竟还能做些什么。真嗣并非被恐怖分子绑架并带到了远离第三新东京市的地方。他是被从地球上撕裂，带走了。也许最好把他当作已经死去，现在他们已经无法再找回他了。

'_I can't do anything anyway…soon I'm going to have to stop working…I have other things to think about. What use am I going to be then? I won't be able to help them, and even now I'm restricted because of the security placed on me.'_  
“反正我也做不了什么……很快我就得停止工作……我还有其他事情要考虑。到那时我还有什么用呢？我帮不了他们，甚至现在也因为加在我身上的安全措施而受限。”

Misato looked out across the skyline trying to find said 'security'. She knew it was useless, Ayanami would be too well hidden. It was a scary thought though, that even though Ayanami was supposed to be protecting her she didn't even know where Ayanami was. She didn't even know why Ayanami was protecting her, were they expecting another angel attack? Or was Shinji right about her baby, was it really too good to be true?  
美里眺望着天际，试图找到所谓的‘安全措施’。她知道这是徒劳的，绫波一定隐藏得太好了。尽管如此，想到即使绫波本应保护她，她却连绫波在哪里都不知道，这想法令人恐惧。她甚至不知道绫波为何要保护她，是预料到会有另一次使徒袭击吗？还是真嗣说得对，她的孩子真的好得令人难以置信？

'_I hate this world…'_ “我讨厌这个世界……”

**Asuka's Residence – 2000 hours  
明日香的家 —— 晚上八点**

Asuka looked at herself in the mirror, her own gaunt expression staring back at her. Underneath her rain soaked shirt she could make out the scarring from where she had been stabbed exactly thirty days ago. By the man that had caused her to lose the one thing she really had in this world.  
明日香对着镜子端详自己，镜中映出的是她憔悴的面容。在湿透的衬衫下，她能清晰看到三十天前被刺伤留下的疤痕。那个男人，夺走了她在这个世界上唯一真正拥有的东西。

She looked around her bedroom. It was still incomplete after what had happened. Some of the furniture had been put up by Kaji but the rest was in boxes downstairs. She still kept on expecting Shinji to phone her or to go into NERV the next day and find him there. That's why she wouldn't let Kaji put it all together, Shinji had promised her that he would and she wanted to ensure he kept that promise.  
她环顾自己的卧室，一切仍未恢复原样。部分家具是加持帮忙摆放的，其余的还装在楼下的箱子里。她总期待着真嗣能打电话来，或是第二天去 NERV 时能见到他。正因为如此，她不让加持把所有东西都整理好，真嗣曾向她承诺过会亲自完成，她想确保他履行这个承诺。

It still hadn't hit her fully, the realization that he wasn't coming back. That whoever had him was not going to let him come back and had most likely killed him, at least those had been the Director's words. As far as NERV and the case were concerned Shinji was killed in the line of duty. They had even gone as far as announcing there would be a memorial service for him in a week or so.  
她仍未完全接受这个事实，他不会再回来了。无论是谁抓了他，都不会让他回来，很可能已经杀了他，至少这是导演的话。就 NERV 和案件而言，真嗣是在执行任务时牺牲的。他们甚至宣布将在一周左右为他举行追悼会。

The very thought of it made her sick to her stomach, each and everyone of them, they all knew he wasn't dead yet they accepted it so easily and she hated them for it. How could they just accept it so easily? How could they ignore all the work that she had done and ignore her pleas to attempt to infiltrate the site SEELE had set up? She was getting ignored all because they want to just pretend Shinji had died as a hero.  
一想到这，她就感到胃里一阵恶心，他们每一个人，明明都知道他还没死，却如此轻易地接受了这一点，她为此憎恨他们。他们怎么能这么轻易接受？怎么能无视她所做的一切努力，无视她请求渗透 SEELE 设立的基地的恳求？她被忽视，只因为他们想假装真嗣是作为一个英雄死去的。

She was getting ignored because she had failed once again, just like she had every other time. She had promised she would return him and had come up with nothing. She turned from the mirror and slammed her hand against the wall shouting out, "I hate them all."  
她被忽视是因为她又一次失败了，就像她每次都失败一样。她曾承诺会带他回来，却一无所获。她转身离开镜子，一拳砸在墙上，喊道：“我恨他们所有人。”

She hit it again and shouted once more, "I hate Ayanami."  
她再次击打，又一次喊道：“我讨厌绫波。”

Again, "I hate Katsuragi."  
又一次，“我讨厌葛城。”

Again, "I hate NERV." 又一次，“我讨厌 NERV。”

"I hate Shinji." "我讨厌真嗣。"

She hit it again but this time sank to her knees letting out a sob, "I hate…I hate myself…"  
她再次击打，但这次跪倒在地，放声痛哭，“我恨……我恨我自己……”

### Chapter 25 Objects In The Rear View Mirror

A chill ran through her as she felt the coldness of the floor tiles beneath her bare feet. As she walked down the long corridor, the heavy smell of disinfectant filled her nostrils, it was a smell that made her sick to her stomach. It was a smell that was very familiar to her, one that brought back a thousand memories. Asuka shivered and continued making her way down the corridor.  
当她赤脚感受到地板瓷砖的冰冷时，一股寒意贯穿全身。她沿着长长的走廊走去，浓重的消毒水味充斥鼻腔，这味道让她恶心欲呕。这种气味对她来说再熟悉不过，它唤起了她无数的回忆。明日香颤抖着，继续沿着走廊前行。

She couldn't remember how long she had been walking for, it seemed like it had been forever, yet the corridor didn't seem to have an end. It just stretched on and on eventually plunging into darkness. She carried on walking, curiosity urging her to continue. She didn't take any notice of the doors on either side, only noticing that each one was identical and had some sort of indistinguishable writing next to them. It didn't matter though, all she wanted to know was what was at the end, just wanting to know where the corridor led to.  
她记不清自己走了多久，仿佛已经过了永恒，然而走廊似乎没有尽头。它只是无限延伸，最终陷入黑暗。她继续前行，好奇心驱使她继续探索。她没有注意到两侧的门，只注意到每一扇门都一模一样，旁边有些难以辨认的文字。但这无关紧要，她只想知道走廊的尽头是什么，只想知道这条走廊通向何方。

She was vaguely aware of a faint beeping noise in the distance, like the sound of an EKG Machine. As she continued moving the sound grew louder and louder. This must be it, she thought to herself. She must be reaching her destination now, she must be close to whatever it was she was trying to find.  
她隐约察觉到远处传来微弱的哔哔声，像是心电监护仪的声音。随着她继续前行，这声音越来越响。这一定是了，她暗自思忖。她现在一定快到达目的地了，一定接近她试图寻找的东西了。

Finally she could see something coming into view. As she got closer she noticed the machine noise had changed, it was no longer the steady beep but now the dull thud of what seemed to be a heart beat. The object came more and more distinguishable and she saw that it was a young girl in a yellow sundress. She had long flowing red hair and was clutching a small teddy bear.  
终于，她能看到一些东西逐渐进入视野。随着她越来越近，她注意到机器的声音变了，不再是稳定的声音，而是现在似乎是心跳的沉闷声。物体越来越清晰，她看到那是一个穿着黄色太阳裙的小女孩。她有着长长的飘逸红发，紧抱着一只小泰迪熊。

Asuka felt a strange sense of dread as she approached the small girl, she couldn't have been much older than eight. What was she doing alone in a place like this? She knelt down beside her, "Excuse me, what are you doing here. A little girl like you shouldn't be alone in a place like this."  
明日香走近这个小女孩时，感到一种莫名的恐惧，她看起来不超过八岁。她一个人在这种地方做什么？她蹲在她旁边，"对不起，你在这里做什么。像你这样的小女孩不应该一个人在这种地方。"

The girl replied back forcefully, "I'm not a little girl, my mama told me so. I'm here to visit her but she won't talk to me."  
女孩坚定地回道：“我不是小孩子，我妈妈说的。我来找她，但她不理我。”

The little girl's mother, is that why Asuka was walking down here? Was that it? She couldn't remember why she was here or even how she had gotten here. That must have been it though, she was investigating something and it led her here. She smiled at the child and spoke again, "Could you please show me where your mama is, I'd like to see her."  
这个小女孩的母亲，这就是为什么明日香会来这里吗？是这个原因吗？她记不清自己为何来此，甚至怎么来的也忘了。但肯定是这样，她在调查某件事，结果来到了这里。她对女孩微笑着再次开口：“你能带我去找你妈妈吗？我想见见她。”

"Are you Asuka?" “你是明日香吗？”

Asuka felt a sharp pang in her stomach, almost like it was alerting her to leave, but she didn't. She ignored it and nodded, "Yes that's right. How did you know?"  
明日香感到一阵剧烈的胃痛，仿佛在提醒她离开，但她没有。她忽略了这种感觉，点头道：“是的，没错。你怎么知道的？”

"The doctors said mama was asking for you, are you here to make her better again?"  
“医生说妈妈在找你，你是来让她再次好起来的吗？”

Asuka nodded smiling, "Yes, yes I am."  
明日香微笑着点头，“是的，是的，我就是。”

The girl smiled and nodded and began to run down the corridor, Asuka called for her to wait up but it was to no avail. She stood up and followed her down the corridor, she stopped just as she got to the end but the little girl had vanished. Asuka heard a door closing but couldn't see any that had closed. She examined the writing next to each one, most of it just seemed to be gibberish except for one name plate. There was a patients name on this, Asuka wiped away the dirt on it and read the name out in her mind.  
女孩微笑着点头，随即沿着走廊奔跑起来，明日香呼唤她停下来，但无济于事。她站起身，跟着女孩跑向走廊尽头，就在她到达终点时，小女孩却消失了。明日香听到一扇门关闭的声音，却看不到任何一扇门是关着的。她检查了每扇门旁的文字，大部分似乎都是胡言乱语，除了一个名牌。上面写着一位病人的名字，明日香擦去上面的灰尘，在心中默念这个名字。

"_K. Zeppelin. Sohryu"_ “K. 齐柏林. 惣流”

Asuka stepped back, her eyes wide with shock. She told herself it wasn't possible, that it was just a sick joke or something. She stepped back, feeling nauseous and trying to catch her breath. Just as she turned she found herself face to face with the little girl again, the girl spoke.  
明日香后退一步，眼中满是震惊。她告诉自己这不可能，只是个恶作剧或者别的什么。她感到恶心，试图喘口气。就在她转身时，再次与小女孩面对面，女孩开口说话了。

"What are you waiting for? Mama is waiting for you."  
"你在等什么？妈妈在等你。"

"I…I…what is this?" Asuka stammered out.  
"我……我……这是什么？" 明日香结结巴巴地说道。"

The girl didn't reply, instead she ran past Asuka into the room. Asuka stood and faced the door way. It was dark inside and she couldn't see the girl or anything else in there. She took a deep breath and stepped inside only to find nothing there. The door closed behind her leaving her in total darkness.  
女孩没有回答，而是从明日香身边跑进了房间。明日香站在那里，面对着门口。里面一片漆黑，她看不见女孩或任何其他东西。她深吸一口气，踏了进去，却发现里面空无一物。门在她身后关上，将她留在完全的黑暗中。

A woman's voice echoed around the room, "That's the one, she's the one who stands there and laughs at you, Asuka…"  
一个女人的声音在房间里回荡，“就是她，她就是那个站在那里嘲笑你的人，明日香……”

Asuka walked forward and whispered, "Mama?"  
明日香走上前，低声问道：“妈妈？”

The voice echoed around the room again, "There she is, it's her fault, she's to blame for this, Asuka."  
那个声音再次在房间里回响，“她在那儿，都是她的错，这一切都怪她，明日香。”

Asuka screamed out "No, please don't say this…not again."  
明日香尖叫道：“不，请不要这么说……不要再这样了。”

"It's her fault we're like this."  
“这都是她的错，我们才会变成这样。”

"No, it's not my fault, please I just didn't want you to leave me."  
“不，这不是我的错，请听我说，我只是不想你离开我。”

"Die with me." "和我一起死吧。"

Those three words echoed around the room repeatedly, each time though it got louder almost as if they were being repeated. Asuka put her hands over her ears but could still hear them.  
这三个字在房间里回荡，每次重复都变得更加响亮，仿佛有人在不断重复它们。明日香用手捂住耳朵，但仍然能听到。

"No, please I don't want this."  
"不，求求你，我不想这样。"

"Please, die with me Asuka…we can be together again."  
"请和我一起死吧，明日香……我们能再次在一起。"

"No…I won't I don't want to die…"  
"不……我不想死……"

Asuka looked up and there was a faint light shining, she could she a figure hanging from a rope. She shut her eyes tightly and screamed out, "No, I don't want this, stop this now!"  
明日香抬头望去，只见一缕微光中，有个人影悬吊在绳索上。她紧闭双眼，尖叫道：“不，我不想要这样，快停下来！”

_30__th_ _September 2015_ 2015 年 9 月 30 日

**Asuka's Residence – 0415 hours  
明日香的家 —— 凌晨 04:15**

Asuka's eyes shot open as she lurched forward in her bed, her body covered in a cold sweat. She felt a nauseous feeling rising through her as she quickly dashed into the bathroom, just making it in time to throw up the contents of her stomach into the toilet bowl. She wiped her mouth, flushed the contents away and moved over to the sink to wash her face.  
明日香猛地从床上坐起，全身冷汗淋漓。她感到一阵恶心涌上心头，迅速冲进浴室，刚好来得及将胃里的东西吐进马桶。她擦了擦嘴，冲掉秽物，走到洗手池旁洗脸。

Her face was pale and gaunt, this had been the fifth night in a row she had had the same nightmare. Each night it had been identical, it was beginning to haunt her. She had lost so much sleep over it, she was sure she was beginning to go insane.  
她的面容苍白而憔悴，这已经是连续第五个夜晚她重复着同一个噩梦。每晚都如出一辙，开始萦绕在她心头。她为此失去了太多睡眠，确信自己正逐渐陷入疯狂。

"Stupid Shinji, if he was here it wouldn't…"  
“笨蛋真嗣，如果他在的话就不会……”

She felt tears rolling down her cheeks as she thought of Shinji, this moment had been the same each of the past five nights as well. She wanted him to be there so much, to hold her, to comfort her but it was impossible. He was gone and she was alone. What was the old saying she had once heard? 'Live Together, Die Alone?'  
她感到泪水顺着脸颊滑落，每当想到真嗣，这一幕在过去五个夜晚里都如出一辙。她多么希望他在那里，拥抱她，安慰她，但这是不可能的。他已经离去，而她孤身一人。她曾听过的一句老话是什么来着？‘同生共死，孤独终老？’

It seemed pretty apt now. They had both lived together, albeit not for a long time, and with the way things were going she was going to die alone. If it wasn't from an Angel, Asuka felt she was going to suffer the same fate as her mother. She shuddered with the thought of it.  
现在看来颇为贴切。他们曾共同生活过，虽然时间不长，但照目前的情况发展下去，她注定要孤独终老。如果不是被使徒所杀，明日香觉得她可能会重蹈母亲的覆辙。想到这里，她不禁打了个寒颤。

'_No…I'm not going to do that, I'm not that bad, I just need to focus. Focus on this other stuff. Shinji will return I know it, he always does, I don't need him down here. I'm Asuka Langley Sohryu for crying out loud, I can't let this affect me. So I had a nightmare about my mother, I'm under pressure its normal I just need to block it out. That's what I've done all my life, blocked it out. To let it show, that's weakness, I can't be weak that's not who I am. I have a duty to do, I must beat the Angels, I must protect Misato.'_  
'不……我不会那样做的，我还没那么糟糕，我只需要集中注意力。专注于其他事情。我知道真嗣会回来的，他总是会回来，我不需要他在这里。我是明日香·兰格雷，拜托，我不能让这些影响我。我梦见了母亲，我压力很大，这很正常，我只需要把它屏蔽掉。这就是我一直以来所做的，屏蔽掉这些。让它显现出来，那是软弱，我不能软弱，那不是我。我有职责在身，我必须击败使徒，我必须保护美里。'

**NERV Offices – 1145 hours  
NERV 办公室 – 上午 11 点 45 分**

Asuka sat, a look of fierce determination on her face. She was not going to be beaten this time. She had made her mind up. It was a new dawning for her, a time for change. She had let her guard down. Allowed people inside those walls and she had learnt from her mistake, she wasn't going to allow it to happen again. This time she was going to be tougher and firmer.  
明日香坐下，脸上带着坚定的表情。这次她不会被打败。她已经下定决心。对她来说，这是一个新的开始，一个改变的时刻。她曾经放松了警惕，让一些人进入了她的内心世界，她从错误中吸取了教训，不会再让这种情况发生。这次，她会更加坚强和坚定。

Of course, this wasn't exactly going to plan. Being tougher and firmer wasn't exactly an easy job when dealing with Misato Katsuragi. She looked across at Rei who had, so far, stayed out of the entire confrontation.  
当然，这并不完全按照计划进行。在与葛城美里打交道时，变得更坚强和坚定并不是一件容易的事。她看向丽，到目前为止，丽一直置身于这场冲突之外。

"Look Misato, I know what you're thinking but I know what I'm doing. I will be fine."  
“听着，美里，我知道你在想什么，但我知道自己在做什么。我会没事的。”

"You can't just go in there Asuka, its suicide. I want Shinji back just as much as you do but-"  
"你不能就这样进去，明日香，那是自杀行为。我也和你一样想找回真嗣，但是——"

Asuka quickly cut her off, "I'm not doing this to get Shinji back Misato, I'm doing this to find out what they're hiding from us. I'm sick of being made a fool of by SEELE and if I can uncover or find something there it will aid me in taking them down."  
明日香迅速打断她，"我不是为了找回真嗣才这么做的，美里。我是要查明他们在对我们隐瞒什么。我受够了被 SEELE 耍得团团转，如果我能从那里发现什么，那将有助于我扳倒他们。"

"What do you mean 'you taking them down'? You can't be thinking of taking on SEELE by yourself."  
"你说的'你扳倒他们'是什么意思？你不会是想单枪匹马对付 SEELE 吧。"

"Why wouldn't I Misato? Look around you. I can't get you involved because of your pregnancy. Ayanami, no offence, but this isn't your battle and besides which you're the only one of us left if something does happen to me."  
"我怎么会不让你参与呢，美里？看看你周围。我不能让你卷进来，因为你怀孕了。绫波，无意冒犯，但这不是你的战斗，而且万一我出了什么事，你就是我们中唯一剩下的了。"

Rei looked over curiously. She had stayed out of the argument between Asuka and Katsuragi so far, thinking it much better to just get on with her work or to at least pretend to. "What do you mean by I'm the only one left?"  
绫波好奇地看了过来。她一直避免介入明日香和葛城之间的争执，认为最好还是专注于自己的工作，或者至少假装如此。“你说的‘唯一剩下的人’是什么意思？”

"Are you stupid or something? You'll be the only one with the Evangelion serum inside you left if something happens. You can't come because if we're both captured then there will be no one left to stop the Angels or SEELE."  
“你是傻还是怎么的？如果出了什么事，你将是唯一一个体内有 EVA 血清的人。你不能来，因为如果我们都被俘虏了，就没有人能阻止使徒或 SEELE 了。”

As soon as the words left her mouth she realized she might have been a bit harsh on Ayanami, but she knew it was for the best. She didn't want to get Katsuragi or Ayanami involved now. This was her battle and no one else's. It was about her, Asuka Langley Sohryu, trying to prove herself.  
话一出口，她便意识到对绫波可能有些过于严厉了，但她知道这是为了大家好。她不想让葛城或绫波卷入其中。这是她的战斗，与其他人无关。这是关于她，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，试图证明自己的战斗。

Misato sighed, realizing she wasn't going to talk Asuka out of it, "Fine then, but on one condition. I'm coming with you…"  
美里叹了口气，意识到无法说服明日香，"好吧，但有一个条件。我跟你一起去……"

Asuka opened her mouth to retort but was cut off almost immediately, "…I'm still your immediate superior in NERV, don't you forget that. You might not want to go there to find Shinji but I do. I'm not a part of the Evangelion Project either so you can't use that excuse."  
明日香刚要反驳，却被立即打断，"……我仍然是 NERV 中你的直接上级，别忘了这一点。你可能不是为了找真嗣而去那里，但我确实要去。我也不属于 EVA 计划的一部分，所以你不能用那个借口。"

Asuka glared at her superior, she knew she had lost this round but still wasn't ready to give up, "Fine but you're not breaking into the complex with me, you're staying out in the car connected to me by a headset. I'm not risking your baby for this, this is something I want to do."  
明日香瞪着她的上司，她知道自己这一局输了，但仍不打算放弃，“好吧，但你别想跟我一起闯进那个地方，你得留在车里，通过耳机跟我联系。我可不想为了这事让你冒险，这是我自己的选择。”

"That's fine with me, there is another condition though."  
“这对我没问题，不过还有个条件。”

"What is this condition?"  
“什么条件？”

"Seeing as Ayanami is meant to be protecting me I want her nearby, just in case something does go wrong."  
"既然绫波是要保护我的，我希望她能在我附近，以防万一出什么问题。"

"What? I already said abo-" Asuka exclaimed but was interrupted almost immediately.  
"什么？我已经说过了——" 明日香刚开口就被打断了。

"She won't be joining you on infiltrating the base, but I want her nearby. If anything does happen to you she can probably get you out quickly. Do you understand?"  
"她不会和你一起潜入基地，但我希望她能在附近。如果真有什么事发生，她或许能迅速带你离开。明白了吗？"

Asuka sighed, trying very hard not to lose her temper. Hadn't she just told them both why she wanted to do this alone? Shouldn't that have been enough? She replied back, "I don't have a choice, do I?"  
明日香叹了口气，极力克制着不发脾气。她不是刚刚才告诉他们俩为什么她想一个人做这件事吗？难道这还不够吗？她回道：“我没有选择，不是吗？”

Misato grinned and nodded, "You're learning pretty quickly how I do things around here."  
美里咧嘴一笑，点了点头，“你学得挺快的，已经知道我在这里的行事风格了。”

**SEELE Crash Site – 1230 hours  
SEELE 坠毁现场 – 1230 时**

Asuka slowed the car down and looked around the area. She could have sworn this was the same place. In fact, she was certain it was the same area. Even if it wasn't, she should have been able to see something. She brought the car to a halt and clutched the steering wheel tightly. She whispered to herself, "Damn it, beaten again, this isn't fair…"  
明日香放缓了车速，环顾四周。她敢肯定这就是同一个地方。事实上，她确信这就是那个区域。即便不是，她也应该能看到些什么。她将车停下，紧紧握住方向盘。她低声自语：“该死，又输了，这不公平……”

Misato looked around curiously, unsure of why Asuka had stopped the car. She was under the impression that there would be something here. All she could see was an empty area. No traces of anything anywhere. She turned to Asuka and questioned her, "Asuka why have we stopped here? I thought we were going to..."  
美里好奇地四处张望，不明白明日香为何停车。她以为这里会有什么东西。她看到的只是一片空地。任何地方都没有痕迹。她转向明日香，问道：“明日香，我们为什么停在这里？我以为我们要去……”

Asuka replied, her voice raised, "This is it, this is where it was but it's gone. "  
明日香提高了声音回答：“就是这里，就是它所在的地方，但它不见了。”

"Gone? What do you mean gone? Maybe you made a mistake."  
“不见了？什么意思？也许是你搞错了。”

Asuka quickly snapped back. "I didn't make a mistake Katsuragi, this is it! This is where it was, this was done on purpose. They're fucking with us, they wanted us to find it and then come back when it was gone."  
“我没搞错，葛城，就是这里！这是故意的！他们在耍我们，他们想让我们找到然后回来时发现它不见了。”明日香迅速反驳道。

Misato reached out a hand to try to console Asuka, but Asuka merely swiped it away and faced towards the window. She could see Asuka shaking slightly with anger, she sat silent for a moment not really sure what to say to her. She never really thought about just how hard this must be for Asuka, everything was falling apart for her. First Shinji had gone, she had nearly been killed, then the incident with Marduk and now this.  
美里伸出手试图安慰明日香，但明日香只是挥手拒绝，转向窗户。她能看到明日香因愤怒而微微颤抖，她沉默了一会儿，不知道该对她说些什么。她从未真正考虑过这对明日香来说有多艰难，一切都分崩离析。先是真嗣离开，她差点丧命，然后是马杜克事件，现在又是这个。

"Asuka look, this isn't your fault. We know how SEELE operates, we should have expected this. They've always been one step ahead, but we'll catch them."  
“明日香，看，这不是你的错。我们知道 SEELE 的行事方式，本该预料到这一点的。他们总是领先一步，但我们一定会追上他们。”

Asuka quickly wiped her eyes, just to ensure Misato wouldn't see the tears that had formed. So much for what she had told herself this morning, so much for going back to not showing emotion. She thought about what Misato had said though, it did make sense, she shouldn't get worked up over it. When she and Ayanami were there previously, they were probably spotted, so SEELE would have wanted to complete whatever it wanted to do pretty quickly and move on before they came back. It was just unfortunate timing, that was all.  
明日香迅速擦干眼睛，确保美里看不到已经形成的泪水。她今早对自己说的话都白费了，回到不表露情感的状态也泡汤了。不过，她思考了美里的话，确实有道理，她不应该为此过于激动。她和绫波之前在那里时，很可能已经被发现，所以 SEELE 会想尽快完成他们想做的事，并在她们回来之前离开。只是不巧的时机罢了，仅此而已。

Asuka smiled and turned around from looking through the window to face Misato again, "You're right, they were probably expecting us to return and have probably moved on. We should have known they would do this. We were just a little slow that's all."  
明日香微笑着从窗前转身，再次面对美里，“你说得对，他们可能预料到我们会回来，并且可能已经转移了。我们应该知道他们会这么做。我们只是稍微慢了一点，仅此而已。”

Misato nodded, "Right, so what's our next move?"  
美里点头道：“对，那我们下一步怎么办？”

Asuka thought about it for a moment and then the idea hit her. She replied back, uttering only one word, "Marduk."  
明日香思索片刻，突然灵光一闪。她只回了一个词：“玛杜克。”

Misato looked around taking a while to respond, she was slightly confused as to just what Asuka meant, "Marduk? I thought that case had been closed and was a mistake. I didn't think we would be investigating it further."  
美里环顾四周，过了一会儿才回应，她有些困惑明日香的意思，“玛杜克？我以为那案子已经结了，是个误会。没想到我们还要继续调查。”

"No, that was only because I hadn't made the connection yet. During the press conference where Nagisa miraculously reappeared, Kaji was there with me. He informed me that SEELE was funding Marduk. The two companies are connected somehow and I believe that we'll find something if we investigate them."  
"不，那只是因为我当时还没意识到这一点。在渚薰奇迹般重新出现的记者会上，加持和我在一起。他告诉我 SEELE 正在资助马尔杜克。这两家公司之间有某种联系，我相信如果我们调查他们，一定能找到些什么。"

"You're talking about taking on a huge global organization here, Asuka."  
"你这是在谈论挑战一个庞大的全球组织，明日香。"

Asuka smiled arrogantly, "I know, but if we're going to save the world we need to take big risks. That's why you won't be accompanying me on the field when I investigate. I want you to stay at NERV."  
明日香傲慢地笑了笑，"我知道，但如果我们要拯救世界，就必须承担巨大的风险。这就是为什么你不会陪我到现场调查。我希望你留在 NERV。"

"Asuka, I-" "明日香，我——"

Asuka quickly cut her off, "Before you start, I know you don't want me doing this alone. Don't worry I'm not that stupid." Asuka picked up the radio receiver in the car, "Wondergirl, you still there?"  
明日香迅速打断她，"在你开口之前，我知道你不想让我一个人做这件事。别担心，我没那么蠢。" 明日香拿起车里的无线电接收器，"真希波，你还在吗？"

There was no response from the other side. Asuka pressed the radio receiver again, "Ayanami that means you, are you still there?"  
那边没有回应。明日香再次按下无线电接收器，"绫波，那就是你，还在吗？"

"_Yes."_ "是的。"

"Good. Listen, how do you feel about investigating Marduk? What can you tell me about them?"  
"很好。听着，你对调查马尔杜克有什么看法？关于他们，你能告诉我些什么？"

"_Aside from what you already know not much else. I was aware that Keel was involved with them some how but it was unimportant to Director Ikari."_  
"除了你已经知道的，其他就不多了。我知道基尔和他们有某种联系，但对碇司令来说并不重要。"

"Okay, we will gather up what we know for now and then plan our move from there."  
"好的，我们先汇总目前已知的信息，然后再从那里制定行动计划。"

"_Okay, there is one thing Sohryu…"_  
"好吧，有一件事要告诉相龙……"

"Go ahead." "说吧。"

"_This area is unsafe. Someone is nearby, but I do not know where. We should leave now."_  
"这个地方不安全。附近有人，但我不知道在哪里。我们应该现在就离开。"

Asuka looked around the area. She couldn't see anyone either, but she too got the sense that she was being watched. She began to move the car when she felt immense pain in her head, almost as if it was being torn open. She screamed out and brought her hand up to her head. Misato acted quickly, withdrawing her gun and also looking around. She couldn't see anyone so she turned her attention to Asuka, who seemed to be a bit better but had gone slightly pale.  
明日香环顾四周。她也看不到任何人，但同样感觉到有人在监视。当她开始移动汽车时，头部突然传来剧烈的疼痛，仿佛要被撕裂一般。她尖叫着用手捂住头。美里迅速反应，拔出手枪并四处张望。她看不到任何人，于是转向明日香，后者似乎有所好转，但脸色略显苍白。

"Asuka, are you alright?"  
“明日香，你还好吗？”

Asuka nodded, "Yeah…I'm fine just…I haven't been getting much sleep so I've been getting headaches. It's nothing."  
明日香点点头，“嗯……我没事，只是……最近睡眠不足，有点头疼。没什么大不了的。”

_3__rd_ _October 2015_ 2015 年 10 月 3 日

**NERV Offices – 1400 hours  
NERV 办公室 —— 14:00**

Asuka looked down at the stack of paper in front of her and groaned. Although she supposed she only had herself to blame for it. After all, she had been the one to suggest they take the full brunt of the investigation into Marduk. The reports came from a variety of sources that both she and Katsuragi had been able to collect over the past few nights.  
明日香低头看着面前的一堆文件，叹了口气。虽然她觉得这只能怪自己。毕竟，是她提议他们承担起对马尔杜克调查的全部压力。这些报告来自她和葛城在过去几个晚上收集的各种来源。

This of course meant that Asuka had once again missed out on another few nights of sleep. Although sleeping wasn't exactly something she wanted to do right now. She had, however, been able to sneak a quick nap in Katsuragi's office while both Misato and Ayanami were there. Luckily there had been no nightmares. She didn't want to admit it, but the knowledge that both Katsuragi and Ayanami were near was probably to thank for that.  
当然，这意味着明日香又一次错过了几个晚上的睡眠。虽然现在睡觉并不是她特别想做的事情。不过，她还是在葛城办公室里趁美里和绫波都在的时候偷偷打了个盹。幸运的是，没有做噩梦。她不想承认，但知道葛城和绫波在附近，可能是避免噩梦的原因。

She only wished it would have lasted a bit longer, but she was awoken by the force of Misato hitting her with several folders she had collected from Kaji and his investigation into Marduk. Ayanami hadn't found anything yet, but that was because Asuka had asked her to deal with Director Ikari and find out what she could from him. Asuka smiled slightly when she thought of the trouble Ayanami must be having right now. Although she didn't know Director Ikari that well, from the way he treat Shinji and the way he acted before she assumed he probably wasn't an easy person to deal with.  
她只希望这宁静能再持续一会儿，但被美里用从加持和他对马尔杜克的调查中收集的几份文件猛击而醒。绫波还没找到任何线索，但这都是因为明日香让她去对付碇指挥官，从他那里探出点什么。想到绫波此刻可能遇到的麻烦，明日香微微一笑。虽然她对碇指挥官了解不深，但从他对真嗣的态度和之前的举止来看，她猜想他大概不是个容易对付的人。

'_Okay, so maybe it was a bit immature, but it's a slight bit of revenge for what we've been through. Besides, if anyone can deal with that guy it's probably her.'_  
'好吧，也许这有点幼稚，但这是对我们所经历的一切的一点小小报复。再说了，如果有人能对付那家伙，那大概就是她了。'

Asuka was actually surprised Ikari hadn't immediately halted the investigation. She would have continued it regardless, but if Ikari didn't want them to investigate and find his own son she didn't think there would have been a chance in hell of letting them investigate a big company like this.  
明日香其实对碇没有立即叫停调查感到惊讶。她无论如何都会继续调查，但如果碇不想让他们调查并找到他自己的儿子，她不认为他们会有机会调查这样一个大公司。

Asuka looked at the various files on the desk and moved to one side, the ones donated by Kaji. That was another surprise to her, that Kaji was willing to hand over the information like he had. Of course she knew he was a good person, he being her guardian all those years ago proved that, but she knew he was a person who liked to keep his secrets close to himself. Maybe he was just as desperate as the rest of them were to stop SEELE.  
明日香看着桌上的各种文件，移步到一侧，那是加持捐赠的部分。这让她颇为意外，加持愿意如此坦诚地交出信息。当然，她知道他是个好人，多年前他作为她的监护人就证明了这一点，但她明白他是个喜欢将秘密深藏心底的人。或许他和他们一样，迫切希望阻止 SEELE。

'_Of course this probably isn't everything he had on them, but it's still something.'_  
'当然，这可能不是他掌握的全部信息，但总归是个开始。'

She turned her attention to the other files she had found, mostly reports from various sites on the Internet and previous un-investigated cases. There was a whole collection of theories on Marduk itself, some of them downright idiotic and bizarre whilst some actually made sense. Asuka wondered if some of the people who wrote them perhaps knew more than they let on.  
她转而关注起其他找到的文件，主要是来自互联网各处的报告和以往未被调查的案件。关于 Marduk 本身，有一整套理论，其中一些荒谬至极，而另一些则颇有道理。明日香不禁猜想，撰写这些理论的人或许知道的比他们透露的要多。

'_Head of Marduk is actually an alien appointed to run the organization to prepare for an invasion by an Alien Empire. This alien is not alone however, there are many more appointed throughout the worlds governments and have key positions of power in the U.N. and in organizations throughout the world. Most of the world's key technological advances have been in part thanks to acquired alien technology._  
马杜克首领实际上是一名被指派来管理组织，为外星帝国入侵做准备的外星人。然而，这名外星人并非孤身一人，世界各地政府中还有许多其他被任命的外星人，他们在联合国和全球各组织中占据关键权力职位。世界上的大多数关键科技进步，部分归功于获取的外星技术。

_The aliens will attack by sending alien slaves through inter-dimensional gateways to weaken the human population. These gateways will be opened once a teleportation experiment, which has been rigged to fail, begins. First we will be flooded by the Alien Wildlife weakening off most of the complex housing the experiment then they will send in the Alien Slaves.  
外星人将通过跨维度传送门派遣外星奴隶来削弱人类人口。这些传送门将在一次被设计为失败的传送实验开始时打开。首先，我们将被外星野生动物淹没，削弱进行实验的复杂建筑，随后他们将派遣外星奴隶。_

_They will then appear in force and take over Earth. This process has been planned to take only a matter of hours. When they appear the U.N. will simply hand over Earth….'  
然后，他们将以压倒性力量出现并接管地球。这一过程计划在几小时内完成。当他们出现时，联合国将简单地交出地球……_

Asuka smiled as she read the theory, wondering if the guy who wrote it had ever considered becoming a writer for video games or movies. She was almost believing it right up until it mentioned teleportation experiments. She already knew that was not how it would happen. It would be brute force from these invaders.  
明日香一边读着这个理论，一边微笑着，心想写这理论的家伙是否考虑过成为电子游戏或电影的编剧。她几乎要相信了，直到文中提到传送实验。她已经知道那不是事情的真相。这些入侵者将会用蛮力解决问题。

She prepared to move to the next theory when, much to her annoyance, the phone in the office began to ring. She sighed and picked it up. However, before she got a chance to speak the person on the other end came though. The person seemed to be using some sort of voice distortion. _"Agent Sohryu?"_  
她正准备转向下一个理论，这时办公室里的电话突然响起，让她颇为恼火。她叹了口气，拿起电话。然而，还没等她开口，对方的声音就传了过来。那人似乎使用了某种变声器。"草薙特工？"

"Who is this?" “这是谁？”

"_A friend. You want to find Shinji Ikari, correct?"_  
"一个朋友。你想找到碇真嗣，对吧？"

"How do you know about that?"  
"你怎么知道那件事的？"

"_I'm the one asking questions here, yes or no?"_  
"这里该我问问题，对还是不对？"

"Yes, who are you?" "对，你是谁？"

"_Meet me at the Marduk Institute headquarters at twenty three hundred hours four days from now. Understand?"_  
"四天后晚上十一点，在马杜克研究所总部见我。明白吗？"

"Wait how do you...?" "等等，你怎么...？"

Asuka cursed as the phone line went dead. She looked down at the number she had written while the person was on the phone. Whoever that person was, they didn't seem to go to great lengths to hide their identity. Using this, she could trace the owner and user of that phone. There was of course the problem of finding someone to do that task. There was no one within NERV she could really trust with it.  
电话线路一断，明日香便咒骂起来。她低头看着通话时记下的号码。无论对方是谁，他们似乎并不费心隐藏身份。利用这个，她可以追踪到那部电话的主人和使用者。当然，问题在于找到一个可以信赖的人来完成这项任务。在 NERV 内部，她找不到真正可以信任的人来做这件事。

She thought for a moment and smiled when she thought of the one person who might be able to help her.  
她思索片刻，想到那个或许能帮上忙的人，不禁微笑起来。

**Kensuke's Residence – 1730 hours  
健介的住所 —— 17 时 30 分**

Asuka pulled up outside the apartment block. It had been quite some time since she was last here. Probably around the time of Touji's death. Just looking at the apartment block sent a chill down her spine. Slowly, she got out of the car and headed towards the door. There was a brief moment of hesitation before she knocked, but she decided to get it over and done with. She knocked on the door and waited a moment. After receiving no response she knocked again only to hear someone behind her.  
明日香在公寓楼外停下车。她已经很久没来过这里了，大概是在东治去世的时候。光是看着这栋公寓楼，就让她脊背发凉。她缓缓下车，走向门口。在敲门前，她犹豫了一瞬，但还是决定速战速决。她敲了敲门，等待片刻。没有回应，她又敲了一次，却听到身后有人声。

"Agent Sohryu?" "索留龙小姐？"

She turned and found Kensuke stepping out of a car and heading towards the door. He stepped up and unlocked the door.  
她转身发现健介从一辆车里出来，朝门口走去。他走上前，打开了门锁。

"What are you doing here? It's unsafe."  
"你在这里做什么？这里不安全。"

"What do you mean?" "你这是什么意思？"

"I can't explain here, get inside."  
"这里解释不清，先进来。"

He opened the door and stepped in, she quickly followed him. His appearance surprised her somewhat. He was wearing a full suit and looked much less like the stereotypical geek he did a few months ago, but now slightly more like a normal person. She turned to face him, a surprised look on her face. He smiled slightly.  
他打开门走了进去，她迅速跟在他后面。他的外表让她有些惊讶。他穿着一身正装，看起来比几个月前那个典型的书呆子形象要正常多了，但现在更像一个普通人。她转过身面对他，脸上带着惊讶的表情。他微微一笑。

"I know what you're thinking. This is why it's unsafe around here, shortly after Touji's accident..."  
"我知道你在想什么。这就是为什么这里不安全，在东治出事之后不久……"

He paused for a moment. The subject of the accident was still a tough one for him. It was for anyone.  
他顿了顿。那场事故的话题对他来说依然沉重。对任何人都是如此。

"Shortly after the incident a person from the Marduk Institute approached me. They offered me a job there. At first I was hesitant, but then I heard a bit more about it. They wanted me to work on the network administration and security systems in there, something I'm a bit of an expert at and besides, the pay was really good."  
“事故发生后不久，马尔杜克研究所的人就找上了我。他们给我提供了一份工作。起初我有些犹豫，但随后他们透露了更多细节。他们希望我负责那里的网络管理和安全系统，这方面我算是专家，而且，报酬确实很丰厚。”

"So you took the job?"  
“所以你接受了这份工作？”

"Correct. At first I didn't really think about it, and then I saw you and Shinji on the security cameras one day. I knew it wasn't a day trip, so I did a bit of digging and found out the reasons why you were there. Nagisa, the head of Marduk had gone missing."  
"没错。起初我并没有多想，直到有一天在监控摄像头里看到你和真嗣。我知道那不是一次短途旅行，于是我稍微调查了一下，发现了你们在那里的原因。玛杜克机构的负责人长良，失踪了。"

"Except for the fact that…"  
"除了那个事实……"

"He wasn't really missing, I saw the press conference and I saw them denying NERV ever being there. So I did a bit more digging. I found a few interesting things around there, bugs and cameras. Whoever installed them is a bit of an amateur, but the technology goes back to the Marduk Institute. "  
"其实他并没有真正失踪，我看了新闻发布会，也看到他们否认 NERV 曾在那里存在过。于是我又深入调查了一番。我在那附近发现了一些有趣的东西，比如窃听器和摄像头。安装这些东西的人技术水平一般，但这些设备的技术源头可以追溯到玛杜克研究所。"

Asuka looked on, surprised she hadn't expected this when she arrived. But now the whole Marduk mystery was widening up. She didn't say anything but allowed Kensuke to continue.  
明日香环顾四周，惊讶于自己来时并未预料到这一幕。但现在，整个马杜克谜团正逐渐展开。她没有说话，只是让真希波继续。

"So I thought of something, whoever hired me knew about Touji and they knew about you and Shinji. They were expecting you to come here and that's why they bugged the area, what I don't understand is why."  
“所以我想到，雇我的人不仅知道我和你、真嗣的关系，还知道你和真嗣。他们预料到你会来这里，这就是为什么他们在这个区域安装了窃听器，我不明白的是为什么。”

"That's what I'm trying to find out."  
“那正是我试图查明的。”

"So you are here about Marduk."  
"看来你是为了马尔杜克而来的。"

"Sort of, is this room bugged?"  
"算是吧，这房间被监听了吗？"

"Don't worry, I was able to knock all of them out. Like I said, whoever set them up was an amateur. They had an awful range and were barely even able to pick up anything anyway."  
"别担心，我已经把它们全搞定了。就像我说的，设置这些监听器的人是个外行。它们的范围很差，几乎什么都捕捉不到。"

"Okay, so we're safe now."  
"好了，我们现在安全了。"

He nodded, "Right, now we are."  
他点头，"对，现在我们安全了。"

"Okay, good. We were able to link SEELE to Marduk, so we're trying to find out what we can on Marduk. We think the reason they had us investigate Nagisa's disappearance was simply to get a hold of Shinji."  
"很好。我们已经成功将 SEELE 与马尔杜克会联系起来，正在设法了解马尔杜克会的信息。我们认为他们让我们调查渚薰的失踪，只是为了控制真嗣。"

"Makes sense." "有道理。"

"So earlier today I was sitting in my office, when I get a phone call from someone. This person was, as you would say an 'amateur', they didn't even hide their phone number. I can't really trust anyone inside NERV right now and I need a trace ran on the number."  
"今天早些时候，我坐在办公室里，突然接到一个电话。对方嘛，用你的话说就是个‘业余’，连电话号码都没隐藏。现在我实在不敢相信 NERV 内部的任何人，我需要你帮忙追踪一下这个号码。"

"I can handle that, what exactly is it you need?"  
"这事儿我能搞定，你具体需要我做什么？"

"The owner and where they called from."  
"店主以及他们来电的地点。"

Kensuke nodded and took the sheet of paper Asuka was holding from her. He quickly made his way over to his computer and began the process. A few minutes later he turned around to Asuka and spoke again.  
健介点点头，从明日香手中接过那张纸。他迅速走向自己的电脑，开始操作。几分钟后，他转过身来对明日香说道。

"This might take a while, that alright with you?"  
"这可能需要一些时间，你介意吗？"

Asuka nodded and waited for him to continue. He turned back around to the computer and entered the number she had given him. It was a quick and easy process, or at least that's what it seemed like. Within a matter of seconds he was reporting the details.  
明日香点点头，等待他继续。他转回电脑前，输入了她给的号码。这个过程快速而简单，或者至少看起来是这样。几秒钟之内，他就开始报告细节了。

"Right, that took a shorter time than I thought. Unfortunately, there is a problem."  
“好吧，这比我想象的要快。不幸的是，有个问题。”

Asuka sighed, there was always a problem these days it seemed, "Go ahead."  
明日香叹了口气，最近似乎总有麻烦，“说吧。”

"Well I was able to get the location, but not the owner. Whoever it is probably knew we'd try this so already took steps to prevent it."  
"好吧，我确实找到了地点，但没查到主人。对方可能预料到我们会这么做，所以已经采取了防范措施。"

"Okay, so what was the location?"  
"那么，地点是哪里？"

Kensuke replied almost immediately, "It was from within NERV. Whoever was using that cell phone was calling you from the NERV Headquarters. Could have been another agent."  
健介几乎立刻回答道：“是从 NERV 内部打来的。使用那个手机的人是从 NERV 总部给你打的电话。可能是其他特工。”

Asuka smiled, it was just as she expected, this was exactly why she couldn't get this done inside NERV. "Right, that's all I needed to know, thank you Kensuke."  
明日香笑了，正如她所料，这正是她无法在 NERV 内部完成这件事的原因。“好，这就是我需要知道的，谢谢你，健介。”

He nodded, "Not a problem, I won't pry into the details because I know you're not going to tell me but whatever it is you're doing, be careful."  
他点头道：“没问题，我不会追问细节，因为我知道你不会告诉我，但无论你在做什么，请小心。”

"You don't need to worry about me."  
“你不必为我担心。”

Kensuke nodded and watched as she turned and exited the apartment. Almost immediately after she closed the door his own cell phone began to ring. He answered and spoke into it.  
健介点点头，看着她转身离开了公寓。她刚关上门，他的手机几乎立刻就响了起来。他接起电话，对着话筒说道。

"Yes, she just left. As expected there were no problems."  
“是的，她刚走。不出所料，一切顺利。”

He paused to allow the other person time to speak.  
他停顿了一下，让对方有时间说话。

"She doesn't suspect a thing, all she knows is where the phone call was made. She trusts us anyway."  
"她什么都没怀疑，只知道电话是从哪里打来的。无论如何，她还是信任我们的。"

He paused again before questioning the other person.  
他再次停顿，然后向对方提问。

"You ensure this will help her and Shinji though?"  
"你能确保这会帮助她和真嗣吗？"

"_..."_

"Good." “好。”

_7__th_ _October 2015_ 2015 年 10 月 7 日

**Marduk Institute – 2300 hours  
马杜克研究所 – 2300 时**

Asuka stepped out into the darkened alleyway. This had to have been the place the person who contacted her meant. It was right next to the main building, yet just hidden well enough to not be spotted. She leaned against the wall and brushed her hair back. She looked around towards the front of the building and squinted slightly, trying to see if anyone was approaching. The pounding rain running down her face and down the street obscured her vision somewhat.  
明日香踏入昏暗的小巷。这一定是与她联系的那个人所指的地方。它紧邻主楼，却又巧妙地隐藏起来，不易被发现。她靠在墙上，捋了捋头发。她环顾四周，试图看清是否有人正朝这边走来。雨水重重地打在她的脸上，顺着街道流淌，使她的视线有些模糊。

She silently wished that whoever had contacted her would hurry up and make their presence known now. She didn't anticipate the weather being this bad and if they were indeed going to be infiltrating Marduk she didn't need to be dragged down by her clothes being soaked through.  
她默默祈祷，希望那个联系她的人能快点现身。她没料到天气会这么糟糕，如果他们真的要潜入马尔杜克，她可不想因为衣服湿透而拖后腿。

She took another quick look round and just as she finished, her cell phone began to vibrate quietly in her pocket. She cursed silently and took it out, looking at the caller I.D. Much to her surprise it was the same number that had contacted her. She pressed to answer it and spoke quietly into the phone.  
她又迅速环顾四周，就在她刚看完的时候，口袋里的手机开始轻轻震动。她暗自咒骂，掏出手机，看着来电显示。令她惊讶的是，又是同一个号码联系她。她按下接听键，轻声对着电话说。

"Okay, I'm here. What now?"  
“好了，我到了。接下来呢？”

"_At the end of the street there is a parked limousine with the engine and lights turned off. The doors, however, are open. Walk to the end of the street and get into it."_  
街尾停着一辆引擎熄火、灯光关闭的豪华轿车，车门却是敞开的。走到街尽头，然后上车。

Almost immediately after the voice finished speaking the phone line went dead. Asuka stepped out of the alleyway, conscious that what she was about to do could be the biggest mistake she had ever made in her life. She kept on telling herself that it was a stupid idea, that even she shouldn't be taking a risk like this. For all she knew, someone from SEELE could be here, ready for her. She could be walking into a huge trap, yet something pushed her on. A subconscious desire to find out the truth, to get some pride back and to get back that which was dear to her.  
话音刚落，电话就断了。明日香走出巷子，意识到自己即将要做的事可能是她一生中最大的错误。她不断告诉自己这是个愚蠢的主意，连她都不应该冒这样的险。她所知的一切，可能就是 SEELE 的某个人就在这里，等着她。她可能正步入一个巨大的陷阱，但某种力量推动着她前进。一种潜意识里的渴望，想要揭开真相，找回自尊，夺回那些对她来说珍贵的东西。

She turned back onto the street and pulled her jacket hood up again to try to shield her from the rain. She got to the end of the street, there it was just like the person had said, a parked black limousine. Nothing too unusual for this end of the city. Limousines were often spotted going back and forth due to it being the major business sector. This was where those who had money, power or both in Tokyo 3 came. A fitting area for one of the world's biggest organizations.  
她转身回到街道上，再次拉起夹克的帽子，试图遮挡雨水。她走到街道尽头，那里果然如那人所说，停着一辆黑色豪华轿车。对于这个城市的这一带来说，并不算太稀奇。由于这里是主要的商业区，豪华轿车经常来回穿梭。东京 3 区正是那些有钱、有权或两者兼备的人聚集的地方。这里也适合世界最大组织之一的所在地。

As she approached the limousine, the door opened slightly. She paused, expecting someone to step out. When no one did she cautiously approached it. As she stopped to look inside she heard the same voice she had heard on the phone just minutes ago.  
当她走近豪华轿车时，车门微微打开。她停下脚步，以为会有人走出来。但当没有人出现时，她小心翼翼地靠近。她停下来看向车内，听到了几分钟前在电话里听到的同一个声音。

"Agent Sohryu, get inside quickly. Our time is limited."  
“碇小姐，快点进来。我们的时间有限。”

She removed her hood and got inside the darkened limousine, closing the door behind her. She was only in darkness for a matter of moments before the main light came on and she found herself sitting only a meter or two away from Gendo Ikari. She looked on, trying to hide her shock and anger at the man. Sitting next to him was Ayanami, she was wearing a dark black bodysuit and had a bag next to her.  
她脱下兜帽，钻进那辆昏暗的豪华轿车，关上了身后的车门。在黑暗中仅停留了片刻，主灯便亮了起来，她发现自己与碇源堂仅隔一两米的距离。她努力掩饰着内心的震惊与愤怒，注视着这个男人。坐在他旁边的是绫波零，她身着深黑色紧身衣，身旁放着一个包。

"What...What is this?" “这……这是什么？”

Gendo smiled arrogantly and answered her question, "This is where it all begins to end Sohryu. I must apologize for leading you on like this, I would have preferred to call you into my office in NERV and explain this there. However, SEELE has now infiltrated NERV and have appointed several agents. Luckily, we were able to send in someone of our own. Someone they would never suspect..."  
碇源堂傲慢地笑了笑，回答她的问题：“这就是一切开始终结的地方，惣流。我必须为这样引导你道歉，我本希望能在 NERV 的办公室里叫你来解释这一切。然而，SEELE 已经渗透了 NERV，并安插了多名特工。幸运的是，我们能够安插我们自己的人进去。一个他们绝不会怀疑的人……”

Asuka didn't care what the man had to say, right now her previous thought that this was a mistake had just been confirmed in her head. All she wanted to do now was go home, get changed and go to bed. "Why have you called me here?"  
明日香并不在乎这个男人要说什么，此刻她心中先前认为这是个错误的念头已经得到了证实。她现在只想回家，换身衣服然后上床睡觉。“你为什么叫我来这里？”

"As you might have already found out, I am not working with SEELE. In fact, much the contrary, I want to stop them from completing their scenario. I was able to construct my own plan to achieve this, as you might have guessed it involved using you, Shinji and Rei as the recipients of the Evangelion Serum. However, due to unforeseen circumstances I have had to alter that."  
“如你所知，我并未与 SEELE 合作。实际上，恰恰相反，我想阻止他们完成他们的计划。我构思了自己的方案来达成这一目标，你可能已经猜到，这涉及到利用你、真嗣和丽作为 EVA 血清的接受者。然而，由于一些意外情况，我不得不对此进行调整。”

"So what, now that we know who you are you're just going to ask us instead of manipulating us, is that it?"  
“那么，现在我们知道你是谁了，你就不再操纵我们，而是直接请求我们，是这样吗？”

"In a sense. A few days ago Rei came to me asking about Marduk and SEELE's relationship. She told me that you were investigating them because of recent events and because of information passed down by Ryoji Kaji."  
"从某种意义上说。前几天，丽来找我问关于马杜克和 SEELE 的关系。她告诉我，你因为最近的事件和加持良治传下来的信息在调查他们。"

Asuka nodded, "That is correct."  
明日香点头，"没错。"

"We received more information from Kaji yesterday that Marduk's miracle vaccine may not be as it seems. I want you and Rei to get into the facility. I have provided appropriate weaponry and equipment to get you inside. There are laboratories on the lower levels, I want you to gather what you can from them."  
"昨天我们从加持那里得到了更多信息，马杜克的奇迹疫苗可能并不像表面上那样。我希望你和丽潜入那个设施。我已经为你们准备了合适的武器和装备以便进入。下面几层有实验室，我要你们尽可能从那里收集信息。"

Asuka didn't know what to think, was Gendo being serious, was he really going to aid them or was this just another false truth? "Why do you want us to do this, why the sudden rush?"  
明日香不知道该如何思考，碇司令是认真的吗，他真的会帮助他们，还是这只是另一个虚假的真相？“你为什么想让我们这么做，为什么突然这么急？”

"SEELE is getting desperate. They are trying to advance their schedule and bring a colonization ship here earlier than expected, regardless of whether or not the Angels are defeated. I also believe that the key to finding my son is within those labs."  
“SEELE 已经变得绝望。他们试图提前推进计划，将殖民船提前带到此地，无论是否击败了使徒。我也相信，找到我儿子的关键就在那些实验室里。”

Asuka looked him in the eyes, still unsure of if he was being serious with this. It all seemed so sudden, this person who had stayed hidden all that time. Had only operated in secrecy was now willing to help her infiltrate this organization. There had to be something more, another motive perhaps, it just seemed a bit too sudden.  
明日香直视着他的眼睛，仍然不确定他是否对此事认真。这一切似乎都太突然了，这个一直隐藏在暗处的人，只在秘密中行动，现在却愿意帮助她渗透这个组织。肯定还有别的东西，或许是另一个动机，这一切似乎来得太突然了。

"What about SEELE, they aren't exactly going to let us in through the front door?"  
"关于 SEELE，他们可不会轻易让我们从正门进去吧？"

"I know, that's why I had Kaji 'borrow' a little something of theirs. Rei, hand her one of the weapons."  
"我知道，所以我让加持‘借’了他们一点小东西。绫波，递给她一把武器。"

Rei nodded and reached into the large bag, pulling out a small handgun not too dissimilar to the standard issue NERV Handgun. She handed it to Asuka who looked at it with a look of confusion on her face. "It's a handgun? This is it?"  
绫波点点头，伸手从大包里掏出一把小型手枪，与 NERV 标准配备的手枪颇为相似。她递给明日香，后者看着手中的枪，脸上露出困惑的表情。“这是手枪？就这个？”

Gendo nodded, "Correct, it's a handgun. However, they are loaded with special issue ammo. A protective measure for SEELE, something that they and Marduk have been developing for some time. The ammunition for those guns has been developed from an alien alloy found some time ago. It is the same alien alloy that flowed through Agent Carter's veins. It has been created from what was thought to be a weapon. Keel named the 'weapon' the Lance of Longinus. This is due to its so called 'divine' property to pass directly through any A.T. Field of any strength."  
源度点头，“没错，这是手枪。不过，它们装填的是特殊弹药。这是为了 SEELE 的安全措施，他们和 Marduk 已经研发了一段时间。这些枪支的弹药是由不久前发现的异星合金制成的。正是同一种异星合金流经了卡特探员的血管。它源自被认为是武器的东西。基尔称之为‘朗基努斯之枪’。这是因为其所谓的‘神圣’属性，能够直接穿透任何强度的 A.T.力场。”

Asuka smiled slightly, this should definitely even the playing field then. "Okay, so all you want us to do is get into the facility, find what we can in the labs and get out of there. Sounds easy enough."  
明日香微微一笑，这无疑会让局面变得公平。“好吧，你们要我们做的就是潜入设施，在实验室里找到能找到的东西然后撤离。听起来挺简单的。”

Gendo nodded, "Don't get ahead of yourself, Sohryu. SEELE and Keel are clever, they will be expecting it. That's why I had Shinji's friend Kensuke assigned to a job there. He's been watching over certain sections and reporting back to me. He is also responsible for the block wide power outage that will occur in five minutes."  
源度点头，“别太自信，惣流。SEELE 和基尔很聪明，他们会预料到的。这就是为什么我把真嗣的朋友健介安排在那里工作。他一直在监视某些区域并向我汇报。他还负责将在五分钟后发生的区域性停电。”

**Laboratories – 2330 hours  
实验室 – 2330 小时**

Ayanami and Asuka continued down the corridor, moving as slowly and quietly as they could. In the distance Asuka could make out the faint red emergency lights guiding them towards their destination. So far so good she thought to herself, but it was a bit too easy. Hadn't Director Ikari told them that SEELE would be expecting something like this? Why wasn't anyone trying to stop them? Or were they all preoccupied with the power outage and searching different areas?  
绫波和明日香继续沿着走廊缓慢而安静地前进。在远处，明日香能辨认出微弱的红色应急灯光，指引着他们前往目的地。到目前为止一切顺利，她心想，但这未免也太容易了。难道碇司令没有告诉他们，SEELE 会预料到这样的行动吗？为什么没有人试图阻止他们？还是说他们都忙于应对停电，在不同区域搜索？

Nonetheless they had to press on. They were so close now, she was so close to redeeming herself. To proving that she didn't need anyone's help, to regaining some of that lost pride and to regain Shinji. They edged closer now, it was only a matter of meters away, her heart rate began to speed up as she reached out for the door handle. They both paused before opening the door, trying to listen for anything. Asuka turned to Ayanami, "You hear anything?"  
尽管如此，他们必须继续前进。现在他们已经非常接近了，她离自我救赎如此之近。为了证明她不需要任何人的帮助，为了重拾那失去的骄傲，为了重新赢得真嗣。他们逐渐靠近，只剩下几米的距离，当她伸手去抓门把手时，心跳开始加速。两人在开门前停顿了一下，试图聆听任何动静。明日香转向绫波，“你听到什么了吗？”

Rei shook her head, "Nothing, its safe."  
丽摇了摇头，“没事，这里安全。”

"Good, let's go then." “好，那我们走吧。”

She opened the door and stepped through into the laboratory. The laboratory was slightly better lit due to the higher number of emergency lights, although it was also much larger than Asuka had anticipated. In the dark red glow she could make out various chambers lined up, all of then cylindrical and placed next to each other, set out almost like supermarket aisles. At the far end she could make out a small circular file rack and what appeared to be a hospital operating table.  
她推开门，踏入了实验室。由于应急灯数量较多，实验室内的光线比外面稍亮一些，尽管其面积比明日香预想的要大得多。在暗红色的光线下，她能看到一排排的圆柱形舱室，它们并排摆放，布局几乎像超市的货架一样。在远处，她隐约看到一个小型的圆形文件架和一张看似医院手术台的设备。

Beside her, she spotted Rei looking in one of the tanks curiously. She walked up near her, taking a look for herself. She almost dropped her gun in shock. Inside the tank was a fully grown human being, or at least that was what it looked like. A girl around seventeen years of age, her eyes shut and long hair flowing in the LCL. Asuka turned to Ayanami, barely able to say anything.  
在她旁边，她注意到丽正好奇地看着其中一个水槽。她走近了一些，自己也看了看。她几乎惊得把手中的枪都掉了。水槽里是一个完全长大的人类，或者至少看起来是这样。一个大约十七岁的女孩，双眼紧闭，长发在 LCL 中飘动。明日香转向绫波，几乎说不出话来。

"What...What is this?" “这...这是什么？”

"A cloning room, these are empty vessels waiting for a soul to take charge of them."  
“克隆室，这些是等待灵魂来掌控的空壳。”

Asuka looked on in horror, "Clones? You mean SEELE is cloning people?"  
明日香惊恐地看着，“克隆体？你是说 SEELE 在克隆人？”

"Yes." "是的。"

Rei said it so bluntly, almost as if the idea didn't even faze her. In fact, the way she was looking at the tank, it was almost as if she felt sorry for the person inside or had some sort of connection to that person. Asuka shrugged the thought away, it was just her mind playing tricks on her. It was a huge shock seeing this, it would faze anyone, Ayanami just wasn't letting it show.  
绫波说得很直白，几乎像是这个想法对她毫无影响。实际上，她看着那个罐子的眼神，就好像她对里面的人感到同情，或者与那个人有某种联系。明日香甩开这个念头，这只是她的心理作用。看到这一幕确实令人震惊，任何人都会受到影响，只是绫波没有表现出来。

They moved up the aisle of tanks, Asuka glancing in each one as they passed. The people inside varied in age from baby all the way up to early twenties, both male and female. It was like SEELE was just growing humans. The idea of it made Asuka sick to her stomach. These weren't people, they were just dolls that had a mind. It was worse than the colonization to her.  
他们沿着一排排罐子走去，明日香经过时瞥了一眼每一个罐子。里面的人年龄从婴儿到二十岁出头不等，有男有女。SEELE 就像是在培育人类。这个想法让明日香感到恶心。这些人不是真正的人，他们只是有思想的玩偶。对她来说，这比殖民还要糟糕。

What surprised her the most though was how Ayanami seemed to be so unfazed by the whole thing. As if she expected it or had seem it before. Everything here it was beyond anything Asuka had seen, she didn't scare easily but the thought that SEELE and Marduk were doing something like this terrified her. Why wouldn't it have the same effect on Rei, surely this should be just as high a priority as everything else. She continued following her until the end of the section and looked out among the small lab area.  
最让她惊讶的是，绫波似乎对这一切毫不在意，仿佛早已预料到或见过类似情景。这里的一切都超出了明日香所见过的任何事物，她并不轻易感到恐惧，但想到 SEELE 和 Marduk 正在做这样的事情，她感到无比惊恐。为什么这对绫波没有同样的影响，这应该和其他事情一样重要。她继续跟着绫波，直到这一区域的尽头，环顾着这个小实验室。

Ayanami stopped up ahead and looked around before moving towards the file rack, she withdrew one of the folders and stuffed it inside her bag. Asuka eyed her curiously questioning what she was doing, "Ayanami aren't they going to notice if we take these?"  
绫波在前方停下，环顾四周后走向文件架，抽出一个文件夹塞进自己的包里。明日香好奇地看着她，质疑道：“绫波，如果我们拿走这些，他们不会发现吗？”

"Yes, but we need some sort of proof. Besides, it won't matter much, this is not a high priority section for them."  
“是的，但我们需要一些证据。而且，这无关紧要，这不是他们的高优先级区域。”

Asuka nodded and looked at the rack herself. With a morbid curiosity she began looking at the names on it and then one of them caught her eye. She reached towards the folder, her eyes wide with shock. Sure enough her eyes weren't playing tricks on her, the folder, the scans, the reports, each one of them named, and dated.  
明日香点点头，自己也看向那排架子。带着一种病态的好奇心，她开始查看上面的名字，然后其中一个吸引了她的目光。她伸手去拿那个文件夹，眼中满是震惊。果然，她的眼睛没有欺骗她，文件夹、扫描件、报告，每一份都标有名字和日期。

_'Kasturagi, Misato' '葛城美里'_

She reached to put the folder in her jacket when she looked up. Ayanami seemed focused on something at the other end of the room. Asuka looked around quickly. Had it been a set up, no that can't be it why would she have been set up like this, what would it achieve?  
她伸手想把文件夹放进夹克里，这时她抬起头。绫波似乎正专注地看着房间另一端的东西。明日香迅速环顾四周。这是不是一个陷阱？不，不可能，为什么她会被这样设计，这样做能达成什么目的？

Ayanami whispered, "This was a trap, they were expecting us."  
绫波低语道：“这是个陷阱，他们早有准备。”

Those were the last words Asuka heard before collapsing to the floor.  
这是明日香昏倒前听到的最后一句话。

**Unknown Location 未知地点**

When she awoke she found herself lying in a different area. She slowly opened her eyes, to find the hot sun beating down upon her. How long had she been out for? Where had she been taken and why? The last thing she remembered was discovering Misato's file in that lab and then being knocked out by something. More to the point where was Ayanami? Had she been captured as well?  
当她醒来时，发现自己躺在一个陌生的地方。她缓缓睁开眼，感受到炽热的阳光直射而下。她昏迷了多久？被带到了哪里，又是为何？她最后记得的是在那间实验室发现了美里少校的文件，然后就被什么东西击昏了。更重要的是，绫波在哪里？她也被抓了吗？

She looked around the immediate area. She was in some sort of coastal area, she was outside but she herself was locked in a large cage like some sort of animal. Asuka tried to stand but was brought back to the floor again by some sort of chains keeping her held down. In front of her was a huge screen. However, there was nothing on it just yet.  
她环顾四周，发现自己身处某个沿海地带，虽然身处户外，却被囚禁在一个巨大的笼子里，仿佛一头野兽。明日香试图站起来，却被某种链条拽回了地面。在她面前是一块巨大的屏幕，但目前上面空无一物。

"Agent Asuka Langley Sohryu, it's good to see you're awake."  
“特工惣流·明日香·兰格雷，很高兴看到你醒了。”

She looked around for where the voice had come from. She watched as a woman walked into view above her and near the screen. She saw next to her a small building and could vaguely make out the form of someone else at the doorway.  
她四处寻找声音的来源。只见一名女子走进她的视线，站在屏幕附近的高处。她注意到旁边有一座小建筑，隐约能看到门口有另一个人的身影。

"Welcome to our little facility Asuka. We will overlook your little trespass into our headquarters. First of all let me explain just where you are. We're currently on an island a couple of hundred miles offshore of Japan. This is where we conduct the research on our vaccines."  
"欢迎来到我们的小设施，明日香。我们会忽略你擅自闯入我们总部的小过失。首先让我解释一下你现在所处的位置。我们目前在一个距离日本海岸几百英里的小岛上。这里是我们进行疫苗研究的地方。"

Asuka felt humiliated, it had been a trap and her and Ayanami had walked straight into it. Why couldn't she have seen it coming? And now, once again she was unable to do anything, all she could do was try to give some sort of vocal resistance, "What do you want from me?"  
明日香感到屈辱，这原来是个陷阱，她和绫波直接走了进去。为什么她没能预见到？而现在，她又一次无能为力，只能试图用言语进行某种抵抗，“你们想从我这里得到什么？”

"That's pretty simple Asuka, you're here because we needed a subject to test a new course of treatment on. First of all, let us learn a bit more about you, it will make the process a lot easier. How old were you when your mother died Asuka?"  
"这很简单，明日香，你在这里是因为我们需要一个对象来测试一种新的治疗方案。首先，让我们多了解你一些，这会让整个过程顺利许多。你母亲去世时你几岁，明日香？"

Asuka glared at her, wanting to tear the woman apart for asking that. She couldn't do anything though instead she opted to just reply. "I don't know what business it is of yours but I was eight."  
明日香瞪着她，恨不得将这个女人撕成碎片，就因为她问了那个问题。但她什么也做不了，只能选择回答：“我不知道这关你什么事，但我当时八岁。”

"I see. And tell me Asuka, how exactly did your mother die?"  
“我明白了。那么，告诉我明日香，你母亲究竟是怎么死的？”

Asuka closed her eyes, the memory of that incident coming back to her. She shouted back at the woman, "Why are you doing this? You already know how, if you're going to kill me go ahead and do it."  
明日香闭上眼睛，那段记忆再次涌上心头。她对着那个女人大喊：“你为什么要这么做？你明明知道是怎么回事，如果要杀我就直接动手吧。”

"Fine, I was hoping we would be able to make this easier but you leave me no choice. The inject we gave you prior to you waking up should be taking effect now anyway, if you'll turn your attention towards the screen."  
“好吧，我本希望我们能更轻松地解决这件事，但你逼我别无选择。在你醒来之前注射的药物现在应该开始起效了，如果你愿意看向屏幕的话。”

Asuka tried to turn away but found herself unable to. Something was compelling her, forcing her to look. The screen suddenly flickered into life, at first it just showed a black screen. Suddenly text from various languages began to scroll by, English, German, Japanese none of it made any sense though. The text, it was just gibberish, though now and then Asuka felt an immense pain shoot through her skull. She looked up at the screen and screamed out loud at what she saw. The images, they were all from her. Each one from her mind. She screamed out.  
明日香试图转过头去，却发现无法动弹。有什么东西在强迫她看。屏幕突然亮了起来，起初只显示一个黑屏。突然间，各种语言的文字开始滚动，英语、德语、日语，尽管如此，她却完全看不懂。那些文字，只是些胡言乱语，但时不时地，明日香感到一阵剧痛穿透她的头颅。她抬头看向屏幕，对着所见之物尖叫出声。那些图像，全都是关于她的。每一张都来自她的内心。她尖叫着。

"No! Get out my head!"  
“不！从我脑子里滚出去！”

More images flashed by. As the pain intensified, she tried her hardest to turn away but was unable to. The images weren't just on the screen anymore, they were inside her mind. They were in front of her, all around her, tearing her apart.  
更多的影像闪过。随着痛苦加剧，她竭尽全力想要转过头去，却无能为力。这些影像不再仅限于屏幕上，它们侵入了她的脑海。它们在她眼前，环绕着她，将她撕裂。

"No, stop it, stop raping my mind. Please stop."  
“不，停下来，别再侵犯我的思想。求求你，停下来。”

**GEHIRN Hospital Wing GEHIRN 医院翼**

"It's so tragic." “真是太悲惨了。”

The other nurse shook her head, "I know, she doesn't even recognize her own daughter anymore. The doctors said she's already attempted suicide, I can't imagine the effect it's having on her daughter."  
另一位护士摇了摇头，“我知道，她甚至认不出自己的女儿了。医生说她已经尝试过自杀，我无法想象这对她女儿的影响有多大。”

"Her father hasn't even visited either, they say that it was he who shot her and left her like this after some argument."  
"她父亲也从未来探望过，他们说就是他在一次争吵后开枪打伤了她，然后就这样弃之不顾。"

"It must be so horrible for the daughter, she's only eight years of age. She just comes along and looks at her mother through the window. She doesn't cry or say anything, she just looks in at her mother and that doll."  
"对那个小女孩来说一定很可怕，她才八岁。她只是走过来，透过窗户看着她妈妈和那个娃娃。她不哭也不说什么，只是静静地看着她妈妈和那个娃娃。"

Asuka ignored the nurses as they walked past her, they didn't know anything. They said her mama was in a bad state, but it wasn't true. Her mother was strong, just like she was. She was fine, everything would be alright, they didn't need anyone. From inside she could hear her mother talking to that doll.  
明日香无视从她身边走过的护士们，她们什么都不懂。她们说她妈妈情况很糟，但这不是真的。她妈妈很坚强，就像她一样。她没事，一切都会好起来的，她们不需要任何人。从里面她能听到她妈妈在和那个娃娃说话。

Asuka hated dolls, she had never liked them, and now her mother had chosen one over her. She hated it, she hated the way it had taken her mother from her.  
明日香讨厌娃娃，她从未喜欢过它们，而现在她的母亲却选择了一个娃娃而不是她。她恨它，恨它夺走了她的母亲。

"Look at that girl out there Asuka, she wants to take you away from me. She wants you to die so that I'll have nothing. Your father ran off, he abandoned us. Our work colleagues betrayed us, we only wanted to help."  
“看看外面的那个女孩，明日香，她想把你从我身边夺走。她想让你死，这样我就一无所有了。你父亲跑了，他抛弃了我们。我们的同事背叛了我们，我们只是想帮忙。”

The words cut through her like a knife, she tried to ignore them but every night they were there. Haunting her when she slept. Her mama didn't even know her anymore.  
这些话像刀子一样刺穿她，她试图忽视它们，但每个夜晚它们都在那里。在她睡觉时萦绕不去。她的妈妈甚至不再认识她了。

**GEHIRN Hospital Wing – Three Weeks Later  
GEHIRN 医院翼楼——三周后**

Asuka ran up the hospital corridor towards her mother's room. She had done it, she had been chosen to help at GEHIRN. She was going to be a real scientist just like her mother. She got to the door and began shouting excitedly.  
明日香沿着医院走廊跑向她母亲的房间。她做到了，她被选中在 GEHIRN 帮忙。她即将成为像她母亲一样的真正科学家。她跑到门口，兴奋地大喊起来。

"Mama, they want me to help them. They chose me out of all the others, they told me I was special."  
“妈妈，他们要我帮忙。他们从所有人中选了我，他们说我特别。”

Her hand reached out for the door knob as she was still shouting excitedly. The shouting stopped when she entered the room though. It was only met with complete silence, she walked forward whispering, "Mama?"  
她的手伸向门把手，依旧兴奋地喊着。然而，一进房间，喊声便戛然而止。迎接她的只有一片死寂，她轻步向前，低声唤道：“妈妈？”

She looked down and saw a small trickle of red liquid. She looked up and saw her mother hanging from the ceiling of the hospital room. Asuka felt a tear rolling down her cheek as she began to sob.  
她低头一看，发现一小股红色液体缓缓流下。抬头望去，只见母亲悬在病房的天花板上。明日香感到一滴泪水滑过脸颊，开始啜泣起来。

**Unknown Location 未知地点**

Asuka was screaming out and sobbing at this point, at the memories of her mother. She didn't care anymore who could hear her. She didn't care that she was crying, that she looked weak.  
此时，明日香正尖叫着，抽泣着，沉浸在对母亲的回忆中。她不再在乎谁会听到她的声音。她不在乎自己在哭泣，不在乎自己显得软弱。

"Why...why are you doing this, why are you showing me this?"  
“为什么...为什么要这样对我，为什么要让我看到这些？”

"It won't be much longer now Asuka, in fact we have a treat for you."  
“不会太久了，明日香，事实上，我们为你准备了一个惊喜。”

**GEHIRN Laboratories GEHIRN 实验室**

"I don't want any part of this anymore, Ikari. I'll be leaving tomorrow, I'll be taking my daughter to America."  
“我不想再参与这件事了，碇。我明天就离开，我要带我女儿去美国。”

Kyoko turned around from him angrily. He merely stood behind her and watched her move back towards the small computer. He tried once again to persuade her.  
京子愤怒地从他身边转过身去。他只是站在她身后，看着她走回那台小电脑前。他再次试图说服她。

"If you leave you'll only make it worse, SEELE won't forgive you. Keel will most likely try to kill both you and your daughter."  
“如果你离开，只会让情况更糟，SEELE 不会原谅你。基尔很可能试图杀死你和你女儿。”

"Keels already promised us our freedom, as long as we don't speak of the project we will be safe."  
“基尔已经承诺给我们自由，只要我们不透露这个项目，我们就会安全。”

"Do you really believe that? Do you really believe Keel will just let you and your daughter go free after all the effort he put into gaining you both? How can you trust him?"  
"你真的相信吗？你真的相信基尔会因为你们俩付出了这么多努力而轻易放你和你的女儿自由吗？你怎么能信任他？"

Kyoko stood up and turned off the computer monitor snapping back at Gendo, "I trust him because if it wasn't for Keel I wouldn't have a daughter right now. She's all I have Gendo, what sort of future does she have with Gehirn? I want her to have a normal life, I can't do this."  
绫波站起来，关掉了电脑显示器，对源堂反驳道：“我信任他，因为如果不是基尔，我现在就不会有一个女儿。她是我唯一的亲人，源堂，她在 GEHIRN 能有什么样的未来？我希望她能过上正常的生活，我做不到这些。”

"So you're just going to turn around and leave knowing what they're planning here? We can change that, Yui is already attempting to make modifications."  
"所以你就这样转身离开，明知他们在这里的计划？我们可以改变这一点，唯已经在尝试进行修改了。"

Kyoko moved past him and spoke softly, "Then I wish her the best of luck, but I can't do this. For Asuka's sake, she already doesn't have a father. I don't want her to grow up without a mother as well."  
Kyoko 从他身边走过，轻声说道：“那我祝她好运，但我不能这么做。为了 Asuka，她已经没有父亲了。我不想让她连母亲也没有。”

**Unknown Location 未知地点**

The barrage continued, it was no longer just the images of her mother, or the hanging dolls. Now they were moving rapidly and had moved onto something else. Asuka tried to shut her eyes but she could still see them. Each image flashed before her quickly, each one only a split second but each one stuck out.  
攻击持续不断，不再只是她母亲的影像或悬挂的玩偶。现在它们快速移动，转向了其他东西。Asuka 试图闭上眼睛，但她仍然能看到它们。每个图像在她眼前迅速闪过，虽然每张只停留一瞬间，但每一个都异常鲜明。

_... A hanging doll... ...一个悬挂的玩偶..._

_Shinji... 真嗣..._

_Her mother... 她的母亲..._

_..Touji's death... ..东治的死..._

_Her being stabbed by Zereul...  
她被 Zereul 刺伤..._

_Shinji being taken from her...  
真嗣被从她身边带走..._

"No stop this, please stop it."  
“不，停下来，请停下来。”

The images didn't stop, they continued rolling past.  
那些影像并未停止，它们继续滚动着掠过。

_...First meeting with Shinji...  
...与真嗣的初次相遇..._

She screamed out again, "Why are you showing me this?"  
她再次尖叫起来，“为什么你要给我看这些？”

_...The events on the Over The Rainbow...  
...《跨越彩虹》的事件..._

"Please stop this!" "请停止这一切！"

_...Shinji being captured by Leliel...  
...真嗣被雷里尔捕获..._

Suddenly the images stopped, the woman at the front looked around frantically and looked up smiling.  
突然间，画面停止了，站在前方的女子慌乱地环顾四周，随即抬头微笑。

"Well it looks like your friends found us."  
“看来你的朋友们找到我们了。”

A loud noise tore through the sky as Asuka screamed out. She watched on as the woman projected an A.T. Field to try to deflect the bullet. The woman smiled arrogantly as she shouted back at the attacker. A person in a black helicopter circling nearby.  
随着明日香尖叫一声，巨大的噪音划破天际。她眼看着那女子展开 A.T.力场试图挡开子弹。女子傲然一笑，对着攻击者大声回喊。攻击者正乘坐一架黑色直升机在附近盘旋。

"How does it feel to know you came all this way for...?"  
"得知你一路走来，最终却只为了...？"

Her face changed to a look of immense pain and shock as another bullet was fired, this time tearing through her A.T. Field like it was nothing. The woman dropped to the floor as Asuka tried to take a look at the person who had apparently saved her from all this. Before she could see anything else she passed out from the pain.  
她的面容因剧痛和震惊而扭曲，又一发子弹射出，这次轻而易举地撕裂了她的 A.T.力场。女子倒在地上，而明日香试图看清那个显然救了她的人。但在她能看清任何东西之前，剧痛让她昏厥过去。

### Chapter 26 Withdrawal

_10__th_ _October 2015_ 2015 年 10 月 10 日

**Hospital Room – 1300 hours  
医院病房 – 下午 1 点**

Misato looked down at Asuka's body, every so often it would move and twitch and Asuka would whimper like she was caught in some eternal nightmare. For three days she had been like this, ever since Nagisa and Arael had exposed her to those projections. The nurses had assured Misato that Asuka would awaken, it was just a matter of when.  
美里低头看着明日香的身躯，时不时地，她的身体会抽动一下，明日香会发出呜咽声，仿佛被困在永恒的噩梦中。自从渚和亚拉尔向她展示那些投影以来，她已经这样三天了。护士们向美里保证明日香会醒来，只是时间问题。

The scariest moment had been shortly after they brought her back, when Asuka had opened her eyes. They were so lifeless, and it was just as if they had been replaced by black holes. They were no longer looking at the person, but through them. Even then she hadn't been responsive at all, she was awake in name only. Her body functioned, but her mind and soul were cut off from the world.  
最可怕的时刻是在他们把她带回来后不久，明日香睁开了眼睛。那双眼睛毫无生气，仿佛被黑洞所取代。它们不再注视着人，而是透过他们。即便那时，她也没有任何反应，只是名义上的清醒。她的身体在运作，但她的心灵和灵魂与世界隔绝了。

Misato had spent all the time she could visiting her, just hoping she would wake up. She felt in a way as if she was to blame for what had happened. She had been so wrapped up in what had happened to Shinji she had not noticed or even thought about how badly it had affected Asuka. She knew it had affected her, that much was obvious, but she should have taken into account the other factors surrounding her. Her past, her pride, if Misato had thought about it she would have acted quicker and hopefully been able to prevent this.  
美里尽可能抽出所有时间来探望她，只是希望她能醒来。她感到某种程度上自己对发生的事情负有责任。她一直沉浸在真嗣遭遇的事情中，没有注意到甚至没有想过这对明日香的影响有多严重。她知道这对明日香有影响，这一点很明显，但她本应考虑到围绕她的其他因素。她的过去，她的骄傲，如果美里考虑过这些，她本可以更快采取行动，或许就能防止这一切的发生。

She sighed and leaned back in her seat, this couldn't carry on she thought to herself. First Shinji had gone and now Asuka was pretty much comatose for an indefinite amount of time. Everything around them was falling apart, there was a heavy stench of inevitability wherever she went now. That no matter what they did they would be unable to prevent SEELE from carrying out their plans.  
她叹了口气，靠回椅背上，她心想，这不能再继续下去了。先是真嗣出事，现在明日香几乎陷入无限期的昏迷。他们周围的一切都在崩溃，无论走到哪里，都有一种沉重的宿命感。无论他们做什么，都无法阻止 Seele 执行他们的计划。

_'Is there no hope left? Shinji is gone, Asuka is like this and Rei was badly beaten up in Asuka's rescue attempt. If SEELE attempts anything now they'd have little to no resistance. Was this what they planned to do? Sacrifice the remaining Angels after Leliel to weaken the Evangelions and then take them out one at a time?'  
“难道就没有希望了吗？真嗣不见了，明日香成了这样，而绫波在营救明日香的尝试中被打得遍体鳞伤。如果 SEELE 现在采取行动，他们几乎不会遇到任何抵抗。这就是他们的计划吗？在击败雷里尔之后的剩余使徒中削弱 EVA，然后逐个击破？”_

She stood up and walked towards the window. It had rained non-stop since they had brought her back. A flash of lighting tore through the sky as she watched the rain drops stream down the window. She silently wished she could leave this all behind, to go some place else and forget all about it. Forget about NERV, forget about SEELE, about the Angels or the invasion. Why couldn't it all be over before it caused them any more pain?  
她站起身，走向窗边。自从他们把她带回来后，雨就一直没有停过。一道闪电划破天际，她看着雨滴顺着窗户流淌。她默默地希望自己能抛下这一切，去往别处，忘掉所有。忘掉 NERV，忘掉 SEELE，忘掉使徒或入侵。为什么这一切不能在给他们带来更多痛苦之前结束呢？

_'Even if I do survive, what sort of world is my child going to be born into? SEELE's world where humanity has been reprogrammed into a 'perfect existence' or a desolate wasteland where we only just survived. SEELE won't even let my baby be, they want that as well, are they just going to take everything from us. How is that a perfect existence?  
"“即使我能活下来，我的孩子将出生在什么样的世界？SEELE 的世界，人类被重新编程成‘完美存在’，还是一个我们仅能勉强生存的荒凉废土。SEELE 甚至不会放过我的孩子，他们也想要这个，他们是要从我们这里夺走一切。那样的存在，怎能称之为完美？”_

Behind her Misato heard the door to the room opening. She turned and saw Rei entering the room. Misato smiled and greeted the agent. Ayanami had spent quite a bit of time visiting Asuka as well, something Misato had found rather unusual considering the two agents attitude towards each other, or at least Asuka's attitude towards Rei.  
在她身后，Misato 听到房间的门打开了。她转过身，看到 Rei 走进房间。Misato 微笑着向这位特工打招呼。绫波也花了不少时间来探望明日香，这让 Misato 觉得颇为不寻常，考虑到两位特工之间的态度，至少是明日香对绫波的态度。

"Hello Rei, sorry to inform you but there's been no change."  
“你好，Rei，很抱歉告诉你，情况没有变化。”

Rei looked across at Asuka's still form. The news seemed to sadden her slightly. It showed even more in her voice when she spoke. "I see..."  
Rei 望向明日香静止不动的身体。这个消息似乎让她有些难过。当她开口说话时，声音中流露出的悲伤更加明显。“我明白了……”

"They said she could wake up at any time though."  
"但他们说，她随时都可能醒来。"

"Then I hope it is soon."  
"那我希望是很快。"

"We all do, I just wish there was some way we could have prevented this from happening."  
"我们都这么希望，我只是希望有办法能阻止这一切发生。"

"Sohryu is a proud person, she closed herself off to other people. There wasn't anything we could have done."  
"惣流是个自尊心很强的人，她封闭了自己，不让别人接近。我们无能为力。"

Misato looked over at Rei, slightly confused. She had never expected Rei to say something like that. She wasn't really sure what Rei had even meant by it, was she saying that Asuka brought it on herself? Surely she couldn't have meant that, she must have meant something else.  
美里略带困惑地看向丽。她从未料到丽会说出这样的话。她不太确定丽到底是什么意思，是在说明日香自作自受吗？她肯定不是这个意思，一定是别的什么含义。

"So Asuka did this to herself?"  
"所以明日香是自己造成的这一切？"

Rei shook her head, "No, Keel did this to her. He took her mother from her, he took Shinji from her and now he took her pride from her."  
丽摇了摇头，“不，这是基尔做的。他夺走了她的母亲，他夺走了真嗣，现在他又夺走了她的骄傲。”

_22__nd_ _October 2015_ 2015 年 10 月 22 日

**NERV Offices – 1000 hours  
NERV 总部办公室 —— 上午十点  
**Rei entered the office and took her jacket off, hanging it up behind the door. Another day she thought to herself, it had been some time since she had visited Sohryu and in that time she had continued working at NERV alone. Asuka had actually woken up later that day, but by the time Rei got to the hospital she had already checked herself out and had gone home.  
丽走进办公室，脱下外套，挂在门后。又是一天，她心想，自从上次拜访惣流已经有一段时间了，这段时间她一直在 NERV 独自工作。那天，明日香其实晚些时候才醒来，但当丽赶到医院时，她已经自行出院回家了。

She hadn't returned to NERV yet, although Rei didn't really expect her to just yet. Asuka would have needed a bit more time. Time to get her guard back in place and prepare to return. Rei hoped that she would return sooner rather than later. She had wanted to return to NERV, requested to return here because of Asuka and Shinji. Because they made her feel like she was more than just a tool.  
她还没有回到 NERV，尽管丽并不真的期望她现在就回来。明日香还需要更多时间。时间来重新竖起防线，准备回归。丽希望她能早些回来，而不是晚些。她本想回到 NERV，请求回到这里是因为明日香和真嗣。因为他们让她觉得自己不仅仅是一个工具。

She cast her mind back to a few weeks ago, to when Keel had confronted her in the park and mentioned her origins and asked her to help him. He had told her she had no purpose, that she was just a doll for Gendo to discard as he wished. Was that true? Was that why she wanted so desperately to see Asuka again, before this she had not cared either way? She had grown a minor attachment to her work colleagues but that was it. Now it was more, they treated her differently than what she was used to.  
她回想起几周前，基尔在公园里与她对峙，提及她的出身并请求她帮助他。他告诉她，她没有目的，只是任由碇源堂随意丢弃的玩偶。这是真的吗？这就是为什么她如此迫切地想再见明日香一面，而在此之前她并不在乎吗？她对同事们产生了些许依恋，但仅此而已。现在不同了，他们对待她的方式与她习惯的不同。

She sighed and sat down at her desk, powering on the computer. She waited a few moments for it to load up so she could spend yet another day looking at nothing. She didn't have any work to do, there were no cases to investigate for her. There was only SEELE and Marduk and nothing they could do about that for some time. They were lucky to get away last time and they were even luckier that there wasn't a backlash from SEELE.  
她叹了口气，坐在桌前，启动了电脑。她等待片刻，直到屏幕亮起，准备迎接又一天无所事事的日子。她手头没有工作，也没有案件需要调查。只有 SEELE 和 Marduk，而他们暂时对此无能为力。上次能侥幸逃脱已是万幸，更幸运的是 SEELE 并未因此反扑。

_'That was what they wanted, they wanted us to attack them so they could capture Sohryu and take me out of it. They didn't take me so that I'd be able to get back there and rescue her after the damage had been done...but why?'  
“这就是他们想要的，他们希望我们攻击他们，以便抓住 Sohryu 并把我排除在外。他们没有抓我，是为了让我能在事态恶化后回去救她……但为什么？”_

Rei had been thinking of that since the rescue, even she knew it was too easy that they were in and out like nothing. It couldn't have been luck, did SEELE want that to happen, were they meant to go back?  
自从救援行动以来，Rei 一直在思考这个问题，甚至连她都感觉到，他们进出得太过轻松，仿佛一切都不费吹灰之力。这不可能仅仅是运气，难道 SEELE 希望这一切发生，他们是否注定要回去？

"Ayanami." "绫波。"

Rei looked around. She had been so lost in her own thoughts she had not noticed the door opening nor had she noticed Agent Sohryu stepping through it.  
丽环顾四周。她沉浸在自己的思绪中，以至于没有注意到门被打开，也没有注意到碇司令走了进来。

"Agent Sohryu." "碇司令。"

"Well not exactly the major greeting that befits someone like me but I guess it'll do. So what did I miss?"  
"好吧，虽然不是那种适合我这种人的隆重问候，但我想也凑合了。我错过了什么？"

It was strange, Asuka was actually smiling and seemed to be in a good mood. After all that had happened she actually appeared to be happy, was this just another façade? Asuka had been through so much it just seemed strange that she'd be in such good spirits.  
这很奇怪，明日香竟然在微笑，看起来心情很好。经历了那么多事情后，她居然显得很开心，这是否只是另一层伪装？明日香经历了太多，她现在的好心情显得有些不寻常。

"I did not expect you back today."  
"我没想到你今天会回来。"

"Well I got bored at home and decided that you guys wouldn't get anywhere without me, so I came back in."  
“我在家无聊透顶，觉得你们没有我肯定一事无成，所以我就回来了。”

Asuka made her way over to her desk and sat down. She had to come back. It wasn't because she was bored, it was before she could feel herself going insane on her own. As much as she had tried to forget about the attack, forget about the mind rape and her mother, she couldn't. Every living moment she was being haunted by it. She sensed that it was only a matter or time before she got even worse and returned to how she was in the hospital, only this time permanently.  
明日香走到自己的桌子旁坐下。她不得不回来。并非因为无聊，而是因为她感觉自己快要独自发疯了。尽管她努力忘记那次袭击，忘记心灵上的侵犯和她母亲，但她做不到。每一刻她都感到被这些记忆纠缠。她意识到，自己只会越来越糟，最终可能永远回到医院里的状态。

She looked across at Rei and suddenly felt a flash of anger tear through her. It was her fault, she let that happen to her. She made her like this. From the very first day she had met Rei she had only had bad things happen to her. First meeting she was injured, when she returned Shinji was abducted and she nearly killed and now recently she had her mind torn from her.  
她看向丽，突然一股怒火涌上心头。都是她的错，是她让自己遭受这一切。是她让自己变成这样。从遇见丽的第一天起，她就只有糟糕的经历。第一次见面就受伤，回来后真嗣被绑架，自己差点丧命，最近更是心灵被撕裂。

_'I can't think like this, it's not right. Everything is so fucked up right now. She isn't to blame, it was SEELE. I can understand that but I still hate her...I hate her because she's such a doll, she'll do anything blindly without questioning it...if she was told to kill herself she would.'  
“我不能这样想，这不正确。现在一切都乱套了。她不该受责备，是 SEELE 的错。我能理解，但我还是恨她……我恨她因为她就像个傀儡，盲目执行命令，从不质疑……如果有人让她自杀，她也会照做。”_

"Agent Sohryu, are you feeling all right?"  
“草薙特工，你感觉还好吗？”

_'Is she showing concern? No, it's just a load of crap, its guilt because she knows she was to blame...'  
“她在表示关心吗？不，都是些废话，只是内疚，因为她知道自己有责任……”_

Asuka clutched her head. She knew immediately it was a mistake coming back here. It felt as if her mind had been torn into several pieces. She didn't know what to do or feel any more, but what else could she have done? Stayed at home and suffered through the nightmares and hallucinations or came back in and went through this? She didn't have a choice any more.  
明日香紧抱着头。她立刻意识到回到这里是个错误。感觉就像她的思维被撕成了几片。她不知道该做什么或感受什么，但她还能怎么做呢？留在家里忍受噩梦和幻觉，还是回到这里经历这一切？她已经别无选择了。

_'Why...why am I like this, why is it me that has to suffer like this? I hate this, I wish I could end it.'  
'为什么...为什么是我要承受这些？我讨厌这样，我真希望这一切能结束。'_

The idea had crossed her mind a few days ago, the idea of ending it. She had been so close, holding the blade in her trembling hands, waiting to make the cut, but she didn't. She wasn't like that, she was stronger than that.  
几天前，她脑海中闪过结束一切的念头。她曾那么接近，颤抖的手中握着刀片，等待着划下那一刀，但她没有。她不是那样的人，她比那更坚强。

_'Yeah, strong enough that I'm breaking down in front of someone like Ayanami. I need to get out of here for a few moments. I'll be fine if I can just get out the office and clear my head, I probably rushed myself.  
“是啊，强烈到我在像绫波这样的人面前崩溃。我需要出去一会儿。只要能离开办公室，清醒一下头脑，我就会没事的，可能是我太急了。”_

She turned to Ayanami and finally responded, "I'm all right, just still got a bit of a headache that's all. I might be suffering from them for some time. I just need something to take my mind off them."  
她转向绫波，终于回应道：“我没事，只是还有点头疼。可能还要忍受一段时间。我只是需要点东西来转移注意力。”

Asuka looked up and screamed out loudly, she knew it wasn't real, that is wasn't there and that she shouldn't be acting like this. She gazed at the hanging doll, her eyes fixed on its lifeless button eyes as it slowly span around. She quickly averted her gaze from the doll and down towards her desk, the hallucinations were following her here as well, there was no escape, no running away from them.  
明日香抬头大声尖叫，她知道这不是真的，它并不存在，她不应该这样表现。她凝视着悬挂的玩偶，目光紧盯着它那无生命的纽扣眼睛，看着它缓缓旋转。她迅速移开视线，低头看向自己的桌子，幻觉也跟着她到了这里，无处可逃，无法逃避。

Rei quickly leapt up from her seat and made her way over to Asuka, to check on her colleague. She looked around the room, trying to find what Asuka seemed to be avoiding looking at something in the middle of the room. She appeared to be looking to see if it was there and then averting her eyes. There was nothing there but she could sense something. She heard Asuka whimpering slightly as she gently laid a hand on her back.  
绫波丽迅速从座位上跳起，走向明日香，关心她的同事。她环顾房间，试图找出明日香似乎在避开房间中央的什么东西。她似乎在确认那东西是否存在，然后又移开视线。那里空无一物，但她能感觉到某种存在。她听到明日香轻微的呜咽声，便轻轻地将手放在她的背上。

Asuka herself leapt up and pushed Rei away from her shouting out, "What are you doing? I don't need your help, I don't need anyone's help!"  
明日香自己跳了起来，推开绫波丽，大声喊道：“你在干什么？我不需要你的帮助，我不需要任何人的帮助！”

Rei didn't know how to respond. She just stood there taking the brunt of Asuka's verbal attack, "Why would I want help from someone like you, I hate you, I hate everything here just...leave me alone!"  
绫波丽不知如何回应。她只是站在那里承受着明日香的言语攻击，“我为什么要接受像你这样的人的帮助，我讨厌你，我讨厌这里的一切，就...让我一个人待着！”

Asuka turned and dashed out of the room, slamming the door behind her. Rei went to follow but then remembered what Asuka had just told her. Rei stood there looking towards the centre of the room, shivering slightly and also disturbed at what had just happened. She couldn't see it, but she knew it was there. For the first time, she was truly scared for what would happen to them.  
明日香转身冲出房间，砰地一声甩上门。丽本想跟上去，却突然记起明日香刚刚告诉她的话。丽站在原地，目光投向房间中央，微微颤抖，心中也为刚刚发生的事感到不安。她虽然看不见，但她知道它就在那里。这是她第一次真正为他们的未来感到恐惧。

**Meeting Room – 1430 hours  
会议室 – 14 时 30 分**

Gendo sat facing directly ahead, his hands folded neatly in front of him as per usual and his face a stoic unchanging expression. He spoke calmly to the rest of the occupants of the room, "Rei has delivered me some interesting news regarding Agent Sohryu."  
碇源堂正襟危坐，双手一如既往地整齐叠放在面前，脸上保持着那副不变的肃穆表情。他平静地对房间里的其他人说道：“丽向我汇报了一些关于草薙特工的有趣消息。”

"So interesting is how you word it now? You mean how she came in today and left after just over ten minutes in tears?"  
"现在你这么表达很有趣吗？你是说她今天进来，只待了十多分钟就哭着离开了？"

Gendo nodded, ignoring Misato's anger, "Correct, I knew there might have been some after effects to what Nagisa and Arael did to her but I wasn't expecting this. I fear I might have made a mistake by ordering them to go into Marduk. SEELE were expecting it and prepared a trap, we fell for it."  
碇源堂点了点头，无视美里子的愤怒，"没错，我知道渚薰和亚拉尔对她做的事可能会有一些后遗症，但我没想到会这么严重。我担心我可能犯了个错误，命令他们进入马尔杜克。SEELE 早有预料并设下了陷阱，我们中计了。"

"You ordered them to go into Marduk? What the hell were you thinking? Do you think you can just order them about like tools of you-?"  
"你命令他们进入马尔杜克？你到底在想什么？你以为你可以像对待工具一样随意命令他们吗？"

Gendo promptly interrupted her, "Put your personal feelings aside for a moment Katsuragi. May I remind you that I am still the Director of NERV and you all work for NERV. Meaning you are all under my command and not free to act on your own personal agenda. I have been lenient with Sohryu and my son in the past and treat them differently to other Agents under my command."  
源堂立刻打断了她，“暂时抛开你的个人情感吧，葛城。请允许我提醒你，我仍是 NERV 的指挥官，而你们所有人都是为 NERV 工作的。这意味着你们都在我的指挥之下，不能随心所欲地按照个人议程行事。过去我对惣流和我儿子一直宽容，对待他们与手下其他特工不同。”

"By treat them differently you mean use them for your own ends?"  
“所谓对待不同，是指利用他们达成你的目的吗？”

"Everything I have done I have done for the future of humanity, Katsuragi. If ensuring humanity has a future means risking the life of my own son then so be it."  
“我所做的一切都是为了人类的未来，葛城。如果确保人类拥有未来意味着要冒着我儿子生命的风险，那么就这样吧。”

"How can you even say that you bastard? You'd let your own son die just to stop Keel?"  
"你怎么能这么说你这个混蛋？为了阻止基尔，你甚至愿意让自己的儿子去死？"

"He would willingly do so anyway."  
"他本来就愿意这么做。"

Kaji quickly acted and grabbed hold of Misato before she was able to leap up off of her seat. She shouted at him, tears in her eyes, "How can you even say such a thing? You didn't even know Shinji, you abandoned him because it was convenient for you. I was the one who took him in and brought him up when he had nothing or no one to turn to."  
加持迅速行动，抓住了美里，阻止她从座位上跳起来。她含泪对他喊道：“你怎么能说出这样的话？你根本不了解真嗣，你抛弃他只是因为对你方便。是我收留了他，在他一无所有、无人依靠的时候抚养他。”

Fuyutsuki quickly saw how this was going to turn out and made a move to stop the argument. "Agent Katsuragi please settle down for a moment, we can save this dispute for later. As of now we have more important things to worry about. Namely finding Shinji and also preventing further damage to Agent Sohryu."  
冬月很快看出了这场争执的结局，并采取行动制止了争吵。“葛城美里特工，请冷静一下，我们可以稍后再解决这个争议。现在我们有更重要的事情要担心。主要是找到真嗣，同时防止对绫波零特工造成进一步伤害。”

Misato sat back down, breathing heavily, "Okay fine, what is this news you received from Ayanami?"  
美里坐回原位，呼吸沉重，“好吧，你从绫波那里收到了什么消息？”

"It is regarding the incident earlier today. At first I dismissed the incident as a hallucination relating to what had happened back at the Island Facility but Rei told me that she could feel something there. That whatever Sohryu saw was real, only she herself could not see it."  
“这是关于今天早些时候的事件。起初我以为那只是与岛屿设施发生的事情有关的幻觉，但绫波告诉我她能感觉到那里有什么。她说绫波零看到的东西是真实的，只是她自己看不见。”

Kaji offered his own insight into what had happened, "Asuka came to me shortly after she fled from the office. I've never seen her like that before, she was crying and just repeating the same things over and over again. That she didn't want to die and that she hated everything."  
加持提供了他对所发生事情的见解，“明日香从办公室逃出来后不久就来找我了。我从未见过她那样，她哭着，一遍又一遍重复同样的话。说她不想死，说她恨一切。”

It was true, he had seen Asuka at a vulnerable point before in the past but he had never seen her this bad before. He was truly concerned that if they didn't help her quickly that she would only get worse.  
确实，他过去曾见过明日香脆弱的一面，但从未见过她如此糟糕。他真的担心，如果他们不尽快帮助她，她只会变得更糟。

Gendo nodded and replied. This time, however, there was a distinct hint of sadness to his voice, "She is suffering from the same thing her mother did."  
碇源堂点头回应。然而这一次，他的声音中明显带着一丝悲伤，“她正遭受着和她母亲一样的痛苦。”

Misato looked across at him, Gendo knew about Asuka's mother? She had heard from Kaji what had happened but was that related to this as well?  
美里望向他，源堂知道明日香的母亲吗？她从加持那里听说过发生了什么，但那与这件事有关吗？

"What happened?" “发生了什么？”

Gendo shook his head, "I am doing everything I can. I have a small team researching her mother's case, but it is out of my hands. As for what happened to Asuka's mother, the details of that are unknown even to me. All I know is it was the day before she was due to leave GEHIRN, there was an incident in the labs and a few weeks later she committed suicide in her hospital room after suffering hallucinations."  
源堂摇了摇头，"我正在尽我所能。我有一个小团队在研究她母亲的案件，但这已超出我的掌控。至于明日香母亲发生了什么，连我也不清楚具体细节。我只知道，那是在她预定离开 GEHIRN 的前一天，实验室发生了事故，几周后她在医院病房因幻觉折磨而自杀。"

"I see, and you think the same thing is happening to Asuka?"  
"我明白了，你认为同样的事情正在发生在明日香身上吗？"

Fuyutsuki turned and looked out the meeting room window, voicing his opinion, "It's all fitting into place, they took Shinji out of the equation and then with only two Angels left they're going to take Asuka out of the equation. With only one Evangelion left we cannot defend ourselves. We will be an easy target for them."  
冬月转过身，望向会议室的窗外，表达了他的看法：“一切都在按计划进行，他们先把真嗣排除在外，然后只剩下两个使徒时，他们打算把明日香也排除在外。只剩下一台 EVA，我们无法自卫。我们将成为他们的易如反掌的目标。”

Gendo nodded, "Correct, we can no longer stage our initial attack on them. However, the fact that we still have the Adam DNA should be of concern to them. We also have what we learnt about the Island Facility thanks to Sohryu."  
碇源堂点头道：“没错，我们不能再对他们发起最初的攻击了。然而，我们仍然拥有亚当的 DNA，这应该让他们感到担忧。我们还从惣流那里了解到岛屿设施的情况。”

"Thanks to her getting captured you mean?"  
“你是说多亏了她被俘？”

"Her capture aided us significantly. We now know the layout of the island and location of the facility."  
“她的被捕极大地帮助了我们。现在我们知道了岛上的布局和设施的位置。”

Misato slammed her fist on the table, "So is that worth ruining her life?"  
美里一拳砸在桌上，“所以这就是毁了她一生的理由吗？”

Gendo smiled from behind his folded hands, "It was a sacrifice that was necessary, besides her life is not yet over."  
碇源堂双手交叠，微笑着说，“这是必要的牺牲，况且她的生命尚未终结。”

_24__th_ _October 2015_ 2015 年 10 月 24 日

**Marduk Island Facility – Unknown Time  
马尔杜克岛设施——未知时间**

Nagisa looked out across the facility and smiled. It would soon be time, he thought to himself. His reason for being born into this world would soon come to pass and then everything would change. It had been fifteen years since the impact, fifteen long years since the night he was brought into this form and fifteen years of waiting until this moment.  
渚眺望着设施，微笑着。他心想，时机即将到来。他降生于这个世界的理由很快就会实现，一切都将改变。自那次撞击以来已经过去了十五年，自从那个夜晚他以这种形态被带到这个世界以来已经过去了漫长的十五年，而等待这一刻也已有十五年。

His only regret was that he would not be around to see what all his work had accomplished. But then, that was a sacrifice that had to be made. Just like all the sacrifices that his brothers and sisters had made it was something that was necessary. He was just there to play a part, just as everyone else involved was there to do.  
他唯一的遗憾是无法亲眼见证自己努力的成果。但那是一种必须做出的牺牲，正如他的兄弟姐妹们所做出的牺牲一样，是必要的。他只是在那里扮演一个角色，正如其他所有人一样，各司其职。

_'Soon I shall have to return to the craft and then it shall be up to Shinji to make his decision.'  
'很快我就得回到工作中，接下来就要看真嗣自己如何决定了。'_

Another person entered the room, a female appearing to be around the same age as Nagisa. She shared the same silver hair. However, her hair flowed down to her shoulders. She looked out the window, her red eyes scanning the area. Watching the people moving back and forth.  
又一个人走进房间，是一位女性，看起来和渚差不多年纪。她有着同样的银色头发，但发丝垂至肩头。她望向窗外，红色的眼睛扫视着四周，观察着来来往往的人们。

"We have made all the proper preparations for your departure. They will be expecting you soon. How shall we handle the media during your absence this time?"  
"我们已经为您的离开做好了所有必要的准备。他们很快就会期待您的到来。这次您不在期间，我们该如何应对媒体？"

"I have left a pre-recorded message to be sent out to the major news outlets. Wait a week after my departure and then send it out. It is informing them that a private test of the vaccine has occurred and thus far the results are positive. They won't ask any questions after that."  
"我留下了一段预录信息，准备发送给各大新闻机构。等我离开一周后再发送出去。内容是通知他们疫苗的私人测试已经进行，到目前为止结果是积极的。这样一来，他们就不会再问任何问题了。"

"And what of Sohryu?" "那龙神呢？"

"Phase One appears to have been a success, the implant we attached to her seems to be working and sending back the appropriate data. Initiate Phase Two soon, I will observe the results from my station."  
"第一阶段似乎已经成功，我们植入她体内的装置似乎正在运作并传回适当的数据。尽快启动第二阶段，我将从我的岗位上观察结果。"

"Are you not worried that will compromise your position with Ikari?"  
"你不担心这会危及你在碇司令那里的地位吗？"

Nagisa smiled when she mentioned Shinji's name, "Shinji will soon have to make a choice. Everything he has done up to this point will hinge on this one choice, everything we have worked for up to this point will also hinge on it. He is the only one who can do what needs to be done. If he makes the right choice then all we have worked for will be able to go ahead."  
渚在提到真嗣的名字时微笑了，“真嗣很快就要做出一个选择。他迄今为止所做的一切都将取决于这个选择，我们迄今为止所努力的一切也将取决于它。他是唯一能完成必要任务的人。如果他做出了正确的选择，那么我们所努力的一切都将能够继续前进。”

"If he makes the wrong choice?"  
"如果他做出了错误的选择？"

"Then we all lose, I will have to make contact and it will be over."  
"那么我们都会输，我将不得不进行接触，一切就结束了。"

"I do not understand you Nagisa, it's almost like you've turned this into a game. Do not lose sight of what our purpose was, we are loyal to SEELE."  
"我不明白你，渚，这几乎像是你在把这变成一场游戏。不要忘记我们的初衷，我们对 SEELE 是忠诚的。"

"Of course. I understand that, but the future they have chosen for humanity may not be the correct one. The fate of humanity does not lie in our or SEELE's hands, it lies in the person sitting up there waiting for the person he trusts to return."  
当然。我明白这一点，但他们为人类选择未来可能并非正确。人类的命运并不掌握在我们或 SEELE 手中，而是掌握在那个坐在上面等待他所信任之人归来的人手中。

_25__th_ _October 2015_ 2015 年 10 月 25 日

She was alone, alone and cold as she sat up from the cold bed. She felt disorientated as she slowly got to her feet. This room she was in, where was it? It looked like a hospital operating theatre but there was a horrible sense of dread within her as she examined the room a bit more. The operating table in the middle was essentially nothing more than a cold steel slab. Next to it was a tray of various needles and instruments. A cold mist rose from the tray.  
她独自一人，孤独而寒冷地从冰冷的床上坐起。她感到迷茫，缓缓站起身来。这个房间，是哪里？它看起来像医院的手术室，但当她更仔细地打量四周时，心中涌起一股莫名的恐惧。中央的手术台不过是一块冰冷的钢板。旁边是一盘各式各样的针头和器械。冷雾从托盘上升起。

Next to the table there were what appeared to be straps to restrain the occupant. She shuddered as she ran her hand over the cold leather. Above her seemed to be another restraining device. This time it appeared to be for keeping the head in place. She ran her hand across the table again, wondering the true purpose of the table, the restraints, the tools and the stench of blood. Experimentation, was that it? Was this where they took people? Had Shinji been in a place like this?  
桌子旁边似乎有用来束缚住所处者的皮带。她摸着冰冷的皮革，不禁打了个寒颤。上方似乎还有另一个固定头部的装置。她再次抚摸桌子，思索着这张桌子、这些束缚带、工具以及血腥味的真正用途。是实验吗？这里就是他们带走人的地方吗？真嗣是否也曾身处这样的地方？

She heard a scream from outside the room and froze on the spot. That scream, the sound of that voice, it was so familiar. It couldn't have been though, he was gone. He couldn't have been here yet she had just heard him and he was in trouble. She reached into her jacket pocket, searching for her pistol and finding it with ease.  
她听到房间外传来一声尖叫，顿时僵在原地。那尖叫声，那个声音，如此熟悉。但不可能，他已经不在了。他不可能在这里，然而她刚刚确实听到了他的声音，而且他似乎陷入了麻烦。她伸手摸向夹克口袋，轻松找到了手枪。

_'Not as intelligent as they seem, leaving me with this. I'll teach them to capture me and stick me in a place like this.'  
"“看似聪明，却留下这个给我。我要让他们知道，抓我关在这种地方的后果。”_

She withdrew the pistol and smiled, edging towards the door. She looked out into the alien corridor, in the distance she could see two figures moving upwards.  
她收起手枪，微笑着向门口挪去。她向外望向那条异星走廊，远处可以看到两个身影正在向上移动。

_'Okay so I'm on one of the lower decks. This thing must be intact and moving though, so I need to find Shinji and then get this thing back. Maybe we can 'persuade' one of those things to take it back.'  
'好吧，我现在位于较低的甲板上。这东西一定完好无损并且还在移动，所以我得找到真嗣，然后让这东西返回。也许我们可以‘说服’其中一个家伙把它带回去。'_

She moved out into the deck and continued along slowly, being careful not to make any noise, then stopped as she came to an opening into another room and looked inside. It was a small room, probably only a couple of metres square. There were basic human amenities in there, leading Asuka to believe it was some kind of holding cell.  
她小心翼翼地走出甲板，继续缓慢前行，尽量避免发出任何声响，直到来到一个通向另一房间的开口处，她停下脚步向内望去。那是一个小房间，大概只有几平方米。里面有一些基本的人类生活设施，这让明日香推测这可能是一个拘留室。

She must be close then. If the holding cells were here then that meant Shinji could be here as well. But she had heard him screaming out. She had to be quick, especially if he was in danger. She moved out of the cell into the main corridor again and continued moving along it. The stench of LCL hit her nostrils as she willed herself not to throw up. She looked around at the pipes leading across various areas of the deck. An orange mist had formed around the pipes and she could see small droplets of LCL dripping down the walls and from the pipes.  
她一定就在附近。如果拘留室在这里，那就意味着真嗣也可能在这里。但她听到了他的尖叫声。她必须迅速行动，尤其是如果他处于危险之中。她走出牢房，再次进入主走廊，继续前行。LCL 的恶臭扑鼻而来，她努力克制自己不要呕吐。她环顾四周，看着管道横跨甲板各处。橙色的雾气在管道周围形成，她能看到 LCL 的小水滴从墙壁和管道上滴落。

_'I must be close now, I can almost sense him.'  
'我现在一定很接近了，我几乎能感觉到他。'_

She got to the end of the corridor and was left with two choices, she could either go up like she saw those two figures doing or move to the right. She could see more holding cells there. Maybe he was in one of those.  
她走到走廊的尽头，面临两个选择，她可以像那两个身影一样向上走，或者向右移动。她能看到那里的更多拘留室。也许他在其中一个里面。

She moved towards the second set of holding cells and began moving slowly. She felt her heart began to pound as the fear finally started to take hold of her. She stopped as she reached one of the open holding cells. Outside she could see a faint trail of blood leading into the cell, she turned her head and screamed out.  
她向第二组拘留室走去，开始缓慢移动。她感到心跳加速，恐惧终于开始占据她的心。当她走到一个敞开的拘留室前时停了下来。外面，她能看到一条淡淡的血迹通向室内，她转过头尖叫起来。

_'No...no, this can't be real...'  
'不...不，这不可能是真的...'_

**Asuka's Residence – 0345 hours  
明日香的家 —— 凌晨 03:45**

Her eyes shot open as she willed herself not to scream out. It was alright now, it was just another nightmare, and it wasn't real. She wiped her eyes and looked across at the small clock under her TV and had felt so real to her, she could still feel the cold air and was sure she could see the LCL dripping down her own walls. But it wasn't, it had just been a bad dream.  
她的眼睛猛地睁开，努力克制自己不要尖叫出声。现在没事了，这只是另一个噩梦，并非真实。她擦了擦眼睛，望向电视机下的小闹钟，那感觉如此真实，她仍能感受到冷风，确信自己能看到 LCL 从墙面上滴落。但那不是真的，只是一场糟糕的梦。

_'At least the hallucinations have stopped, I can't live like this anymore. Look at me, I'm pathetic. I'm so scared I need to sleep downstairs with the TV on.'  
“至少幻觉已经停止了，我不能再这样生活下去。看看我，多么可悲。我如此害怕，以至于需要开着电视睡在楼下。”_

The image she had seen in her nightmare slowly came back to her, that terrifying image that had caused her to scream out. It had seemed so real, the entire nightmare had been. From the waking to the end where she saw his dead body.  
梦中见到的景象缓缓回到她的脑海，那个令她尖叫的恐怖画面。它似乎如此真实，整个梦境都是如此。从醒来直到她看到他冰冷的尸体那一刻。

_'What did they do to me? Why did they do this? I'd rather they just killed me instead of this. I thought it would have stopped now, I thought I would have been able to forget and move on and just shove it away, but it's like every time I try to forget someone just forces it to the front of my mind.'  
“他们对我做了什么？为什么要这样对我？我宁愿他们直接杀了我。我以为这一切已经结束了，我以为我能忘记，继续前进，把这一切抛诸脑后，但每次我试图忘记，总有人把它推到我脑海的最前端。”_

She got up and made her way into the kitchen, pouring herself a glass of water. She stood there sipping the water, gazing up at the stars.  
她起身走进厨房，给自己倒了一杯水。她站在那里小口啜饮着水，凝望着星空。

_'He's out there and he's not dead. No matter how real that dream seemed he isn't dead. They did this to me, they're controlling me to try to make me think that, to try to weaken me. But I'll fight them. I'm stronger than this.'  
“他在外面，他还活着。无论那个梦看起来多么真实，他都没有死。他们对我做了这些，他们试图控制我，让我以为如此，试图削弱我。但我会反抗他们。我比这更强大。”_

She put the glass down and wiped her eyes again, desperately wishing she could stop crying.  
她放下玻璃杯，再次擦了擦眼睛，绝望地希望自己能停止哭泣。

_'I'm stronger than this, damn it.'  
'我比这更坚强，该死的。'_

_28__th_ _October 2015_ 2015 年 10 月 28 日

**Meeting Room – 1300 hours  
会议室 – 1300 时**

Asuka glared straight ahead. She wasn't budging on this no matter how much they disagreed with her. She wasn't going to be cast aside, she was as much a part of this as any of them were and after all she had been through she deserved to be a part of it. She didn't care about Misato's pleas that it was dangerous or Gendo's warning that in her current state she could be killed. Hell, Gendo was to blame for this, if he hadn't chosen her to be injected with the serum none of this would have happened.  
明日香直直地瞪着前方。无论他们如何反对，她都不会退让。她不会被排除在外，她和他们一样，都是这个团队的一部分，经历了这么多，她理应成为其中一员。她不在乎美里恳求说这很危险，也不在乎源堂警告说以她目前的状态可能会丧命。该死的，源堂才是这一切的罪魁祸首，如果不是他选择让她注射血清，这一切都不会发生。

Misato sighed and turned to the angered agent, "Look Asuka, I know how much you want to be a part of this but please reconsider. In your condition it might not be wise to go ahead with this."  
美里叹了口气，转向愤怒的特工，“听着，明日香，我知道你有多想参与这件事，但请重新考虑一下。以你现在的状况，继续下去可能不太明智。”

"My condition is just fine Misato, the hallucinations have stopped..." She paused for a brief moment before speaking again, her voice ripe with sarcasm "...and I'm glad you told everyone about them, I just love people knowing about how I am."  
"我的状况很好，美里，幻觉已经停止了..." 她停顿了一下，语气中充满了讽刺，"...我很高兴你把它们告诉了所有人，我真的很喜欢让大家知道我的情况。"

Gendo moved to cut her off, "Sohryu, it was me who ordered Katsuragi to explain what was happening. If you want to blame someone for that then blame me, but we have little time to play this game."  
源堂上前打断她，"草薙，是我命令葛城解释发生了什么的。如果你想为此责怪某人，那就怪我吧，但我们没有时间玩这种游戏。"

Asuka snarled and spoke, "Fine, but I want to know a good reason why I've been excluded from this. I'm still capable of carrying this out. I'll be more useful down there than on Radio support."  
明日香咆哮着说，"好吧，但我想知道为什么我被排除在外。我仍然有能力执行这个任务。我在下面会比在无线电支援上更有用。"

Gendo turned to his associate Fuyutsuki, hoping he could offer some insight. Gendo hadn't disclosed why he didn't want to send Sohryu, he couldn't tell her it would only make her condition worse. If she became aware of the implant SEELE would have her terminated immediately.  
源渡转向他的副手冬月，希望他能提供一些见解。源渡没有透露为什么不想派遣惣流，他不能告诉她这只会让她的状况恶化。如果她意识到植入体内的 SEELE 装置，他们将立即终止她的生命。

At the same time, she was right. She probably was capable of handling the assignment, but that would be under normal circumstances. She had been weakened and with SEELE putting that implant into her they could take her out at the worst possible moment. He tried to think of it logically, she was still useful even as she was. She could probably assist Rei and Kaji in getting into the facility before SEELE caught wind of her location.  
与此同时，她说的没错。她或许有能力完成任务，但那是在正常情况下。她已经变得虚弱，而 SEELE 在她体内植入的装置能在最糟糕的时刻将她击垮。他试图理性思考，即便如此，她仍然有用。她或许能在 SEELE 察觉之前协助丽和加持潜入设施。

On the other hand, he would be losing another Evangelion. He had already lost Shinji and losing another would be a huge blow to the cause. The rest of the group were already growing restless and he needed to keep them hidden until SEELE brought along the first of the colony ships.  
另一方面，他将失去另一台 EVA。他已经失去了真嗣，再失去一台将对事业造成沉重打击。其余成员已经变得不安，他需要让他们保持隐蔽，直到 SEELE 带来第一艘殖民船。

"Agent Sohryu, do you truly believe you are capable of handling this?"  
"草薙特工，你真的认为自己能处理这件事吗？"

Asuka smirked arrogantly at Gendo's question, "Of course I'm capable, I'm the best person for this job and you know it. Just tell me what I need to do."  
明日香对源堂的问题傲慢地笑了笑，"当然可以，我是这项工作的最佳人选，你心里有数。告诉我需要做什么就行了。"

Fuyutsuki glanced across at the director, wondering just what he was playing at.  
冬月瞥了一眼指挥官，不知道他在打什么算盘。

_'What is he doing? SEELE will find out and kill her the minute they learn she is there. He can't let this happen to her, she's still human.'  
“他在做什么？SEELE 一旦发现她在那里，会立刻杀了她。他不能让这种事发生在她身上，她还是人类。”_

Gendo nodded. This was against his better judgement, but given the options he could find no better choice, "Fine, you shall accompany Rei and Agent Kaji to the facility. Once there you will attempt to infiltrate the facility. SEELE have long since cut off contact from me so I do not know what is there. However, it is likely you will encounter an Angel there."  
碇点点头。这违背了他的直觉，但考虑到现有的选择，他找不到更好的办法，“好吧，你将陪同绫波和特工加持前往设施。一旦到达那里，你们将尝试潜入。SEELE 早已切断了与我的联系，所以我不知道那里有什么。然而，你们很可能会在那里遇到使徒。”

Misato leapt up from her seat, apparently unhappy at Gendo's decision. She didn't want to see Asuka unhappy, but she'd rather have that than seeing her dead, "What are you playing at? I thought we all agreed it was too dangerous for her. We can't send her in."  
美里从座位上跳了起来，显然对碇的决定感到不满。她不想看到明日香不开心，但她更不想看到她死去，“你在玩什么把戏？我们不是都同意对她来说太危险了吗。我们不能派她进去。”

Asuka turned to her, "I can handle myself Misato, I'm not a child."  
明日香转向她，“我能照顾自己，美里，我不是小孩子。”

"You have only been out of the hospital for two weeks Asuka, how can you even consider going back there. Is it revenge on them you want?"  
“你才出院两周，明日香，你怎么能考虑再回去？你是想报复他们吗？”

"Yes I want revenge Misato, because of what they fucking did to me. Because of what they did to all of us. I'm not going to fail nor am I going to die. Thank you for your concern, but as far as I'm concerned you can save it for someone else who needs it."  
“是的，我想要报复，美里，因为他们对我所做的一切。因为他们对我们所有人所做的一切。我不会失败，也不会死去。谢谢你的关心，但就我而言，你可以把这份关心留给更需要的人。”

Asuka got up from her seat and stormed out of the room, leaving the rest of them sitting in silence. Misato got up, ready to go after her, but Kaji stopped her, "Leave it for now Misato, let her be alone for a few moments."  
明日香从座位上站起身，怒气冲冲地离开了房间，留下其他人坐在沉默中。美里站了起来，准备追上去，但加持拦住了她，“现在先别管她，美里，让她一个人静一静。”

"I shall go and see her." All the people in the room looked to the source of the voice with slight shock. Rei had been silent for the entire meeting, only offering slight input when asked to confirm something.  
“我去看看她。”房间里的人都略带惊讶地看向声音的来源。绫波在整个会议中一直保持沉默，只有在被要求确认某事时才稍作回应。

Rei left the room, leaving the rest of them to plan the details. Misato quickly moved to voice her concern, "I can't believe we're going to let her do this. It's a suicide mission."  
绫波离开了房间，留下其他人继续商讨细节。美里迅速表达了自己的担忧，“我真不敢相信我们会让她们这么做。这简直是自杀任务。”

Kaji placed his hand on her shoulder, trying to calm her down. He wished Misato wouldn't come to these meetings. Especially in the condition she was in, all she had done in the past few weeks was worry about Asuka or Shinji when she should be thinking about other things. This wasn't right, she was pregnant, she should be relaxing and not having to deal with this.  
加持将手放在她的肩上，试图让她平静下来。他希望美里不要参加这些会议。尤其是她现在的状态，过去几周她一直在担心明日香或真嗣，而她本该考虑其他事情。这不合适，她怀孕了，应该放松而不是处理这些。

He voiced his own opinion, "Is there any way we can send Sohryu on this mission without causing further risk to her?"  
他表达了自己的看法，“有没有办法让惣流执行这次任务而不增加她的风险？”

Gendo shook his head, "No, I'm afraid not. She's a time bomb as it is. The implant SEELE put into her means we cannot do much."  
碇源堂摇了摇头，“不，恐怕不行。她本身就是个定时炸弹。SEELE 植入她体内的装置意味着我们无法采取太多措施。”

Misato looked up, "Implant?"  
美里抬头问道：“植入物？”

Fuyutsuki nodded, "Yes, she has been fitted with some type of implant. That is why she is suffering the hallucinations. We cannot however inform her about this because it is our belief that if she becomes aware of it and attempts to have it removed SEELE will use it to kill her."  
冬月点头道：“是的，她被植入了某种装置。这就是她产生幻觉的原因。但我们不能告诉她这一点，因为我们认为如果她意识到并试图移除它，SEELE 会利用它来杀死她。”

Misato looked on in shock. So this was why they were willing to let her go. Either way she was going to die it seemed. "You mean she's going to die either way?"  
美里震惊地看着。原来这就是他们愿意放她走的原因。无论怎样，她似乎都难逃一死。“你是说她无论如何都会死？”

Gendo quickly answered her, "No, not unless we can find a way to remove the implant safely. We believe that it is being controlled from the Island facility. If we can find a way to remove the people controlling it then it will be easy to remove. However, the moment SEELE learns any of us are there they will probably move to kill her."  
源度迅速回答她，“不，除非我们能找到安全移除植入物的方法。我们相信它正受到岛屿设施的控制。如果能找到控制它的人并移除，那么移除植入物就会变得简单。然而，一旦 Seele 得知我们在那里，他们很可能会采取行动杀死她。”

_Sometime in 2018 2018 年某时_

**Tokyo 3 Ruins 第三新东京市废墟  
**Asuka quickly ducked into the small shelter and looked around. It was getting dark, soon the patrols would be out and looking for her again. She had to find him quickly and get him back to the camp before that happened. She slowly peeked around the corner, trying to find any signs of life. She couldn't see anything, but she knew they were out there. One of them had seen her, she only hoped the others were safe.  
明日香迅速躲进那个小掩体，环顾四周。天色渐暗，巡逻队很快就会出动，再次搜寻她。她必须尽快找到他，带他回到营地，以免被发现。她缓缓探头望向拐角，试图发现任何生命迹象。她什么也没看到，但她知道他们就在那里。其中一人已经看到了她，她只希望其他人能安全。

She prepared herself to leave the hiding spot, when just at that moment she heard and saw a large explosion from the other end of the city. She watched the cloud of smoke and debris go up into the air.  
她正准备离开藏身之处，就在这时，她听到并看到了城市另一端发生的大爆炸。她注视着烟尘和碎片腾空而起。

_'Damn it, now they're going to send the scouting groups out earlier.'  
'该死，现在他们要提前派出侦察队了。'_

Three years it had been like this, three years since they arrived and the resistance made their presence known. Asuka couldn't help but feel like they were fighting a losing battle, their only hope was the child or in his rescue and Asuka didn't like the idea of placing all the worlds hope in the hands of a small child.  
这样的日子已经持续了三年，自从他们抵达并宣告抵抗组织的存在以来。明日香不禁觉得他们正在打一场注定失败的战斗，他们唯一的希望寄托在一个孩子身上，或是他的救援行动上，而明日香并不喜欢将整个世界的希望都放在一个小孩子手中的想法。

_'Especially considering the parents.'  
'尤其是考虑到他的父母。'_

She continued watching as a group of scouts walked past her hiding spot. She shivered, looking at their cybernetic bodies. It was so inhuman, like something from a nightmare. She caught a glimpse of one of their faces. She recognised him, he had been a member of the resistance up until a few weeks ago until he was captured.  
她继续观察着，一队侦察兵从她的藏身之处走过。她颤抖着，看着他们那机械化的身体。这太不人道了，就像是从噩梦中走出来的东西。她瞥见其中一个人的脸。她认出了他，他曾是抵抗组织的一员，直到几周前被捕。

It was a fate worse than death. Asuka apologized to him silently as she stepped out from the hiding place and aimed two carefully placed shots in the backs of their heads, killing them instantly. That was probably one of the only good things about the drones, their lack of an A.T. Field made it easier to kill them. They were slaves, puppets controlled by the higher forces. Only used because of the overwhelming amount of them.  
这比死还惨。明日香默默地向他道歉，从藏身处走出来，对准他们的后脑勺精准地开了两枪，瞬间将他们击毙。这大概是无人机为数不多的好处之一，它们缺乏 A.T.力场，使得击杀变得更容易。它们是奴隶，被更高力量操控的傀儡。仅仅因为数量庞大而被利用。

She continued moving along the street, being extra careful not to run into any more patrols. So far she had only seen scouts, but they would be sending out the controllers soon. Then she would have more trouble, she would have to switch ammunition and she would have to deal with their A.T. Fields.  
她继续沿着街道前行，格外小心避免遭遇更多巡逻队。到目前为止，她只看到了侦察兵，但控制者们很快就会被派遣出来。那时她将面临更多麻烦，她需要更换弹药，并且要应对它们的 A.T.力场。

She pressed herself up against the wall and looked around carefully. The prison block was up ahead. It was low security, not so much a prison as a slum area. Anyone captured was sent there, awaiting harvesting. Then they would become drones. That was if they survived their time there. Some people weren't harvested, gangs controlled the streets here. They were given the area in exchange for a promise that as long as they stuck to that area they would not be harvested. It was a good deal, they had power and kept their lives.  
她紧贴着墙壁，小心翼翼地环顾四周。前方就是监狱区。这里安保松懈，与其说是监狱，不如说是个贫民窟。任何被捕的人都会被送到这里，等待被收割。之后他们就会变成无人机。前提是他们能熬过那段时间。有些人并未被收割，街头帮派控制着这片区域。他们用这片区域的控制权换取了一个承诺：只要他们不越界，就不会被收割。这是个不错的交易，他们拥有权力，也保住了性命。

Her own prize was in there though. She could find him there, if the information was accurate he was being held by one of the gangs. If she could secure him it could deal a serious blow to them, the aliens, and cause a great boost to the resistance.  
不过，她的目标就在那里。如果情报准确，他正被某个帮派囚禁。如果她能救出他，将对那些外星人造成沉重打击，并为抵抗力量带来巨大的鼓舞。

She moved into the streets, blending in easily. If you had a gun you were immediately thought of as being in a gang. They would leave you alone then, if you had an assault rifle you were thought of as being a commander in a gang. Then they would definitely leave you alone. Luckily for Asuka, she happened to have both. All she had to worry about now was one of the residents trying to take her out.  
她步入街道，轻松融入其中。如果你带着枪，立刻就会被认为是帮派成员。他们会对你敬而远之，如果你持有突击步枪，则会被视为帮派指挥官。那样他们绝对不敢招惹你。幸运的是，明日香恰好两者兼备。现在她唯一需要担心的是，某个居民试图对她下手。

She felt a faint rumbling sound beneath her and looked up. There was another explosion, only this time it was a lot closer. People around her quickly got up and began rushing away from the explosion. Soon there was a sea of people pushing against her. Was there this many people before? No, there couldn't have been.  
她感到脚下传来一阵微弱的震动声，抬头一看。又是一次爆炸，只是这次近得多。周围的人迅速起身，开始逃离爆炸地点。很快，她被人群的浪潮推挤着。之前有这么多人吗？不，不可能有。

"Let me past, come on."  
“让我过去，快点。”

They ignored her and kept pushing her back as there was another explosion. She screamed out as she felt herself being swept back with an even greater force. But not because of the people, because she could see him. He was there in front of her, only she couldn't move.  
他们无视她，继续将她往后推，因为又是一次爆炸。她尖叫起来，感觉自己被一股更强大的力量卷走。但这不是因为人群，而是因为她看到了他。他就站在她面前，只是她动弹不得。

"Shinji! Please turn around, you've got to come with me!"  
"真嗣！请转身，你必须跟我走！"

It was no use, he couldn't hear her. She felt herself get swept away with the crowd as she got one final gaze at him.  
没用的，他听不见她。她感到自己被人群卷走，最后再看他一眼。

_30__th_ _October 2015_ 2015 年 10 月 30 日

**Asuka's Residence – 0540 hours  
明日香的家 —— 0540 时**

Her eyes opened slowly as she found herself once again on her sofa downstairs. On the TV some early morning news show had started up. That was all a dream? The Resistance, the ruins, the explosions, it was all just a dream?  
她的眼睛缓缓睁开，发现自己又一次躺在楼下的沙发上。电视上，某个早间新闻节目已经开始了。这一切都是梦吗？抵抗组织、废墟、爆炸，这一切都只是梦吗？

She groaned and sat up, _'Just what I need before we go to Marduk, at least this time it wasn't a nightmare.'_  
她呻吟着坐起身，‘在我们去马杜克之前，至少这次不是噩梦。’

She looked at the time on the TV Screen. It would only be a few hours until they would be dropped onto the island. She had to get ready for it and prepare herself, if she messed up this time she knew there would be no second chance.  
她看了看电视屏幕上的时间，再过几个小时他们就要被空投到岛上了。她必须为此做好准备，如果这次搞砸了，她知道不会有第二次机会。

**Marduk Island Facility – 1300 hours  
马尔杜克岛设施 —— 1300 小时**

Asuka stood up and took her parachute off, her stomach still turning over from the experience. Parachuting onto the island was an experience she didn't want to remember. She looked around, looking out for the signal. After a few moments it came, short bursts of a flash light that meant they were all right to meet up and plan their next move.  
明日香站起身，脱下降落伞，胃里仍因刚才的经历翻江倒海。空降到岛上的经历她不愿再回想。她环顾四周，寻找信号。片刻后，信号出现了，手电筒短促的闪光意味着他们可以集合并计划下一步行动。

A chill ran down her spine as she went to meet with Kaji and Ayanami. The last time she had been on this island she had suffered complete humiliation. Her entire mind had been shown on a screen and played back to her. She wanted to ensure that this time she would not be humiliated. She checked her clock. Just as expected, it was the right time. She had to wonder just why it was so dark here. They hadn't travelled that far from Japan, had they?  
她去见加持和绫波时，脊背一阵发凉。上次她在这岛上遭受了彻底的羞辱。她的整个心智被展示在屏幕上，回放给她看。她想确保这次不会再次受辱。她看了看表。正如所料，正是时候。她不禁疑惑，为何这里如此昏暗。他们并没有离日本太远，不是吗？

She eventually came to the small clearing where Ayanami and Kaji had already met up. She nodded at them and made her way over to them, taking her backpack off and taking the map of the island out.  
她最终来到了绫波和加持已经会合的小空地。她向他们点头示意，走过去，卸下背包，拿出岛屿的地图。

"Okay, so what now? We should have landed pretty close to the facility, but we can't just go through the front door."  
“好吧，接下来怎么办？我们应该降落在设施附近，但不能直接从前门进去。”

Rei nodded, "Agreed, we need to find some other way in and then signal Katsuragi to begin the countdown."  
丽点点头，“同意，我们需要找到其他进入的方法，然后通知葛城开始倒计时。”

Asuka looked at the map. The facility had been marked on it but, unfortunately, it was nothing more than a guess. Her concentration was interrupted when she heard Kaji cursing as he took out the radio equipment. He turned to them both and spoke his voice solemn.  
明日香看着地图。设施已经被标记在上面，但不幸的是，这仅仅是一个猜测。她的专注被一阵咒骂声打断，那是加持在拆除无线电设备时发出的。他转向她们两人，语气沉重地说道。

"They've got something set up here. They're probably blocking all radio facilities from the facility itself. Our short range radios should work but we can't transmit off the island."  
“他们在这里设了什么东西。很可能是在设施内部屏蔽了所有无线电设施。我们的短程无线电应该还能用，但我们无法从岛上发送信号。”

"Can you get it working?" Asuka enquired.  
"你能修好吗？" 明日香询问道。

He nodded, "If you and Ayanami can stop what's blocking the equipment then yes, easily."  
他点点头，"如果你和绫波能解决阻碍设备的问题，那么是的，很容易。"

"Good, you should stay and look after the equipment. We'll radio you when we find out what's blocking the signals."  
"好，你留下来照看设备。我们找到信号被阻的原因后会用无线电联系你。"

Asuka folded up the map and looked towards the jungle. According to their information and if they landed in the right place it should only be an hour or so to the facility. They also had the fact that it was dark on their side. That would make it significantly easier to get there. Next to her she saw Rei producing her pistol and the special ammunition they had been given.  
明日香折起地图，望向丛林。根据他们掌握的信息，如果降落在正确位置，到达设施应该只需一小时左右。此外，夜色也是他们的有利条件，这将大大降低行进的难度。她身旁的绫波零正在组装她的手枪和特制弹药。

"They will probably have patrols out and potentially have set up traps in the area. We should be weary of this."  
“他们可能会有巡逻队，甚至可能在区域内设置了陷阱。我们必须对此保持警惕。”

Asuka nodded, "Right. Well, let's get going."  
明日香点头道：“对。那我们出发吧。”

**Nearby Platform – 1315 hours  
附近平台 —— 1315 时**

Misato looked at the screen and adjusted her headset slightly. They should have made it onto the island by now. They should have radioed to say they were there and heading towards the facility, so why hadn't they? The atmosphere inside the small room was incredibly tense, even the director, a man she had quickly learnt never let his emotion be shown looked to be incredibly nervous.  
美里看着屏幕，轻轻调整了一下耳机。他们现在应该已经登上岛了。他们应该已经通过无线电报告他们到了，正朝设施前进，但为什么还没有呢？这个小房间里的气氛异常紧张，甚至连她迅速了解到从不表露情绪的导演，看起来也异常紧张。

Misato tried to calm herself down, there was probably a good reason why there had been no contact yet. She just wish she knew it. Thankfully, Fuyutsuki had a good theory of his own.  
美里试图让自己冷静下来，可能还没有联系是有合理原因的。她只是希望自己知道这个原因。幸运的是，冬月有自己的一个好理论。

"They'll probably have something set up to block outgoing signals. They'll have been expecting us to return."  
"他们可能会设置一些障碍来阻止信号外传。他们肯定预料到我们会回来。"

Gendo spoke, "Agreed, I have already informed Rei of what to do in this situation. It should only be a matter of time until we have established contact with her."  
碇源堂开口道：“同意，我已经通知绫波在这种情况下该怎么做。应该用不了多久我们就能与她取得联系。”

**Marduk Island Facility – 1400 hours  
马杜克岛设施 – 1400 时**

They had been walking for one hour and there had been nothing. No facility, no patrols and no traps. Asuka was beginning to wonder if they were even on the correct island. In front of her she saw Rei stop and look around, she too wondering just where they had gone wrong.  
他们已经走了一个小时，却什么也没遇到。没有设施，没有巡逻队，也没有陷阱。明日香开始怀疑他们是否找对了岛屿。在她前面，她看到绫波停下脚步，环顾四周，同样在思考他们究竟哪里出了错。

"This is unusual, the facility should be in front of us. We must have planned the wrong route."  
“这很不寻常，设施应该就在我们面前。我们一定是规划错了路线。”

Asuka sighed and leant against one of the trees, her feet killing her from walking non stop for an hour and the sweat dripping down her face. She took one of the bottles of water out of her bag and threw it over to Rei, also taking one out for herself. "Brilliant news, how can we have planned the wrong route though? By what you guys saw last time the facility covered half the island."  
明日香叹了口气，靠在一棵树上，连续走了一个小时，她的脚疼得要命，汗水顺着脸颊滴落。她从背包里拿出一瓶水扔给绫波，也给自己拿了一瓶。“好消息真棒，但我们怎么会规划错了路线呢？根据你们上次看到的，设施几乎覆盖了半个岛屿。”

"That is correct, that is why I am finding this unusual."  
"那是正确的，这就是我觉得这很反常的原因。"

"So we're lost then, well that's brillia-"  
"所以我们迷路了，好吧，这真是太棒了——"

Asuka was cut off as she felt a sharp pain cut through her head. She brought her hand up to clutch her head as it shot through her again.  
明日香的话被突然袭来的剧痛打断。她抬起手紧抱住头，疼痛再次如刀割般贯穿她的脑袋。

_'Not now, any other time but not now.'  
'现在不行，任何时候都可以，除了现在。'_

She looked up and stopped herself from screaming out at the sight she saw behind Rei. He was there only he was...he was dead, hanging from one of the trees. Shinji was there, only a matter of metres in front of her. Had they found him, no they couldn't have done. Shinji was alive and she knew it, it was just another illusion, a sickening hallucination.  
她抬头一看，差点尖叫出声，只见丽身后出现了他，只是他已经...死了，挂在其中一棵树上。真嗣就在那里，距离她不过几米远。他们找到他了吗？不，他们不可能找到。真嗣还活着，她心里清楚，这只是另一个幻觉，一个令人作呕的幻象。

Asuka tried to move to cover her eyes but found herself unable to move, unable to do anything, she couldn't even scream out. Out of the corner of her eye she saw a faint movement, was someone there?  
明日香试图移动双手遮住眼睛，却发现动弹不得，什么都做不了，甚至连尖叫都做不到。眼角余光瞥见一丝微弱的动静，那里有人吗？

Rei stood motionless, her eyes transfixed on Asuka, who wasn't moving. She was fixed on something beyond Rei, something that wasn't there.  
丽静静地站着，目光紧锁在不动的明日香身上。她的视线停留在丽身后某个不存在的东西上。

_'They know we're here, they're going to kill he-'  
'他们知道我们在这里，他们会杀了我们——'_

Her thoughts were interrupted as she saw something rustling out of the corner of her eye. She turned and saw the faint traces of an A.T. Field. She withdrew her gun and aimed it at the source of the field, only to feel someone pressing the cold steel of a pistol into the back of her neck.  
她的思绪被眼角瞥见的一阵窸窣声打断。她转身，看到了一个 A.T.力场的微弱痕迹。她拔出手枪，瞄准力场的源头，却感到有人将冰冷的枪管抵在了她的后颈上。

"Don't even try to use your A.T. Field here. We have more than enough of the same ammunition you're currently using and unless you want to see your friend die in front of you I wouldn't suggest trying to fight back either."  
"在这里别想用你的 A.T.力场。我们拥有的弹药比你现在用的还多，除非你想亲眼看着你的朋友死在你面前，否则我建议你也不要试图反抗。"

It was a woman's voice. Rei tried to turn to see who was speaking, only to feel the person pressing the gun against her even more. The woman spoke again, "Don't worry, your friend has only been put into a temporary state of shock, she isn't dead yet. She'll just be catatonic for a while whilst we run some more tests on her. You, however, we have something very special planned for you."  
那是一个女人的声音。绫试图转身看看是谁在说话，却感觉到那人将枪更加用力地抵在她身上。女人再次开口，"别担心，你的朋友只是暂时处于震惊状态，她还没死。她会暂时陷入木僵状态，而我们会对她进行更多测试。至于你，我们为你准备了一些非常特别的东西。"

With those words Rei saw another person stepping out of the jungle and moving towards her. How many people were there? Had they been following them all that time or was this just coincidence? She felt the person lift her arm up and inject something into her, the last words she heard before she fell into unconsciousness was the woman speaking again.  
说完这些话，绫看到另一个人从丛林中走出，向她走来。有多少人？他们是一直跟踪他们还是仅仅是巧合？她感觉到那人抬起她的手臂，给她注射了什么，她在昏迷前听到的最后一句话是那个女人再次说话的声音。

"Prepare her for core extraction, we want to find out how Gendo was able to create this."  
准备进行核心提取，我们要查明碇是怎么创造出这个的。

### Chapter 27 Wearing The Inside Out

_30th_ _October 2015_ 2015 年 10 月 30 日

**Nearby Platform – 1500 hours  
附近站台 – 15:00**

Misato looked on tensely, there was still no signal from them, she couldn't help but fear the worst. Something must have gone wrong in the time they had been there, she could sense it. She was alone in the radio room, Fuyutsuki and Gendo having left a while ago to look for any signal from the island.  
美里紧张地注视着，依然没有他们的信号，她不禁担心最坏的情况。在他们待在那里的这段时间里，一定出了什么问题，她能感觉到。她独自一人在无线电室，冬月和源堂早已离开去寻找来自岛上的任何信号。

She took her headset off and watched the screen, looking for any signs of an incoming communication. Still nothing. For nearly two hours she had been sitting in this floating platform, worried out of her mind. She looked down at herself, at the small bump that was beginning to show. No one could know how the baby would grow up, Misato could slowly begin to feel herself losing her sanity as it all began to catch up with her.  
她摘下耳机，盯着屏幕，寻找任何即将到来的通讯迹象。依然什么都没有。近两个小时，她一直坐在这个漂浮平台上，担心得要命。她低头看着自己，看着那逐渐显现的小隆起。没人能知道这个孩子将如何成长，美里慢慢开始感到自己正逐渐失去理智，这一切开始追上了她。

A faint beeping noise came from the machine in front of her. She quickly jumped forward and put the headset on. Finally, this was it, they had been able to do it they had gotten communications back. She spoke into the headset frantically, "Asuka, Rei are you two alright? Did everything go fine?"  
她面前的机器传来微弱的哔哔声。她迅速向前跳起，戴上耳机。终于，就是这样，他们成功了，他们恢复了通讯。她急切地对着耳机说：“明日香，丽，你们俩还好吗？一切顺利吗？”

The voice that replied however was not the one that she expected, "Close Misato, but not quite. I'm approaching the platform now, make sure all three of you are there, okay?"  
然而，回应的声音并非她所预期的，“接近了，美里，但还不够准确。我现在正接近站台，确保你们三个人都在那里，好吗？”

They were approaching, that meant they were successful. She sighed in relief and exited the room after hearing Kaji's words. Maybe there was still some hope for them after all. She made her way out to the main platform where she saw Fuyutsuki and Gendo helping Kaji up onto the platform. There was just one problem, Asuka and Rei were not with him. Nor was any of the equipment or weapons Kaji had been given.  
他们正在接近，这意味着他们成功了。听到加持的话，她松了一口气，离开了房间。也许他们终究还有一些希望。她走向主站台，看到副司令和总司令正在帮助加持登上站台。但有一个问题，明日香和绫波并不在他身边。他也没有携带任何装备或武器。

She stepped forward, "Kaji, what…why are you alone?"  
她走上前去，“加持，怎么……为什么你一个人？”

He turned to face her. There was no smile on his face as usual, no attempt to reassure her. He dashed forward and wrapped his arms around her apologizing to her. "I'm so sorry Misato, there was nothing I could do."  
他转过身面对她。脸上没有像往常那样露出笑容，也没有试图安慰她。他冲上前去，紧紧抱住她，向她道歉。“真嗣，对不起，美里，我无能为力。”

The words hit her like a freight train. Did that mean that that Asuka and Rei didn't make it? That couldn't have been it though, if that was the case then why would they let Kaji go? Surely they would have killed everyone.  
这些话如同一列货运列车般重重地撞击在她心头。这是否意味着明日香和绫波没有成功？但这不可能，如果真是那样，他们为何会让加持离开？他们肯定会把所有人都杀掉。

Gendo looked out towards the island, the realization that Asuka and Rei had been taken just hitting him. It had been a trap, they should have known. Marduk were prepared for them, just as they were prepared when Asuka and Rei infiltrated Marduk's headquarters and he had walked right into it. He had handed over the remaining Evangelions and, more importantly, humanities hope to stop SEELE. He questioned Kaji, his own voice not betraying the emotion he felt.  
碇源堂望向那座岛屿，意识到明日香和绫波已被带走的事实刚刚击中了他。这本是一个陷阱，他们早该料到。马尔杜克组织对他们了如指掌，正如当初明日香和绫波潜入马尔杜克总部时一样，而他就这样直接踏入了圈套。他交出了剩余的福音战士，更重要的是，交出了人类阻止 Seele 的希望。他质问加持，自己的声音并未泄露内心的情感。

"Agent Kaji, what happened?"  
“加持先生，发生了什么？”

"They were waiting for us, Armisael and a number of the Aliens themselves. It looks like SEELE are using the remaining Angels against us. They've manipulated the angels into it. It's possible that Nagisa is an Angel as well."  
“他们在等我们，阿米沙尔和一些使徒本身。看来 SEELE 正在利用剩余的使徒对付我们。他们操纵使徒参与其中。长良滨可能也是使徒。”

Gendo nodded, "I see, what happened when you got to the island?"  
碇点点头，“我明白了，你们到达岛上时发生了什么？”

"We landed as expected and found out that the communications were out. Asuka and Rei set out to infiltrate the facility and try to find out what was blocking the signal, they told me to stay behind to work on the communications devices. About an hour later I was ambushed. There were about twelve people surrounding me and then Armisael herself stepped out."  
"我们如期降落，发现通讯已经中断。明日香和绫波零出发潜入设施，试图查明信号被阻断的原因，她们让我留在原地修理通讯设备。大约一小时后，我遭到了伏击。大约有十二个人围住了我，随后亚尔玛赛尔本人走了出来。"

"Who were the people?" "那些人是谁？"

"They weren't human, I can tell you that much. As for why they were working with an Angel, I don't know. I always thought they feared the Angels."  
"他们不是人类，这点我可以肯定。至于他们为何与使徒合作，我不清楚。我一直以为他们害怕使徒。"

Gendo clenched his hand into a fist and unclenched it, a nervous habit of his he had not exhibited since before the impact. The Angels and the Aliens working together, SEELE would never permit such a thing. It would only complicate matters, but it was happening nonetheless. Did this mean that their arrival would come much sooner then the December 30th date set?  
源堂紧握拳头又松开，这是他自冲击前就未曾显露的紧张习惯。使徒与外星人联手，Seele 绝不会允许这种事发生。这只会让事情变得更复杂，但无论如何，它正在发生。这是否意味着他们的到来会比原定的 12 月 30 日提前许多？

He continued questioning Kaji, "What happened after that?"  
他继续追问加持，“那之后发生了什么？”

"She informed me that she had the remaining Evangelions and that she would spare their lives if I left and passed on a message to you."  
“她告诉我她掌握了剩余的 EVA，并表示只要我离开并给你带个口信，她就会饶他们一命。”

Gendo nodded, "What message?"  
源度点头，“什么消息？”

"Not to return, or they will kill both Rei and Asuka. She said that they can extract Rei's core whether or not she is dead..."  
“不要回来，否则他们会杀死丽和明日香。她说，无论丽是否活着，他们都能提取她的核心……”

Misato raised her head, not sure what that even meant, "Rei's core?"  
美里抬起头，不太明白那是什么意思，“丽的核心？”

Gendo turned to face them and removed his glasses. For the first time, she could actually see his eyes. They looked very much like Shinji's, of course they were older and maybe a bit wiser but the similarities between the two were astounding. Gendo looked up towards the sky and replied, "We leave here immediately. If they are trying to extract Rei's core then this is graver than expected. I did not think they would try to do such a thing.  
"源堂转过身来面对他们，摘下了眼镜。这是她第一次真正看到他的眼睛。它们看起来非常像真嗣的，当然，它们更年长，或许也更睿智，但这两者之间的相似之处令人惊叹。源堂抬头望向天空，回答道：“我们立刻离开这里。如果他们试图提取丽的核心，那么情况比预期的更为严重。我没想到他们会尝试这样做。”

**SEELE's Domain – Time Unknown  
Seele 的领域 – 时间未知**

Keel sat at the end of the table with a proud smile on his face, and after all why shouldn't he be proud? More than thirty years had gone into this since the discovery of those ships and every stage had been planned out in great detail. First contact with the aliens, locating and extracting the DNA of the being known as Adam, the Angel Project and then the Impact Incident itself. So many people had been sacrificed, so much time money and effort had gone into it and now it was beginning to pay off.  
基尔坐在桌子的尽头，脸上带着自豪的微笑，毕竟他为何不应该自豪呢？自从发现那些飞船以来，已经过去了三十多年，每一个阶段都经过了精心策划。首先是与外星人的第一次接触，定位并提取被称为亚当的存在的 DNA，天使计划，然后是冲击事件本身。如此多的人被牺牲，如此多的时间、金钱和精力被投入其中，而现在这一切开始得到回报。

He looked around, ready to make his announcement. He had to wonder how the other members of the committee would take it. They each represented different governments or corporations, all of them huge players in the global market. Most of the world's super powers were represented by certain public officials or men like Keel who preferred to work outside of the public eye.  
他环顾四周，准备宣布自己的决定。他不禁好奇委员会的其他成员会如何反应。他们各自代表不同的政府或企业，都是全球市场中的巨头。世界上大多数超级大国都由某些公职人员或像基尔这样偏好幕后工作的人代表。

They would probably disagree with him at first, he thought to himself, but they would see the light. He had already made preparations in case once of them were to disagree. He reached into his jacket pocket and felt the handgun there, loaded with ammunition from the Lance. Of course he had to be prepared for that as well. Keel knew about people, he knew what made them tick and how to manipulate them. Any one of those people on the committee could be working with their own agenda much like him or they could even have gone as far as to work with Gendo Ikari.  
他暗自思忖，他们可能会先反对他，但最终会明白他的用意。他已经做好了准备，以防有人不同意。他伸手摸了摸夹克口袋里的手枪，里面装着来自朗斯的弹药。当然，他也必须为此做好准备。基尔了解人，知道他们的动机和如何操纵他们。委员会中的任何一个人都可能像他一样有自己的议程，甚至可能与碇源堂合作。

He smiled at how ironic that would be, the fifteen year war of minds between him and Gendo ended because someone else here had been working secretly all this time. They would both lose and then who knows what would happen. Gendo wanted to 'save the world', Keel wanted to be around to watch it transform into a new world, his idealistic vision, and become its God.  
他笑了，这将是多么讽刺的一幕，他与碇源堂之间长达十五年的心智之战，竟因这里有人暗中策划而告终。他们都将失败，然后谁知道会发生什么。碇源堂想要‘拯救世界’，基尔则希望亲眼见证它转变为新世界，他理想中的景象，并成为那里的神。

The doors to the chamber closed and locked them in. This was a special building built thirty years ago a few miles away from the sight that would become Tokyo 3. It was meant to be a safe house, a place to house SEELE and convert them into the rulers they were prophesised to be. Prophesised to rule over humanity and share equal power when it ascended to its next state of being.  
会议室的门关闭并锁上了。这是一座三十年前在距离未来东京 3 所在地几英里处建造的特殊建筑。它本应是一个安全屋，一个用来安置 SEELE 并让他们转变为预言中统治者的地方。预言他们将统治人类，并在人类进化到下一阶段时分享同等权力。

He stood up as the main overhead lights went on, illuminating the room. As he stood he took a look around at the room that had been build for them, the room itself was an interesting design. A mixture of influences in the chamber from Earth's early cultures. This particular chamber was mostly Egyptian, one of the first cultures to make contact with the alien beings and those who had the honour of being amongst the first beings to be harvested.  
当他站起来时，主照明灯亮起，照亮了整个房间。他环顾四周，这个为他们而建的房间设计颇为有趣，融合了地球早期文化的多种影响。这个特定的房间主要是埃及风格，是最早与外星生命接触的文化之一，也是第一批有幸被收割的生物。

"Gentlemen welcome, I am sure you are all aware why we are here. The bells have sounded and soon we shall take our rightful place in this brave new world."  
“先生们，欢迎光临，想必各位都清楚我们为何聚集于此。钟声已响，不久我们将在这崭新的世界中占据我们应有的位置。”

The reaction, as he had expected, was not overly positive, of course that was understandable. They were not meant to convene like this until the thirtieth of December. That was two months away. One of them spoke up almost immediately.  
正如他所预料的，反应并不十分积极，当然这是可以理解的。他们原本不打算在 12 月 30 日之前召开这样的会议。那还有两个月的时间。其中一位几乎立刻开口了。

"I presume you have a good reason for keeping us held up here Keel, this was not due until two months from now. Why did we not just call another meeting and why are we here when there are two Angels remaining?"  
“基尔，我想你一定有充分的理由让我们提前聚集在这里，这本应是两个月后的事。为何我们不干脆另定一个会议，而且现在还有两位天使尚未到场，我们为何要提前来此？”

Keel stood and smiled at his comrade. He pressed a button on his desk and a screen opened up at the centre of the table. It was a star map showing the location of several ships and a location marked Earth.  
基尔站起身，向他的战友微笑。他按下桌上的一个按钮，屏幕在桌子中央展开。这是一张星图，显示了几艘船只的位置和一个标记为地球的地点。

"There are explanations for both, as you can see the schedule has been accelerated. We simply have no more reason to wait any longer, both Angels can be dealt with swiftly and firmly. Tabris will willingly sacrifice himself for our cause and Armiseal will be dealt with in the next few days. I shall personally see to it that Gendo Ikari himself is present at both executions. After all, we also have all three Evangelions under our control."  
“正如你所见，计划已经加速。我们没有理由再等待，两台使徒可以迅速而果断地处理。塔布里斯会自愿为我们的目标牺牲，而亚米西尔将在接下来的几天内被解决。我将亲自确保碇源堂本人出席这两场处决。毕竟，我们已完全控制了三台福音战士。”

One of the other members of the committee stood up angrily and started speaking, "On whose authority was all this done Keel? We agreed to not interfere. You lied to the committee, something which you know is punishable by death."  
委员会的另一名成员愤怒地站起来开始发言：“基尔，这一切是根据谁的授权进行的？我们同意不干涉。你向委员会撒了谎，你知道这是死罪。”

"On my authority." “以我的权威。”

This was the moment Keel had been waiting for, the moment to assert himself as the true leader, to let them all know what would happen to those that challenged him. He took out the hand gun and promptly shot the person who challenged him directly in the heart. The person attempted to produce an A.T. Field but the bullet ripped straight through it like it was nothing.  
这正是基尔期待已久的时刻，展现他作为真正领袖的权威，让所有人明白挑战他的下场。他掏出手枪，果断地朝挑战者的心脏开了一枪。那人试图生成 AT 力场，但子弹如同穿透虚无般径直穿透了它。

The other members looked on in shock, none of them daring to move after what they had witnessed. Just as Keel had suspected someone would attempt to overthrow him, it was a good thing he was prepared for it.  
其他成员惊恐地看着这一幕，没有人敢动弹。正如基尔所料，有人试图推翻他，幸好他早有准备。

Two guards came into the room and picked up the dying man, dragging him out of the room. The rest of the committee simply watched in silence as he was dragged away.  
两名守卫走进房间，抬起那个垂死的人，将他拖了出去。委员会的其他成员只是默默地看着他被拖走。

"Just as I expected, this is why I accelerated the schedule, to ensure that we still succeed. If we had waited then who knows what would have happened? We have already had to contend with Gendo Ikari's futile plans and now one of our own injected himself with the serum in an attempt to betray us.  
“正如我所料，这就是我加速计划的原因，确保我们仍能成功。如果我们再等下去，谁知道会发生什么？我们已经不得不应对碇源堂那些徒劳的计划，现在我们自己人还注射了血清试图背叛我们。”

One of the other representatives spoke, "My government will not be pleased with this Keel. They expected more warning to prepare people for the harvesting. This will complicate matters, they will attempt to withdraw and declare war."  
另一位代表开口道：“我的政府不会对此感到高兴，基尔。他们期望有更多预警时间来准备收割。这将使事情复杂化，他们可能会试图撤离并宣战。”

"Let them, we will be more than prepared for them just as we will be for Gendo Ikari's resistance."  
"让他们来吧，我们将做好万全准备，就像对付碇源堂的抵抗一样。"

"Understood, then so be it. I will contact them in the morning informing them that it has been accelerated and to get as many people prepared as possible, if they do not comply then they will be destroyed."  
"明白了，那就这么办。我会在明早联系他们，通知计划已加速，要求尽可能多的人做好准备，如果不服从，他们将被消灭。"

**Marduk Facility 马尔杜克机构**

Rei slowly opened her eyes and tried to sit up, to little success. She waited a moment for the dizziness to subside before she made another attempt. Through the bars of her cage, she could see that it was no longer night time. Just how long had she been out for and what had happened to Asuka or Kaji?  
丽缓缓睁开双眼，试图坐起身来，但成效甚微。她等待了一会儿，直到眩晕感减轻，才再次尝试。透过笼子的栏杆，她能看到不再是夜晚。她究竟昏迷了多久，明日香和加持又发生了什么？

The last thing she could remember was being in the jungle with Asuka and then Asuka had a hallucination of sorts and then they were captured. It was a trap, such a perfect one too. It seems that Marduk and Armiseal were several steps ahead of them. Rei slowly stood up and looked around the cage she was in. It wasn't a huge cage, only a couple of metres square. The entire floor of the cage was covered in sand. Most surprising though was that the door was open and she could easily just walk out.  
她最后记得的是和明日香在丛林中，然后明日香出现了某种幻觉，接着她们就被俘虏了。这是个陷阱，一个设计得极其完美的陷阱。看来马尔杜克和阿米西尔早已领先他们好几步。丽慢慢站起身，环顾四周的笼子。笼子并不大，只有几平方米。整个笼底铺满了沙子。最令人惊讶的是，笼门竟然敞开着，她可以轻易地走出去。

She stood up, still feeling weak from whatever Armiseal had injected into her, everything around her was silent. She couldn't hear the wind, birds or anything, there wasn't even a sound coming from the waves. It was completely silent like she had been placed in the middle of a dead land somewhere. A wave of loneliness swept over her as she looked around, she had never felt like this before. Never longed for anyone to be near her but now she found herself wanting someone there.  
她站起身，仍感到虚弱，不知 Armiseal 给她注射了什么，四周一片死寂。她听不见风声、鸟鸣，甚至连海浪的声音也没有。仿佛置身于某片荒芜之地。一股孤独感涌上心头，她环顾四周，从未如此渴望有人陪伴，此刻却迫切希望有人能在身边。

She felt the effects of the drugs wearing off and stood up, examining the cage a bit more. It was just a standard cage, nothing she could see leading to or from it. The door, as she had noted earlier, was wide open, allowing her to leave if she wanted. She couldn't just leave though, could she? That would be too easy, there had to be more to this. She sat back down and decided to stay put for now. As soon as she sat down her thoughts wandered to Asuka and to the others waiting for them.  
她感觉到药物的效果正在消退，便站起身来，仔细打量着笼子。这只是个普通的笼子，看不出有任何通向或来自它的痕迹。正如之前所见，门大开着，她若想离开随时可以。但她不能就这样离开，不是吗？那太简单了，这其中必定另有玄机。她又坐了回去，决定暂时按兵不动。刚一坐下，她的思绪便飘向了明日香和其他等待他们的人。

_'Is Sohryu in a similar state to what I am in?'  
'惣流现在和我一样处境吗？'_

When she had last seen her Asuka had been frozen to the spot, unable to move or do anything. Was she still the same way?  
上次见到她时，明日香僵立在原地，动弹不得。她现在还是那样吗？

_'She shouldn't have came here, I shouldn't have persuaded Ikari to let her return or to keep her in the hospital. I wanted her to be here, despite how she hates me, because I wanted to help her get Shinji back. I wanted to prove I wasn't a doll...and I failed.'  
“她不该来这里的，我不该说服碇君让她回来，也不该让她留在医院。尽管她恨我，我还是希望她在这里，因为我想要帮她赢回真嗣。我想证明自己不是个玩偶……而我失败了。”_

Rei felt tears threatening to form in her eyes, she looked on in shock, not even sure why she was crying. Was it because she believed she had failed? She wiped her eyes with her hand and looked towards the open cage.  
绫波感到泪水在眼眶中打转，她震惊地看着，甚至不确定自己为何哭泣。是因为她觉得自己失败了吗？她用手擦了擦眼睛，望向敞开的笼子。

_'I...I should try to get them back...if anything happens...I can be replaced.'  
'我...我应该试着把它们找回来...如果发生什么事...我可以被替换。'_

She stood again and walked out of the cage, surprised when nothing happened. It all seemed a little bit too easy. She took a few steps before hearing something making a beeping noise. She turned back round to the cage, trying to find the source of the noise. It seemed to be coming from something on her. She reached into her jacket and found the device, which seemed to be a communication device, although how it worked she did not have any idea.  
她再次站起身，走出笼子，惊讶地发现什么也没发生。这一切似乎有点太容易了。她走了几步，突然听到一阵哔哔声。她转身回到笼子，试图找到声音的来源。似乎是从她身上传来的。她伸手进夹克，找到了那个装置，看起来像是一个通讯设备，尽管她不知道它是如何工作的。

She pressed a button on the side of the device and a screen popped up. The first thing she saw was the face of Armiseal, the person responsible for her being here. The angel smiled arrogantly and began to speak.  
她按下设备侧面的一个按钮，屏幕随即弹出。她首先看到的是阿米西尔的脸，正是这个人让她来到这里。天使傲慢地笑了笑，开始说话。

"_Agent Ayanami, Evangelion Unit Zero, it's nice to see you have awakened and have decided to step out of the cage we gave you. Around the corner from this place you will find basic supplies and what you need to survive."_  
绫波零特工，零号机，很高兴看到你苏醒并决定走出我们为你准备的牢笼。从这个地方的拐角处，你会发现基本的生存物资和所需物品。

She was giving Rei supplies and keeping her alive...why? For what purpose? "Why are you doing this?"  
她给绫波提供物资，让她活下去……为什么？出于什么目的？“你为什么要这么做？”

"_We're not a malicious organisation Ayanami, all we want to do is help humanity. But how can we do that when you and your colleagues keep on interfering? We want an end to this hostility between our two camps, however, that does not come without a price."_  
“我们并非恶意的组织，绫波，我们只是想帮助人类。但当你们和你们的同事不断干涉时，我们该如何做到这一点？我们希望结束我们两个阵营之间的敌对状态，然而，这并非没有代价。”

Armiseal paused for a moment before continuing to talk, _"Currently you are on the same Island as we are. You have been placed in an area where we can watch you easily."_  
Armiseal 顿了顿，随后继续说道，“目前你与我们同在一座岛上。你被安置在一个便于我们监视的区域。”

"Why didn't you just kill me?"  
“为什么不直接杀了我？”

"Killing you would be ruining our opportunity to study you and we would lose our bargaining chip against your people Rei. You know just how special you are to them, the fact that Gendo Ikari went to such trouble to cover up how you were created speaks volumes. Also, you are no use to us dead. You are a miracle Rei Ayanami, you are one of the only living human clones in the world, if not the only one. As you saw we have tried and tried to replicate a human, but imagine our shock when we learnt that one was made over fifteen years ago right under our very noses."  
“杀了你，我们就失去了研究你的机会，也会失去与你族人谈判的筹码。Rei，你很清楚自己对他们有多特别，Gendo Ikari 费尽心思掩盖你诞生的真相，这足以说明问题。而且，你死了对我们毫无用处。Rei Ayanami，你是个奇迹，你是世界上为数不多甚至可能是唯一存活的克隆人。正如你所见，我们多次尝试复制人类，但得知十五年前就有人在我们眼皮底下成功制造出一个克隆人时，我们震惊不已。”

"Is that why you want Katsuragi and her child?"  
"这就是你想要葛城和她孩子的原因吗？"

"_Exactly why we wanted them, it provided us an excellent chance to study what Gendo Ikari did. Why you are the only one to live past a year, what is it about you which makes you so special, Ayanami?"_  
"正是我们想要他们的原因，这给了我们一个绝佳的机会来研究碇源堂做了什么。为什么你是唯一一个能活过一年的，你身上有什么特别之处，绫波？"

"I...do not know what you are talking about."  
"我...不知道你在说什么。"

"_The clones Rei, they're all clones using Angel DNA, just like you are but they don't live they either die in the tank or a few months to a year into life. Why hasn't that happened to you?"_  
"丽，那些克隆体，都是用天使 DNA 制造的，就像你一样，但他们要么在培养槽中死去，要么在生命的前几个月到一年内死亡。为什么你却没有发生这种情况？"

"I do not know the circumstances of my creation."  
"我不清楚自己被创造的具体情况。"

"_I see, well not to worry. Next time we meet we will hopefully have answers either from the samples collected from your core or from Gendo himself. Until that time, enjoy yourself Ayanami, I hope it does not get too lonely for you down there."_  
"我明白了，别担心。下次见面时，我们希望能从你的核心样本或从源堂本人那里得到答案。在那之前，好好享受吧，绫波，希望你在下面不会感到太孤单。"

**Tokyo 3 Streets – 30****th** **October 2300 hours**  
东京 3 号街道 —— 10 月 30 日 23 时

Ignorance, a lack of knowledge or a wilful lack of desire to improve one's actions. People can also be in a state of ignorance in which they do not know or have an unwillingness to know or believe. It can be said that fifteen years after the impact incident humans are in a constant state of ignorance. Ignorance as to what really happened, ignorance as to their upcoming fate. Ignorance that stems from lies fed to them by their governments and the people that run the world, the so called politicians, managers and military leaders.  
无知，或是缺乏知识，或是故意不愿改善自己的行为。人们也可能处于一种无知状态，他们不知道，或者不愿意知道或相信。可以说，在冲击事件发生十五年后，人类一直处于无知状态。对真正发生的事情无知，对即将到来的命运无知。这种无知源于政府和那些管理世界的人，即所谓的政客、经理和军事领导人所灌输的谎言。

Of course, this is due to no fault of theirs. With such a tragic incident people would not dream of questioning things like that. Those that have questioned it, that do know the truth but refused to believe, those are the ones that are truly ignorant. However, it could be said that even if they did accept the truth, who could they turn to?  
当然，这并非他们的过错。在如此悲惨的事件面前，人们不会梦想去质疑这些事情。那些质疑过的人，那些知道真相却拒绝相信的人，他们才是真正的无知。然而，可以说，即使他们接受了真相，他们又能向谁求助呢？

There is of course the old saying that 'ignorance is bliss', that you cannot be affected by something you do not know. This is how many people within the city of Tokyo 3 felt on that night. None of them knew about what was going to happen. They all went about their daily affairs, taxis carried people back and forth from night clubs. Parents tucked their kids up safely in their beds. The corrupt politicians went into their red light districts for their weekly dose of pleasure.  
当然，有句老话说‘无知是福’，你不知道的事情就不会影响你。这就是东京 3 市许多人在那个夜晚的感受。他们中没有人知道即将发生什么。大家都忙于日常事务，出租车穿梭于夜总会之间接送乘客。父母们安顿好孩子在床上安睡。腐败的政客们则前往红灯区，享受他们每周的放纵时光。

It was very similar to the night of the second impact in Tokyo. People believing they were safe, happy. Despite the night life in the inner city the rest of it seemed to be safe, calm and tranquil and then the first light appeared. It wasn't anything noticeable at first, a small white flash in the sky, which seemed like nothing. The second flash, however, that was when people began to take notice. It was a larger white flash, shortly accompanied by a horrific growling noise almost like the engines working the gates of hell had been put on overdrive.  
这和东京第二次冲击之夜颇为相似。人们以为自己安全、快乐。尽管市中心夜生活繁华，但其他地方似乎依然安全、宁静。然后，第一道光出现了。起初并不引人注意，天空中一道微弱的白光，看似无害。然而，第二道闪光出现时，人们开始警觉起来。这是一道更大的白光，紧接着是一阵恐怖的咆哮声，仿佛地狱之门的引擎被推到了极限。

People stopped and looked up at the source of the flash and the growling noise. None of them knew about the impact or what it had been like when it occurred, with an event with only a small handful of survivors it was to be expected. There was a third flash, again another white flash, however, this time an object could be spotted heading towards the city. It was a small capsule shaped object. On the streets people began to panic, startled by this sighting. People began shouting and screaming and pushing their way down the streets.  
人们停下脚步，抬头望向闪光和咆哮声的来源。他们中没有人知道撞击发生时的情景，因为那场灾难只有少数幸存者，这在意料之中。第三次闪光再次出现，又是一道白光，但这次可以看到一个物体正朝城市飞来。那是一个小型胶囊状物体。街道上的人们开始恐慌，被这一景象吓到。人们开始尖叫、呼喊，推搡着穿过街道。

The capsule landed on one of the busy streets, right in the centre of the crowd, killing most of them instantly. The survivors stood transfixed, almost in a hypnotic state, at the small lights being emitted from the capsule. Those that could stand and walk made their way towards it, their mouths wide open almost in a zombie like state. A huge light swept through the street abducting anyone unfortunate enough to get caught up in it. Those that had witnessed this from their hiding places screamed out and scrambled around desperately trying to get away.  
胶囊落在了繁忙街道的中心，正好在人群中央，瞬间夺走了大多数人的生命。幸存者们呆立不动，几乎处于一种催眠状态，凝视着从胶囊中发出的微弱光芒。那些能站立行走的人缓缓向它靠近，嘴巴张得大大的，几乎像僵尸一样。一道巨大的光芒扫过街道，将任何不幸被卷入其中的人带走。那些从藏身之处目睹这一切的人尖叫着，拼命四处逃窜。

Soon the streets were filled with most of Tokyo 3's inner city population. Capsule after capsule were landing in the streets and taking people away. Soon the sky erupted into a series of white flashes as more capsules were sent down and larger objects were spotted. One of the objects stopped over the streets above another crowd of people. It was a huge pyramid shaped craft, on its lower base a huge circular opening could be seen.  
不久，街道上挤满了东京 3 市内的大部分居民。一个接一个的胶囊降落在街道上，将人们带走。很快，天空爆发出一连串白色闪光，更多的胶囊被投下，更大的物体也被发现。其中一个物体停在了另一群人上方的街道上空。这是一艘巨大的金字塔形飞船，在其底部基座上可以看到一个巨大的圆形开口。

The people beneath it screamed and shouted as each person tried to force their way out of this craft's range. Men and women, families and the single, they were all there, all vying for the same goal, to get away from this fate that had been fifteen years in the making. The base of the pyramid shaped craft opened fully as another white light swept over the people in the street, making them vanish almost instantly.  
下面的人群尖叫着，每个人都试图强行逃离这艘飞船的范围。男人和女人，家庭和单身者，他们都在那里，都在争取同一个目标，逃离这个已经酝酿了十五年的命运。金字塔形飞船的基座完全打开，另一道白光扫过街道上的人们，使他们几乎瞬间消失。

Another sound could be heard in the distance, this wasn't one of the crafts though this was something else. A squadron of fighter jets moved into place around the city, they each took aim at one of the pyramid shaped crafts and fired damaging the craft severely. They swept around and got ready for another run, this time though the craft fought back. A ray of light cut through the fighter jets like they were nothing. The people who had stopped to watch the potential fightback felt all their hopes disappear.  
远处又传来一阵声响，但这并非那些飞行器所发出的，而是别的东西。一队战斗机编队飞抵城市上空，各自瞄准一座金字塔形状的飞行器开火，严重损毁了它们。它们盘旋一周，准备再次进攻，然而这次飞行器开始反击。一道光束横扫而过，战斗机如同纸片般被撕裂。那些驻足观看反击希望的人们，心中的希望瞬间破灭。

More jets came into the fray this time they managed to dodge the energy ray sent out by the craft, they fired whatever they had into the craft causing it to crash to the ground. Before anyone had a moment to rejoice though another craft took its place and took out the jets just as easily as the previous one had.  
更多的战斗机加入了战斗，这次它们成功躲避了飞行器发射的能量射线，将所有火力倾泻向飞行器，使其坠落地面。然而，还没等人们来得及欢呼，另一架飞行器便接踵而至，同样轻松地击落了这些战斗机，如同前一架一样。

It went on and on, flashes would occur and people would vanish. It was a panicked frenzy on the streets. Police sirens could be heard under the growl of the crafts hovering over the city and then almost as suddenly as it started there was another flash and all the crafts had gone. People stopped moving, stopped rushing around and looked up towards the sky. Was that it? Was it over, or was this some sick interval? The eye of the storm while another round was prepared? The silence continued. People began moving, still scared and panicked, towards the edge of the city, like some wild march. Millions of people rushing headlong, scared, broken, fearing for theirs and their families' lives.  
这一切持续不断，闪光频现，人们随之消失。街道上陷入一片恐慌的狂乱。警笛声在悬浮于城市上空的飞行器低沉的轰鸣下隐约可闻，然后几乎就在它开始的那一刻，又一道闪光出现，所有飞行器都消失了。人们停止了移动，停止了四处奔逃，抬头望向天空。就这样结束了？还是这只是某种病态的间歇？暴风雨前的宁静，另一轮攻击正在准备中？寂静持续着。人们开始移动，依旧惊恐不安，向城市的边缘涌去，如同一场野性的行军。数百万人不顾一切地奔逃，恐惧、崩溃，为自己的生命和家人的安危担忧。

Minutes passed by and soon the minutes turned to an hour. People were still being routed back to their homes by the police barricades set up on the edges. Children cried, women screamed and the men shouted angrily at the barricades. Angry that they were just being sent back after all that had happened. Media crews were set up at the barricades, reporting on the night's events, asking if this was truly what they thought it was and if this was only the first of many attacks.  
几分钟过去了，很快这几分钟变成了一小时。人们仍被警察设置的路障赶回自己的家中。孩子们哭泣，妇女尖叫，男人们则愤怒地对着路障大喊。他们愤怒于在经历了这一切后，只是被送回原地。媒体团队在路障处搭建起来，报道当晚的事件，询问这是否真的是他们所认为的那样，以及这是否只是众多攻击中的第一次。

**Misato's Residence – 1100 hours  
美里住所 —— 11 点整**

"_Last night there was a repeat of the events which occurred on the thirtieth of October. There has been no official word yet on what is or was happening, however the Japanese Military has been moved into place around Tokyo 3. Eyewitness accounts are reporting the same as we saw two nights ago, white flashes in the sky and strange almost alien spacecraft being reported abducting people. The government has refused to comment on if what we are really seeing is in fact alien beings, but the public certainly seem to be of that opinion._  
昨晚再次发生了与 10 月 30 日类似的事件。目前官方尚未就发生的情况给出明确说法，但日本军方已部署在第三新东京市周边。目击者报告与我们两晚前所见相同，天空中出现白色闪光，并有人报告称看到类似外星飞船的物体绑架民众。政府拒绝就我们所见是否确为外星生物发表评论，但公众显然持此观点。

_Today Tokyo 3 City news has also learned of similar incidents occurring in cities such as New York, London and Melbourne. As can be seen from the images in front of you the tragic incident has left hundreds of thousands of people homeless and just as many missing. Many people are opting to leave the city, but Police have set up barricades and fences around the city in order to contain any threat. However, we do believe an official evacuation will begin at fourteen hundred hours."  
今日，第三新东京市新闻还获悉，纽约、伦敦和墨尔本等城市也发生了类似事件。正如您面前的图像所示，这一悲剧已导致数十万人无家可归，同样数量的人失踪。许多人选择离开城市，但警方已设置路障和围栏以控制任何威胁。然而，我们相信官方疏散将在 14 点开始。_

Misato switched off the TV and hurled her remote at the wall in anger. It was happening all over again, it was the same as the Impact incident only now they were prolonging it. This time though it wouldn't just be a city being taken, it'd be the entire world and there was nothing they could do about it.  
美里关掉了电视，愤怒地将遥控器扔向墙壁。一切又在重演，这和第二次冲击事件如出一辙，只是这次他们延长了时间。然而这一次，不仅仅是城市被夺走，而是整个世界，而他们对此无能为力。

She felt a warm pair of hands move over her and pull her in closely, she looked straight up into Kaji's concerned eyes. Almost immediately she began to sob into his shoulder.  
一双温暖的手轻轻覆盖在她身上，将她紧紧拥入怀中，她抬头直视着加持那充满关切的双眼。几乎立刻，她开始在他的肩膀上抽泣。

She looked past him into her hallway where Kaji had previously placed a pair of suitcases containing all of Misato's belongings. That only made the tears flow more easily, she didn't want to leave. She had protested, but to no avail. She would have to go, it was for the best and for her own protection, but that would mean she would be alone again. Shinji was still gone, Asuka and Rei were gone and Kaji would have to stay behind in Tokyo 3. The only reason she had to leave was because of the baby.  
她越过他望向走廊，那里加持之前放了一对行李箱，装着美里所有的物品。这让她更容易流泪，她不想离开。她曾抗议过，但无济于事。她必须走，这是为了她好，也是为了她的安全，但这意味着她将再次孤独。真嗣依然不见踪影，明日香和绫波也离开了，而加持则不得不留在第三新东京市。她不得不离开的唯一原因，是因为那个孩子。

_'I waited...I wanted this more then anything, to be a parent to have my own child. That's why I cared so much for Shinji but now...because of this I can't even help him, I have to leave because of this...'  
“我等了...我比任何人都渴望成为父母，拥有自己的孩子。这就是为什么我如此关心真嗣，但现在...因为这件事，我甚至无法帮助他，我不得不离开...”_

"Kaji...why can't I stay here?"  
“加持...为什么我不能留在这里？”

Kaji sighed and stroked her hair gently, "I already explained this Misato, it's too dangerous for you in your condition. Where we're sending you it's safe. They won't be able to find you there."  
加持叹了口气，轻轻抚摸着她的头发，“我已经解释过了，美里，你现在的情况太危险了。我们要送你去的地方很安全。他们找不到你的。”

"How do I know that though? How can we even trust Gendo, after all he has done?"  
"可我怎么知道呢？经历了他做的一切，我们怎能再相信碇源堂？"

"You've seen what he has done though, you know why. His methods were inexcusable, but he won't risk losing needless life again for this. He's not willing to sacrifice you and a baby for this cause, that's why he wants you away from here."  
"你已经见识过他的所作所为，你也明白原因。他的手段固然不可原谅，但他不会再为这事白白牺牲无辜生命。他不希望你和宝宝为这事业牺牲，这就是他让你远离这里的原因。"

He released her and she walked over towards the window, looking out over Tokyo 3. It was quiet with no one on the streets. Everyone had either been relegated to their homes or had already left. In the distance battered buildings could be seen from where the capsules had crashed into them on the past two nights. Two days in and already the city was looking like it had been a complete war zone. She only wondered how long it would be until the entire city had been taken.  
他松开她，她走向窗边，俯瞰着第三新东京市。街道空无一人，寂静无声。居民要么被疏散回家，要么已经离开。远处，被前两晚胶囊撞击的建筑物残骸清晰可见。仅仅两天，这座城市已宛如战区。她不禁思索，这座城市彻底沦陷还需多久。

"Even if I do go SEELE will find it."  
"即使我去了，SEELE 也会找到的。"

"They won't find this place, where Gendo is sending you is safe and protected. You'll meet more people from the resistance there. It's in an area that's dangerous to the aliens for some reason, there are certain properties similar to the Longinus artifact that SEELE found."  
"他们找不到这个地方，碇司令送你去的地方既安全又受保护。你会在那里遇到更多抵抗组织的人。那地方对异形来说很危险，因为有些特性类似于 SEELE 发现的朗基努斯遗物。"

She looked at him and just nodded.  
她看着他，只是点了点头。

"I see then I guess...this is goodbye..." she smiled slightly, "Again."  
"看来我想...这是再见..." 她微微一笑，"又一次。"

Kaji smiled back and stood for a moment before embracing her again, "Misato...promise me you'll look after our baby until I return to you..."  
加持回以微笑，站了一会儿后再次拥抱她，"美里...答应我，你会照顾好我们的孩子，直到我回到你身边..."

_2__nd_ _November 2015_ 2015 年 11 月 2 日

**NERV Offices – 0900 hours  
NERV 总部 – 0900 时**

Gendo stepped through the elevator doors and looked down the corridor. Boxes were piled up, filled with other agent's belongings. Most of them had already left. The only ones staying behind were himself, Fuyutsuki and Kaji. Akagi was running the evacuation of the agents within the resistance and using the Magi to ensure NERV would be safe. It was only a matter of time though, SEELE would soon be able to attack. It surprised Gendo that they hadn't already attempted an attack.  
碇源堂穿过电梯门，望向走廊。箱子堆积如山，装满了其他特工的物品。他们大多已经离开。留下的只有他自己、冬月和加持。赤木律子正在组织抵抗力量内的特工疏散，并利用 MAGI 确保 NERV 的安全。但时间不多了，Seele 很快就能发起攻击。碇源堂惊讶于他们尚未尝试攻击。

He stepped up to his office door, this would be the last day he'd be using it. He stepped through the door and looked at his desk. Sitting at the desk was the man responsible for all of this. Gendo smiled coldly and reached for his gun. Keel must have been a fool for coming here. Almost immediately after Gendo felt his hand grasp the metal handle he noticed a series of small red dots aimed directly at his chest.  
他走到办公室门前，这将是他最后一次使用它。他推门而入，目光落在办公桌上。坐在桌前的是这一切的始作俑者。碇源堂冷冷一笑，伸手去拿枪。基尔肯定是个傻瓜，竟敢来这里。碇源堂的手刚握住金属把手，就注意到一连串小红点直接瞄准了他的胸膛。

_'Of course, Keel would never come alone.'  
'当然，基尔永远不会独自前来。'_

"That wouldn't be a good idea my friend, you might have noticed we have some people watching this little meeting and they won't hesitate either. That's the good thing about working with these people, they don't have human emotions to cloud their judgement unlike the people you chose to be part of the Evangelion project."  
“那可不是个好主意，我的朋友，你可能已经注意到我们有些人在监视这次小小的会面，他们也不会犹豫。与这些人合作的好处是，他们没有人类的情感来干扰判断，不像你选择参与 EVA 计划的人。”

Gendo simply stood there, his expression not changing, "What is the nature of this visit, Keel?"  
源渡只是站在那里，表情毫无变化，“基尔，这次来访的目的是什么？”

"To catch up on things old friend, you know without you none of this would have been possible."  
"老友，追上旧时光啊，没有你，这一切都不可能实现。"

"This is not my doing, why did SEELE accelerate the schedule without informing me?"  
"这不是我的作为，为什么 SEELE 会不通知我就加速计划？"

"Why should we inform a traitor of our plans when he refuses to inform us of his?"  
"当他拒绝向我们透露他的计划时，我们为何要向一个叛徒透露我们的计划？"

Gendo smirked arrogantly. Just as he had thought, SEELE had known. He only wondered how long they had known and why they hadn't acted sooner.  
源渡傲慢地笑了。正如他所料，SEELE 已经知晓。他只是好奇他们究竟知道多久，为何没有更早采取行动。

"We've known a long time Gendo, we just didn't act because there was nothing you could have done to stop us. As you saw, any attempts to resist us were useless, Shinji tried and look what happened to him. Sohryu suffered the same fate as her mother and now even Ayanami has been taken. We have all the Evangelions and we have the last two angels. There is no one to stop us."  
“我们早就知道了，源渡，只是没有行动，因为你无法阻止我们。正如你所见，任何反抗都是徒劳的，真嗣尝试过，看看他的下场。惣流遭遇了和她母亲一样的命运，现在连绫波也被夺走了。我们掌握了所有 EVA，还有最后两个使徒。没有人能阻止我们。”

That didn't answer the question Gendo was thinking though, "So why am I still alive?"  
但这并未解答源渡心中的疑问，“那我为何还活着？”

"Because, Gendo, we could still use you. You can do something we want and we can do something you want."  
"因为，源堂，我们仍然需要你。你能做我们想做的事，我们也能做你想做的事。"

"And just what is it I want?"  
"那我究竟想要什么呢？"

"The Evas." Keel paused for a moment before continuing, "There are two angels left. Although they agreed to begin the first stage of harvesting, they still fear the Angels. However, we cannot kill them ourselves, the only thing that can kill an Angel is that which was created from the same thing, the Evangelion. You know that, the ammunition from the Longinus will only go so far with these ones."  
"初号机。" 基尔停顿了一下，继续说道，"还剩下两个使徒。虽然他们同意开始第一阶段的收割，但他们仍然害怕使徒。然而，我们无法亲自杀死他们，唯一能杀死使徒的是由同样物质创造出来的东西，即福音战士。你知道这一点，朗基努斯之枪的弹药对这些使徒只能起到有限的作用。"

"You already have all three of the Evangelions, what possible use could I be?"  
"你已经拥有了三台 EVA，我还能有什么用处呢？"

"Correction, the remaining two Angels have the Eva's, SEELE does not. I'm giving you an opportunity here Gendo, to reclaim the Eva's."  
"纠正一下，剩下的两位使徒持有 EVA，SEELE 并没有。我这是在给你机会，碇，夺回 EVA。"

"And if I refuse?" "如果我拒绝呢？"

"Then they die, the attacks will stop and the Angels will make contact instead, causing the destruction of mankind."  
"然后他们死去，攻击会停止，使徒将直接与人类接触，从而导致人类的毁灭。"

Gendo thought about it for a moment. Keel wasn't giving him a choice. There had never been a choice, but the thought of lowering himself to working for Keel again, to doing his dirty work, it sickened him.  
碇源堂思索片刻。基尔并没有给他选择。从来就没有选择，但一想到要再次为基尔工作，做他的肮脏勾当，这让他感到恶心。

"What do I need to do?"  
"我需要做什么？"

"Prepare some of your resistance members to attack the Marduk facility where Ayanami is being held. When we know that Armiseal is dead then I will give you what you need to find the last Angel. I want you to know this though Ikari, if you try to betray us we will not hesitate to kill you, the remaining Eva's and the child that Katsuragi carries."  
准备一些你的抵抗组织成员，去攻击关押绫波的马尔杜克设施。一旦我们确认亚米西尔已死，我就会给你找到最后一个天使所需的情报。但我要你知道，碇，如果你试图背叛我们，我们绝不会犹豫杀死你、剩下的 EVA 以及葛城怀的孩子。

**Marduk Facility 马尔杜克设施**

Rei looked across at the small building, it was all she had done for the past four days. Studied it and the people inside, their routines, when they moved and when they didn't. Just trying to get a better understanding of how things were done. Their weapons were only basic stun guns, nothing lethal but enough to take someone down for a couple of hours. What she didn't know, however, was what was beyond the perimeter, how many more people would be waiting, or even if there were more looking in.  
绫波凝视着那座小建筑，这是她过去四天一直在做的事。观察它和里面的人，他们的日常，何时移动，何时静止。只是试图更好地理解这一切是如何运作的。他们的武器只是基本的电击枪，没有致命性，但足以让人昏迷几个小时。然而，她不知道的是，在警戒线之外还有什么，会有多少人守候，甚至是否还有更多人在监视。

She had gotten a good idea of what could be done, she just needed to pick the right time to put it into action. She brought her knees up to her chin and shuddered slightly, it was going to be night time soon, night times were cold and lonely. There was nothing to say or do during the day although every so often scientists from the facility would come to her, take samples and question her about her life, how she was born and other questions Rei didn't know the answers to.  
她已经大致了解了可以采取的行动，只是需要选择合适的时机来实施。她将膝盖抱至胸前，微微颤抖，夜晚即将来临，夜晚总是寒冷而孤独。白天无话可说，也无事可做，尽管偶尔会有设施里的科学家来找她，采集样本并询问她的生活，她是如何出生的，以及其他丽无法回答的问题。

The same questions everyday, Rei hadn't resisted with any of it. There was no point, no one had given her an order of what to do, so she had to think for herself. She had to think about it logically, fighting back would only make it worse.  
每天都是同样的问题，丽从未对此进行过任何反抗。没有意义，没有人给她下达过任何指令，所以她必须自己思考。她必须理性地考虑，反抗只会让情况更糟。

It was the first time in her short life she had really had never been given an order or some sort of direction. She still had her overall order in mind, the order too defeat the Angels by any means necessary but that was all she had.  
这是她短暂生命中第一次真正没有被下达过任何命令或指引。她心中仍保留着那个总体的命令，即不惜一切手段击败使徒，但除此之外，她别无他物。

She looked up at the sky and saw a helicopter flying over her going to land on the island. That was unusual, the helicopter wasn't due until later tonight. Every night for the past four nights it had came and gone at the same time. She ignored it and continued looking up at the sky. She wanted to get away from here, away from the injections and the questioning. Her time here alone, it had forced new emotions and feelings onto her. She had felt so much in the past few days that she had never felt before. That loneliness that had always been there inside her, it was now being accompanied by other emotions. Sadness, Anger, even hatred, the emotions would come sporadically and then go as soon as they had arrived.  
她抬头望向天空，看到一架直升机正飞越她头顶，准备降落在岛上。这很不寻常，直升机本应是今晚晚些时候才到的。过去四天里，它每晚都在同一时间来去。她没在意，继续仰望天空。她想逃离这里，远离那些注射和审问。独自在这里的时光，迫使她产生了新的情感和感受。过去几天里，她经历了许多前所未有的情绪。那种一直存在于她内心的孤独感，现在伴随着其他情绪出现了。悲伤、愤怒，甚至是仇恨，这些情绪会突然涌现，又转瞬即逝。

_'Why do I feel all this...I have always felt loneliness...it has always been there but all these other feelings, why are they there?'  
'为什么我会感受到这一切...我一直都感到孤独...它一直存在，但这些其他的感受，它们为何会出现？'_

Rei was broken from her thoughts when she heard the voices of one of the people guarding her, they seemed to be coming towards her. She stood to face them as they brought up their stun guns and aimed them directly at her. They seemed frightened, something must have happened or something must be happening.  
当听到看守她的人的声音时，丽被从思绪中拉回，他们的声音似乎正朝她走来。她起身面对他们，他们举起电击枪，直接对准了她。他们看起来很害怕，一定是发生了什么事，或者正在发生什么。

_'They are anxious__...I could use this to my advantage.'_  
'他们很焦虑...我可以利用这一点。'

Just as she made her decision there was an explosion from the other side of the island. This was her chance. She quickly grabbed the outstretched arm of the guard, causing him to drop the stun gun. Almost immediately she threw him towards the other guard using him as a shield to catch the shot from the gun. Rei nimbly picked up the other gun and took out the remaining guard before taking off towards their outpost.  
正当她下定决心时，岛的另一侧发生了爆炸。这是她的机会。她迅速抓住守卫伸出的手臂，使他掉落了电击枪。几乎立刻，她将他推向另一名守卫，用他作为盾牌挡住枪击。丽迅速捡起另一把枪，击倒了剩下的守卫，然后向他们的哨所冲去。

She would still have to be careful though, she didn't know what would have caused the explosion, but she knew it had something to do with that helicopter she had seen earlier.  
尽管如此，她仍需小心行事，她不知道是什么引发了爆炸，但她知道这与她之前看到的直升机有关。

_'I could use that to escape...I need to find Sohryu first though...'  
'我可以利用这个逃脱...不过我得先找到 Sohryu...'_

Rei made her way towards the outpost. Inside she could hear the voices of several other guards. She waited until she could hear one near the door and swiftly burst inside grabbing hold of him using him as a shield just as she had the other person. She took out the other guards in the room and looked around for anything better than a basic stun gun. She was sure that whatever the guards had in the main complex it would be a little bit more powerful.  
丽小心翼翼地向哨所走去。一进去，她就能听到几个其他守卫的声音。她等到能听到门口附近的一个守卫时，迅速冲进去，像对待之前那个人一样，抓住他作为盾牌。她迅速解决了房间里的其他守卫，并四处寻找比基本电击枪更好的武器。她确信，无论主建筑里的守卫有什么，都会更强大一些。

There was another large explosion from the other side of the Island. She looked into one of the desks and found a small handgun. Examining the ammunition, she noted that it was the same material as the Longinus ammunition.  
岛的另一侧又传来一声巨大的爆炸。她在一个桌子里发现了一把小型手枪。检查弹药时，她注意到它的材质与朗基努斯枪的弹药相同。

_'This should suffice...' '这样应该足够了...'_

**Marduk Facility Interior 马尔杜克设施内部**

Rei quietly closed the door behind her. It had been easy to get inside, almost too easy. Outside she could hear the sound of gunfire. She recognized one of the voices of the people shouting immediately  
丽静静地关上身后的门。潜入这里异常容易，几乎太容易了。外面枪声不断，她立刻辨认出了其中一个人的喊声

_'He has returned for me...'  
'他回来找我了...'_

Rei looked around. She needed to get to Sohryu to help her escape, but first she needed to take care of Armiseal. She moved into the next room and was not surprised to see the base had switched to emergency status. However, what did surprise her was that there was no one in view. Surely they would have kept people guarding inside just in case people started getting in. The familiar feeling of it being a trap crept into Rei's mind.  
丽四处张望。她需要前往苏里尤帮助她逃脱，但首先她得处理阿米西尔。她走进下一个房间，并不意外地发现基地已切换到紧急状态。然而，令她惊讶的是，视线内空无一人。按理说，他们应该会留人在内部以防有人闯入。那种熟悉的感觉——这是个陷阱——悄悄爬上了丽的心头。

She stepped through into one of the laboratories. Once again it was deserted and completely powered down, with only the emergency lights running. Rei carefully crept through it, making sure to keep as low and silent as possible, just in case someone was waiting for her. There was another loud explosion, this time rocking the entire facility.  
她踏入其中一个实验室。再次空无一人，完全断电，只有应急灯亮着。丽小心翼翼地穿过，尽量保持低调和安静，以防有人埋伏。又一声巨响，这次震动了整个设施。

_'That was from inside here. They've managed to get in. I don't have much time then, I must take out the Angel.'  
“那是从这里面传来的。他们已经进来了。那我时间不多了，必须消灭使徒。”_

She moved onto the next laboratory, again finding it in a similar situation. In the distance she could hear the sound of more gunfire. Whoever it was, whether friend or foe, they were getting closer. She stepped out into the next corridor and saw the source of the gun fire. More of the facilities guards fighting against what she recognised as Ikari's resistance.  
她移步到下一个实验室，同样发现情况相似。远处她能听到更多枪声。无论是敌是友，他们正逐渐逼近。她走出走廊，看到了枪声的源头。更多的设施守卫在与她认出是碇的抵抗力量作战。

Immediately she extended her A.T Field and swept the facility guards off of their feet and stepped out into the corridor. One of the men looked forward and smiled.  
她立刻展开了 A.T.力场，将设施守卫们扫倒在地，然后踏入走廊。其中一名男子抬头望向前方，露出了微笑。

"Hold your fire men, we've secured her."  
"停火，伙计们，我们控制住她了。"

Rei turned to him and began questioning him, "Who is leading this attack?"  
丽转过身来开始质问他，“谁在指挥这次攻击？”

"Gendo is leading half of us while Agent Kaji leads the other half. Our objective is to get you and take you out of here while Gendo takes care of Armiseal."  
"源堂指挥我们的一半人马，而代理局长加持负责另一半。我们的目标是带你离开这里，同时源堂负责处理阿米西尔。"

Rei nodded, "I want you to change your objective."  
丽点点头，“我希望你改变目标。”

"With all due respect I think it would be-"  
“恕我直言，我认为这会——”

Rei instantly interrupted him, seeming to channel some of Asuka's impatience, "I want you to locate Agent Sohryu and get her to safety, I will be fine on my own. I will assist the Director with taking out Armiseal."  
丽立刻打断了他，似乎借用了明日香的一些急躁，“我要你找到苏里乌特工并确保她的安全，我一个人没问题的。我会协助局长消灭阿尔米西尔。”

The man began to protest, but then he saw how determined Rei was. He knew it would be useless arguing with her. "I understand, we will locate Sohryu and get her out of here."  
那男人开始抗议，但随即看到丽如此坚决。他明白与她争论是无用的。“我明白了，我们会找到惣流并把她带出去。”

"Good." “好。”

Rei did not give him a chance to respond. Instead she began to run in the other direction, towards the centre of the complex, where she could sense Armiseal, to where she could sense Gendo. She had completed one of her objectives, rescuing Sohryu, now she just needed to complete the other one. Destroying the Angel that had brought her here.  
丽没有给他回应的机会。相反，她开始向另一个方向奔跑，朝着建筑群的中心，她能感应到亚米西尔的地方，她能感应到源堂的地方。她已经完成了一个目标，救出了惣流，现在她只需要完成另一个目标。摧毁那个将她带到这里的天使。

She continued running until she eventually found herself in a larger room with a multitude of equipment set up around it. As soon as she entered she felt herself get pushed to the ground by an A.T. Field. She looked around and found herself looking up at Armiseal. Her eyes were glowing and her A.T. Field was highly visible.  
她继续奔跑，最终发现自己进入了一个更大的房间，周围摆满了各种设备。她一进门，就被一个 A.T.力场推倒在地。她环顾四周，发现自己正抬头看着亚米西尔。她的眼睛闪烁着光芒，A.T.力场异常明显。

"Welcome daughter of Lillith, how predictable that I should find you here. Now I will ensure that you do not leave alive just like the rest of your path-"  
"欢迎莉莉丝之女，我在这里找到你真是意料之中。现在，我将确保你像你的同伴一样，无法活着离开——"

She was cut off when she felt a bullet tear through her A.T. Field and go right into her chest. She turned around with shock in her eyes and found herself looking at Gendo Ikari accompanied by several other men each with their rifles aimed directly at Armiseal.  
她的话被突然打断，当她感觉到一颗子弹撕裂她的 A.T.力场并直穿胸膛。她转过身，眼中满是震惊，发现自己正面对着碇源堂，他身边还有几个男人，每个人都举着步枪，瞄准了阿米西尔。

"I should have known..." "我早该料到的……"

She stumbled forward as her body began to glow more vibrantly. Eventually the glowing around Armisael's body subsided revealing that her wounds had completely healed. Gendo raised his hand, signalling the other members not to fire at her.  
她踉跄前行，身体开始更加明亮地发光。最终，围绕着亚尔米塞的身体的光芒消退，显露出她的伤口已完全愈合。源堂举起手，示意其他成员不要向她开火。

"So SEELE did betray us, just as I thought they would."  
“果然，SEELE 背叛了我们，正如我所料。”

"You betrayed yourself by trusting a person like Keel."  
“你背叛了自己，竟信任像基尔这样的人。”

Armiseal laughed and spat back at him, "Says the person who is carrying out his dirty work. Just so he can save that abomination lying over there. I give you credit Gendo, we were using Angel DNA or that of Adam. We didn't think to use Lillith, but I wonder why you would choose such a weak specimen."  
亚尔米西尔大笑着朝他吐了口唾沫，“说这话的人却在干脏活。就为了救那边躺着的那个怪物。我得承认，碇，我们用的是天使的 DNA，或者是亚当的。我们没想到用莉莉丝，但我想知道你为何选择这么一个弱小的样本。”

Gendo smiled arrogantly before speaking, "Weakness is not defined by the specimen we choose, but by the person. That is why all the other Angels before you died, just as you will."  
碇源堂傲慢地笑了笑，然后说道，“弱小并非由我们选择的样本决定，而是由人本身决定。这就是为什么在你之前的所有使徒都死了，就像你也将死去一样。”

Gendo lifted up his gun and fired more shots towards Armiseal. She quickly moved out of the way and threw Ayanami into the path of one of the bullets. Rei felt the bullet graze past her arm as she fell to the floor. Armiseal took this chance to flee towards the upper level.  
碇源堂举起枪，向亚尔米西尔连开数枪。她迅速闪开，并将绫波丽推向一颗子弹的路径。丽感觉到子弹擦过她的手臂，随即倒在地上。亚尔米西尔趁机逃向上层。

Gendo ran over to Rei and knelt down beside her as she tried to get up. He helped her to her feet as she screamed out in pain.  
源渡快步跑到丽身边，跪在她旁边帮她起身。她痛苦地尖叫着，他扶她站了起来。

"You...You came for me..."  
“你……你来救我了……”

"Yes I did, I'm sorry it took so long Rei."  
“是的，我来了，对不起让妳久等了，丽。”

She knelt up, "I am glad...has Sohryu been located yet?"  
她跪起身，“我很高兴……相龙已经被找到了吗？”

"I don't know, we need to get you out of here."  
“我不知道，我们需要带你离开这里。”

She looked into his eyes before shaking her head, "No, I need to stop the Angel."  
她凝视着他的眼睛，然后摇了摇头，“不，我必须阻止使徒。”

Gendo looked up at the upper levels, Armiseal had moved into one of the control rooms. He couldn't send any of the people with him up there, it would mean certain death and if he left without killing the Angel then Keel would destroy any hope of them ever being able to fight back. Much to his reluctance he had to let Rei do this.  
源度抬头望向高层，阿尔米斯尔已经移动到了其中一个控制室。他不能派任何人上去，那意味着必死无疑，如果他就这样离开而没有杀死使徒，基尔就会摧毁他们反击的任何希望。尽管极不情愿，他不得不让绫波去做这件事。

He nodded, "Fine I..." 他点点头，"好吧，我……"

He trailed off, unsure of what to say. Rei stood up and turned to him smiling, "Thank you."  
他话音渐弱，不知该说什么。绫波站起身，转向他微笑道，"谢谢你。"

She moved up the staircase towards Armiseal as she heard Gendo and the others make there way out of the room. She felt Armiseal send out another A.T. Field as she got to the top of the steel staircase, but she was ready this time. She expanded her own A.T. Field to try to counteract Armiseal's and felt herself get knocked back a bit.  
她沿着楼梯向上走向阿米西尔，同时听到源渡和其他人离开房间的动静。当她到达钢制楼梯顶端时，感觉到阿米西尔再次释放了 A.T.力场，但这次她已有所准备。她扩展自己的 A.T.力场试图抵消阿米西尔的，却感到自己被稍稍击退。

Armiseal snarled back at her from inside the control room, "You're persistent."  
阿米西尔在控制室内对她咆哮道：“你真是执着。”

She ran over to one of the consoles in the facility and began hastily typing commands into it. Rei dashed at her, tackling her to the ground just as sirens flared up around the base. Armiseal laughed and pinned Rei to the ground, "You see Rei, if I'm going to die I'm taking the daughter of Lillith with me."  
她跑到设施中的一台控制台前，开始匆忙输入指令。零号机冲向她，将她扑倒在地，与此同时基地内警报大作。阿米西尔大笑着将零号机按在地上，“你看，零号机，如果我要死，我会带着莉莉丝的女儿一起。”

Rei threw Armiseal off of her and fired several shots into the Angel's body. Armiseal staggered back, screaming out loudly as she began to glow and heal herself again. This time, however, the results were different. She continued glowing and moved towards Rei. She reached back, ready to hit Rei, but Rei barely managed to dodge out of the way.  
丽将阿米西尔从身上甩开，向天使的身体连开数枪。阿米西尔踉跄后退，尖叫着开始发光并自我治愈。然而这一次，结果却不同了。她持续发光并向丽靠近。她伸手准备击打丽，但丽勉强躲开了。

Rei moved around and fired another shot at the Angel, again having no effect. It just seemed that after each shot Rei fired the Angel would just heal itself. Rei threw the gun down and instead opted to dive at Armiseal, sending them both crashing to the floor. Rei held Armiseal down pinning her by the shoulders.  
丽四处移动，又向天使开了一枪，依然毫无效果。似乎每次丽开枪后，天使都会自我治愈。丽扔下枪，转而选择扑向阿米西尔，两人一起摔倒在地。丽按住阿米西尔，用肩膀压住她。

"You can't win Rei, I know you better than you know yourself. Everything that happened to you the past four days, all those emotions you were feeling, who did you think was responsible for them?"  
“你赢不了我的，丽，我比你更了解你自己。过去四天里发生在你身上的一切，那些你感受到的情绪，你以为是谁造成的？”

Rei didn't move, but instead kept Armiseal pinned down. However, as she was pinning her down she felt rage building up inside her, "You...are responsible for this?"  
零没有动，反而继续将阿米西尔压住。然而，当她压制住她时，内心涌起的愤怒让她质问：“你……是这一切的罪魁祸首？”

Armiseal laughed, "It was a gift Rei, something to give you what you always wanted, a chance to feel more human before you suffered the fate of all humans."  
阿米西尔笑道：“这是给你的礼物，零，让你在承受所有人命运之前，有机会更贴近人类的感觉。”

Rei looked on in shock at what she was hearing, this was just enough chance for Armiseal to gain some leverage and throw Rei off of her. "Of course Rei, it'll only be your soul that dies."  
零震惊地听着这一切，这给了阿米西尔一个机会，她趁机挣脱并把零甩开。“当然，零，只有你的灵魂会消逝。”

With those words Armiseal began to glow again, only this time it wasn't to heal her wounds. Instead the glow began to leave Armiseal's body and went straight towards Rei. She was unable to get out of the way and screamed out in pain as the creature latched onto her.  
随着这些话音落下，亚米西尔再次开始发光，只是这一次并非为了治愈她的伤口。相反，光芒开始从亚米西尔的身体中逸出，直奔丽而去。她无法躲开，痛苦地尖叫起来，因为那生物紧紧附着在她身上。

As soon as it did her entire life flashed before her, the first time she woke up after being created. Seeing Gendo Ikari for the first time, the man who she thought of as her father. Then fifteen years later meeting Shinji and Asuka and fighting alongside them against the Angels. She felt the Angel spread inside her as she screamed out in pain.  
光芒一触及她，她的一生便在眼前闪现，第一次醒来后的情景。第一次见到碇源堂，那个她视为父亲的男人。然后是十五年后遇见真嗣和明日香，与他们并肩对抗使徒。她感到使徒在她体内蔓延，痛苦地尖叫着。

"_It's…it's taking over me."_  
“它……它正在控制我。”

She looked up at the timer above the control panel. The structure was still rigged to be destroyed and she had to ensure the Angel went along with it. Even if that meant sacrificing herself. She made her way over towards the control panel, pain was shooting through her body as she felt the Angel inside her. It was almost as if it was ripping her apart.  
她抬头看向控制面板上方的计时器。结构体仍被设定为毁灭，她必须确保使徒随之消亡。即便这意味着牺牲自己。她蹒跚走向控制面板，剧痛如电流般贯穿全身，她感到体内的使徒，仿佛要将她撕裂。

She reached for the communications device, needing to send out a message to Gendo, to inform them what was happening. As she did so she noticed something hitting the monitors on the panel, she reached her hand up to her face and for some reason she smiled.  
她伸手去拿通讯设备，需要向碇发送消息，告知他们正在发生的事。就在这时，她注意到有什么东西撞击着面板上的显示器，她抬起手触碰脸颊，不知为何，她笑了。

_'I...I am crying...but why?'  
'我...我在哭泣...但为何？'_

**Helicopter 直升机**

The helicopter started up as Gendo and the others got on board. He turned around, looking out for her. She had said she would be here soon, so why wasn't she? He watched Kaji and Fuyutsuki getting Sohryu on board and secured as the chopper began to lift off. He turned and shouted towards the pilot.  
随着源堂和其他人登上直升机，它启动了。他转过身，四处寻找她。她说过她很快就会到，那为什么还没来？他看着加持和冬月将惣流扶上飞机并固定好，随着直升机开始升空，他转身向飞行员大喊。

"What are you doing? There's still one more."  
“你在干什么？还有一个人。”

Before the pilot could reply a crackling noise could be heard over the choppers main communications channel. Gendo listened closely to the words coming through on the device, they were Rei's words. She was speaking to him, to them all.  
在飞行员来得及回应之前，直升机的主通讯频道上传来了一阵噼啪声。源度仔细聆听着从设备中传来的话语，那是丽的声音。她在对他说话，对所有人说话。

"_I...I am sorry but...I have to do this to help you all."_  
“我……我很抱歉，但是……我必须这么做来帮助你们所有人。”

There was a slight pause before she continued, _"This is what my purpose was, this is the reason I was born and I understand that... but I do not wish to leave even though I must."_  
她稍作停顿，然后继续说道：“这是我存在的目的，这是我诞生的原因，我明白这一点……但我并不希望离开，尽管我必须这么做。”

There was a pause on the device, Gendo was frozen in place as she started speaking again. _"Tell... Tell Shinji I am sorry I am unable to see him again."_  
设备中传来一阵沉默，源渡僵立原地，她再次开口：“告诉……告诉真嗣，我很抱歉不能再见到他了。”

She paused again, _"Tell Sohryu that I am sorry for what I caused her during this...that I am sorry for following orders so blindly and that with this action I hope she can forgive me..."_  
她再次停顿，“告诉惣流，我为在这期间给她带来的伤害道歉……我为如此盲目地服从命令而道歉，希望这一行为能让她原谅我……”

She paused again, it was clear that she was crying, _"Director...Father...I am sorry for leaving you... thank you for giving me life."_  
她又一次停顿，显然是在哭泣，“局长……父亲……我很抱歉离开您……谢谢您赋予我生命。”

_The sound cut off again as everyone in the helicopter was silent. Then it happened. Gendo lurched forward only to be held back by Kaji. Everyone watched in a stunned silence as the entire facility erupted in a ball of flame. Gendo screamed out Rei's name as he watched the only person he had ever felt close too besides his wife sacrifice herself right in front of his eyes.  
直升机的轰鸣声再次中断，机内一片死寂。紧接着，那一幕发生了。源堂猛地向前一倾，却被加持拉住。众人目瞪口呆地看着整个设施在烈焰中爆炸。源堂嘶吼着绫波的名字，眼睁睁看着除妻子外唯一让他感到亲近的人，在他眼前牺牲。_

### Chapter 28 A Tout Le Monde

A/N: Sorry about the long wait with this one, I got about half way through and had to restart because of comp problems. I did make up for it by making it, in my opinion, a lot better then the original version so at least something good came out of it.  
作者注：很抱歉让大家久等了，写到一半时因为电脑问题不得不重写。不过，我认为新版本比原版好很多，至少这一点是值得欣慰的。

_5__th_ _September 2015_ 2015 年 9 月 5 日

**'Who Needs Information?' “谁需要信息？”**

My body felt heavy as I awoke, I say awoke, but it certainly didn't feel like I was waking up. My eyes could barely open, my body wouldn't move. Slowly I was able to open my eyes completely and I found myself staring up at a blank ceiling. My first guess was that I was in a hospital bed but as my eyes adjusted to the new light I could see that the ceiling I was looking at resembled that of a prison cell more than that of a hospital room. It was more of a dark, oppressive metallic colour. I looked to my side and saw the walls had been crudely painted a similar colour, however there were various indentations and markings mottled across the surface.  
醒来时，我感到身体沉重，说是醒来，但感觉并不像真正苏醒。眼睛几乎睁不开，身体动弹不得。慢慢地，我完全睁开了眼睛，发现自己正盯着一片空白的屋顶。我首先猜测自己躺在医院床上，但随着视线适应新的光线，我发现眼前的天花板更像监狱牢房的，是一种暗沉压抑的金属色。我转头看向墙壁，它们被粗略地涂成了相似的颜色，但表面布满了各种凹痕和标记。

I tried once again to raise my hand to try to feel along the wall. It rose slightly but limply fell back to the bed I was lying on again. The feeling I had, it was almost like there was something pinning me down, I knew I could move, I had just proven that. I could feel my body, but it just felt like there was some external force holding me down.  
我再次尝试抬起手去触摸墙壁。手微微抬起，却又无力地落回躺着的床上。那种感觉，几乎像是有什么东西压着我，我知道自己能动，刚才已经证明了。我能感觉到自己的身体，但就像有某种外力在压制我。

I tried to raise my hand one more time but to no avail. It rose a few inches and then nothing. I would just have to wait, wait until this strange force left me or until someone entered my apocalyptic prison cell. I felt incredibly uncomfortable, whatever I was lying on certainly wasn't built for comfort not that there was anything I could do about it.  
我再次试图抬起手，却徒劳无功。它勉强上升了几英寸，然后就停滞不前。我只能等待，等待这股奇异的力量离开我，或是等待有人进入我这末日般的牢房。我感到极度不适，无论我躺的是什么，显然都不是为了舒适而设计的，尽管对此我无能为力。

As I lay there I began to wonder just how I gotten there. I could remember certain things but they seemed so distant, some of the memories were there stronger than the others. I could remember the day, myself and Asuka were investigating the disappearance of Kawaoru Nagisa. I didn't really know the reasons why, but I knew of his importance as the head of Marduk so I could understand NERV getting involved.  
躺在那里，我开始思考自己是如何来到这里的。我能记得一些事情，但它们似乎如此遥远，有些记忆比其他的更为清晰。我记得那天，我和明日香正在调查渚薰的失踪案。我不太清楚原因，但我知道作为马尔杜克组织的负责人，他的重要性不言而喻，因此 NERV 介入也是可以理解的。

With myself and Asuka being assigned the case though, naturally that meant it was important to SEELE or to my father. Once again we were just pawns in their battle. That was all I would ever really be I guess, a pawn, a device to be used and discarded at will. Someone finds a use for me and all is well, but once that use is gone I'm immediately discarded.  
既然我和明日香被指派了这个案件，自然这意味着它对 SEELE 或对我父亲来说很重要。我们又一次成了他们斗争中的棋子。我想，我永远都只会是一个棋子，一个可以随意使用和丢弃的工具。有人发现我有用，一切就都好，但一旦用处消失，我就会被立即抛弃。

I remember being at Misato's though. She had called me and Asuka when we were on our way to NERV. I remember her telling me that she had seen that other agent who had been assigned to work with us, he had tried to attack her, to attack her baby. I remember going after him and finding out he had Asuka and then...  
我记得当时在美里那里。她在我们前往 NERV 的路上打电话给我和明日香。我记得她告诉我，她见到了那个被指派与我们合作的另一位特工，他试图攻击她，攻击她的孩子。我记得我追了上去，发现他挟持了明日香，然后……

I can remember what happened then, I don't really want to though. I forced the memory away, it was too painful. I was fully realizing the severity of my situation, I had...I had let her down. I had made a promise to her and now...I had broken that promise. The image came into my mind again despite my attempts to force it away. As it replayed in my conscience I felt a familiar stinging sensation in the back of my eyes. The images replayed almost like they had happened only a few minutes ago, there he was holding her up. He reached his arm back and plunged a blade right through her body.  
我记得接下来发生了什么，但真的不想再去回想。我强迫自己忘掉那段记忆，它太痛苦了。我开始完全意识到自己处境的严重性，我……我让她失望了。我曾向她许下承诺，而现在……我违背了那个承诺。尽管我试图强迫自己不去想，那个画面还是再次浮现在我的脑海中。当它在我的良知中重播时，我感到眼后熟悉的刺痛感。这些画面重播得仿佛就发生在几分钟前，他就那样举着她。他伸出手臂，将一把刀直插进她的身体。

I blinked it away, I didn't want to relive this. I needed to get out of here, I needed to move or this was just going to get worse. I tried once again to raise my hand, some of the pressure I had felt earlier had eased but the majority was still there. I was able to raise it to a point and ran my hand along the wall feeling its cold steel surface.  
我眨眼驱散了那股情绪，我不想重温这一切。我需要离开这里，我需要移动，否则情况只会变得更糟。我再次尝试抬起手，之前感受到的部分压力已经缓解，但大部分依旧存在。我能够将手抬到一定高度，沿着墙壁摸索，感受着它冰冷的钢铁表面。

Okay this is good, some movement. I focused on the other hand and moved. The pressure I felt on me before was definitely beginning to fade. I could actually move again, with each movement I felt some slight pain but I could actually move.  
好吧，这还不错，有些动作了。我集中注意力在另一只手上并开始移动。之前感受到的压力确实在逐渐消退。我终于又能动了，每动一下都感到些许疼痛，但我真的能动了。

I shifted myself into a sitting position and looked around my cell, despite attempts not to, the thoughts of Asuka and all the others came back into my mind. Asuka, Ayanami, Misato, Kaji...even my father. Did they know where I was? Were any of them looking for me? Was Asuka even...  
我挪动身体坐了起来，环顾四周的牢房，尽管努力不去想，但关于明日香和其他人的思绪还是涌入了脑海。明日香、绫波、美里、加持...甚至是我父亲。他们知道我在哪里吗？有人在找我吗？明日香她甚至...

I felt a tear rolling down my cheek as I quickly brushed it away. There was no avoiding that thought though, I didn't even know if Asuka was alive. I can remember holding her in my arms after...after I killed Carter. I remember telling her that everything would be all right but I also remember the amount of blood she was losing. I remember where she had been stabbed. Anyone else stabbed in the same place would have died instantly. I suppose it was only because of the Evangelion serum flowing through her that she was able to survive as long as she did.  
我感到一滴泪水顺着脸颊滑落，迅速将其拭去。然而，那个念头却无法回避，我甚至不知道明日香是否还活着。我记得在...在我杀了卡特之后，我曾抱着她。我记得我告诉她一切都会好起来的，但也记得她流失的大量鲜血。我记得她被刺中的部位。换作其他人，在同样的地方被刺中会立即丧命。我想，正是因为她体内流淌着福音战士的血清，她才能坚持那么久。

Another tear rolled down my face as I tried to get rid of the thought, get rid of the feeling that I had failed her. It felt so unfair that she might be dead and I was sat here feeling sorry for myself. She was a strong person, she was stronger than me she was a better person. I shouldn't be the one here, what did I have to offer the world? I was nothing more than a gear in a bigger machine...  
又一颗泪珠滑过我的脸庞，我试图摆脱这个念头，摆脱那种我辜负了她的感觉。她可能已经死去，而我却坐在这里自怨自艾，这感觉太不公平了。她是个坚强的人，比我更坚强，她是个更好的人。我不应该是留在这里的那个人，我能给这个世界带来什么呢？我不过是庞大机器中的一颗齿轮...

I guess this was my punishment. This was what I deserved; to be here alone. This might be for the best, anyone that comes into contact with me either ends up getting hurt or abandoning me. The two people I allowed myself to love are either dead or in danger. Maybe I should have just left when I had the chance, it would have been easier for them.  
我想这便是我的惩罚。这是我应得的；独自一人留在这里。或许这样最好，任何与我接触的人要么受伤，要么离我而去。我允许自己爱的那两个人，一个已逝，一个身处险境。也许我当初应该抓住机会离开，那样对他们来说会更容易些。

I wiped my eyes again just as I heard the door to my cell open, I didn't look up at the person who entered. I didn't even care who it was, all I cared about was Asuka or Misato. I needed to know...I needed to find out how they were and I needed to apologize to them for being such a fuck up. If it wasn't for me...maybe they wouldn't have had to put up with all of this.  
我再次擦干眼泪，就在这时我听到了牢房门打开的声音，我没有抬头看进来的人是谁。我甚至不在乎那是谁，我所关心的只有明日香或美里。我需要知道……我需要了解他们的状况，我需要向他们道歉，因为我是个如此糟糕的人。如果不是因为我……也许他们就不必承受这一切。

"Shinji Ikari..." “碇真嗣……”

I didn't speak, I just simply nodded. I still didn't look up at the person who had entered. There was a strange familiarity to his voice though. It was strange how hearing it...it seemed to ease me slightly.  
我没有说话，只是简单地点了点头。我仍然没有抬头看那个进来的人。尽管如此，他的声音却有一种奇怪的熟悉感。奇怪的是，听到他的声音...似乎让我稍微放松了一些。

"What you are about to hear Shinji might be a bit of a shock and I'll understand if your reaction is not...favourable.  
“真嗣，你即将听到的可能会让你有些震惊，如果你的反应不...那么令人满意，我也能理解。”

I looked up at him wondering what he was talking about. As soon as my eyes made contact with his I had to stop my mouth from opening in shock. I was sure he could have seen it though, from the way my eyes widened. I didn't really know what to think or say, I wondered if maybe this was some sort of sick joke or maybe I was in some bizarre dream. Standing in front of me, was the person me and Asuka had been sent to find, the man who was the head of one of the worlds largest organisations... Kaworou Nagisa.  
我抬头看着他，想知道他在说什么。当我的目光与他接触时，我不得不阻止自己因震惊而张开嘴巴。我确信他可能已经看到了，从我眼睛睁大的样子。我真不知道该想些什么或说些什么，我怀疑这可能是个恶作剧，或者我正处于某种奇怪的梦境中。站在我面前的，正是我和明日香被派去寻找的人，那个世界最大组织之一的领导人...渚薰。

"I am Kaworou Nagisa, the same Kaworou Nagisa you and your partner were charged with finding a few days ago..."  
"我是渚薰，就是你和你的搭档几天前被指派寻找的那位渚薰……"

I still couldn't speak, I had nothing I wanted to say. I waited for him to speak and instead just stared down at the floor.  
我依旧说不出话，没有任何想表达的。我只是等待着他开口，同时低头凝视着地板。

"I am sure you will have a lot of questions regarding your situation and I will do my best to answer them. I want you to know that I will be offering the truth to you, I do not intend to sell you a series of half truths like Keel, or use you like your father."  
"我确信你们对目前的处境有许多疑问，我会尽我所能解答。我想让你们知道，我将向你们提供真相，不会像基尔那样兜售一堆半真半假的话，也不会像你父亲那样利用你们。"

He knew about Keel and my father? He knew who I was...what was I supposed to do?  
他知道基尔和我父亲的事？他知道我是谁...我该怎么办？

"I will not be able to explain everything immediately as I am needed elsewhere. Unfortunately much like you Shinji Ikari I have been a passenger on this train of manipulation and mind games for a long time, however, unlike you, I do not have a choice in what I do. That is why I have brought you here, that is why I am offering you the truth."  
“我无法立即解释一切，因为我还有其他任务。不幸的是，就像你碇真嗣一样，我长久以来也是这场操纵和心理游戏的乘客，然而，与你不同的是，我没有选择的余地。这就是为什么我带你来这里，这就是为什么我向你提供真相。”

I still didn't really know what to say. There was one thing, but I was sure he didn't know and besides...what if it wasn't the answer I wanted. Maybe I was being selfish but...while I didn't know the answer there was still hope but if I did know the answer...if there was confirmation that she was gone...then...how would I ever live with myself?  
我仍然不知道该说什么。有一件事，但我确信他不知道，而且...万一那不是我想要的答案呢。也许我有点自私，但...只要我不知道答案，就还有希望，但如果我真的知道了答案...如果证实她已经不在了...那...我该如何面对自己？

I instead settled for something a bit more basic, I know it was maybe a bit pathetic and cowardly of me but...that was who I was.  
我转而选择了一种更为基础的方式，我知道这或许显得有些可悲和懦弱，但...这就是我。

"Where am I?" “我在哪儿？”

Kaworou smiled, "You are...you're not on Earth any more. You are currently inside a...well...I guess it's a prison ship. It is used to transport people who have been abducted, or at least it was...the ship was loaned to Marduk by SEELE for our own personal use. Many experiments are done up here, ones that...ones that I'm not really proud of but were forced to do by SEELE."  
卡沃鲁微笑着说：“你现在...已经不在地球上了。你目前在一艘...呃...可以说是监狱船里。它原本用于运送被绑架的人，至少曾经是...这艘船是 SEELE 借给马尔杜克供我们个人使用的。在这里进行了许多实验，那些...那些我并不引以为傲，但却是 SEELE 强迫我们进行的。”

The smile soon changed to a look I recognised, I decided not to pry much further but he had mentioned SEELE so I had to know more, "So...do you work for SEELE?"  
那笑容很快变成了我熟悉的眼神，我决定不再深究，但他提到了 SEELE，我必须了解更多，“那么……你是为 SEELE 工作的吗？”

He nodded, "I do. It is a complicated story but suffice to say I was selected by SEELE to run the Marduk Institute and prepare Earth for the new impact. My purpose will soon be fulfilled. _That_ is why you are here. We were destined to meet Shinji Ikari...and soon you will have to make a difficult choice."  
他点头道：“是的。这是一个复杂的故事，但简而言之，我是被 SEELE 选中来管理 Marduk Institute 并为地球迎接新的冲击做准备的。我的使命即将完成。这就是你在这里的原因。我们注定要遇见碇真嗣……而你很快将面临一个艰难的选择。”

My destiny? My purpose…I already knew my so called purpose; it was to be a puppet, to go from one new owner to another. I didn't have choices, I didn't have a say, no matter how much I tried. Everything I did was just for someone else's gain or amusement. Even if I did have a choice how would I know what was right? I'd just end up hurting someone either way...why couldn't I just leave it all behind?  
我的命运？我的目的……我早已知晓所谓的目的；不过是成为傀儡，从一个新主人转到另一个。我没有选择，没有发言权，无论我如何努力。我所做的一切都只是为了他人的利益或娱乐。即便我有选择，我又如何知道什么是对的？无论如何我都会伤害到某人……为何我不能就此放下一切？

"I see." "原来如此。"

I didn't have anything else to say past that, I just thought about what he had said and stared down at the floor. I desperately wanted to ask about her but I just couldn't, then he said something. It was almost as if he was looking into my mind before he said it.  
我无言以对，只是反复思索着他刚才的话，目光不由自主地落在地板上。我迫切地想询问她的消息，却始终开不了口，直到他再次出声，仿佛在说出口之前已洞悉了我的心思。

"Shinji, she is alive you know...you saved her just in time. Thanks to you she survived..."  
“真嗣，你知道吗，她还活着...你及时救了她。多亏了你，她才得以生还...”

With those words he left the room leaving me to think for a few more moments. He must have meant Asuka...who else could he have meant? I felt more tears rolling down my face but I wasn't really sure why. Surely I should be happy after hearing that...and I was happy, I was ecstatic. She was still alive, she wasn't dead after all but something still hung over me, maybe it was the realization that I'd never see her again. I whispered quietly to myself a few simple words, she wouldn't have heard them but I knew she'd want to hear them.  
说完这些，他离开了房间，留下我独自沉思片刻。他指的肯定是明日香...还能是谁呢？泪水再次滑落我的脸颊，我不确定为何而哭。听到这个消息，我本该感到高兴...确实，我欣喜若狂。她还活着，她并没有死，但某种阴影仍笼罩着我，或许是意识到我可能再也见不到她了。我轻声对自己说了几句简单的话，她听不见，但我知道她会想听到的。

_I promise Asuka...that I'll return to you.  
我向明日香保证...我会回到你身边。_

**Red Sector 'A' 红色区域 'A'**

Five days I think, yeah that must have been right, I had been here five days. I didn't have a clock or anything to keep track of time but I was sure it had been five days. The rate in which they gave me food and my sleeping patterns seemed to indicate that. Then again it wasn't like I had been doing much eating or sleeping in that time. I couldn't eat, every time I tried I just felt so damn sick and I don't even know why. Logically I shouldn't be feeling guilty, right? Asuka was safe, Misato was safe and it wasn't my fault I was here so why did I feel guilty?  
我想是五天吧，对，应该没错，我在这里已经五天了。我没有钟表或其他任何东西来记录时间，但我确信已经五天了。他们给我食物的频率和我的睡眠模式似乎都表明了这一点。不过话说回来，在那段时间里我并没有怎么吃东西或睡觉。我吃不下，每次尝试都感到极度恶心，甚至不知道为什么。从逻辑上讲，我不应该感到内疚，对吧？明日香安全，美里也安全，我在这里并不是我的错，那我为什么感到内疚呢？

Sleeping, well that was just the same. Each time I closed my eyes I just saw Carter trying to kill Asuka, how he brought that blade back and stabbed it straight through her body. How she screamed out and fell to the floor, how I saw the blood leaking from her body. Yet she was safe, she was all right and I had rescued her. Of course I guess if it wasn't for me she wouldn't have been in that position anyway.  
至于睡觉，情况也一样。每次我闭上眼睛，就看到卡特试图杀死明日香，他如何挥刀刺穿她的身体。她如何尖叫着倒在地上，我如何看到她的血从身体里流出。然而她是安全的，她没事，是我救了她。当然，我想如果不是因为我，她也不会陷入那种境地。

There was one final thing playing on my mind though relating to when I was taken, it was the moment I was taken. There was this huge bright light I saw, obviously the search light of the craft which took me but I saw something inside the light. Something which I had seen before, a few months ago. A person, a woman who looked like Rei Ayanami only...she was older and didn't share the same pale blue hair as Ayanami. I didn't know this woman yet there was something strangely familiar about her, almost as if she was connected to me.  
然而，我心中还有一个最后的疑问，与被带走的那一刻有关。我看到了一束巨大的明亮光线，显然是那艘带走我的飞行器的探照灯，但在那光线中，我看到了一些东西。一些我几个月前见过的事物。一个人，一个女人，她看起来像绫波零，只是...她更年长，并不像绫波那样拥有苍蓝色的头发。我不认识这个女人，但她身上有种奇怪的熟悉感，仿佛她与我有着某种联系。

It's possible that because she looked like Ayanami, this is the reason I felt that connection, I had always felt a connection with Ayanami. I had always wanted to...I don't know, protect her? I don't know if that sounds strange considering Ayanami was certainly more than capable of taking care of herself, and besides, with what has happened, why would I want to protect her? However it's always been there, it's such a strong connection, it's not like the connection I feel with Asuka but this is more something you'd associate with...I don't know the way a brother wants to protect his sister?  
也许因为她长得像绫波，这就是我感到那种联系的原因，我一直觉得与绫波有一种联系。我一直想...我不知道，保护她？考虑到绫波绝对有能力照顾自己，而且发生了这些事，我为什么还想保护她？这听起来可能很奇怪。但这种感觉一直存在，它非常强烈，不像我与明日香之间的那种联系，而更像是一种...我不知道，就像一个哥哥想要保护他的妹妹那样？

I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of what I had just thought, maybe I was beginning to go insane thinking about this. Maybe I wasn't actually here, maybe I had finally snapped and was just living an illusion. My mind was here but my physical body was locked up in some institution or I was simply comatose somewhere. It certainly seemed possible, I mean look at the facts. I was supposedly on some prison ship floating around somewhere away from Earth. I was on board with the very person I was supposed to find and then he offers me the truth?  
我忍不住笑出声来，刚刚的想法实在荒谬，或许我开始变得疯狂，满脑子都是这些念头。也许我并不真的在这里，也许我终于崩溃了，正活在一个幻觉中。我的意识在此，但我的身体可能被关在某个机构里，或者我在某处昏迷不醒。这确实有可能，看看这些事实吧。我本该在一艘远离地球的监狱船上漂泊，与我要找的那个人同处一室，而他却向我透露真相？

So there I sat in Red Sector A waiting patiently like a dog would wait for a master. I had either gone insane or maybe I really was that pathetic. Why did I even think Nagisa was going to return? It was probably just something he said to stop me trying to escape but there was something about the way he said it that made me think otherwise. Something that made me think that he was being truthful and that this time I would get what I wanted.  
于是我就坐在红区 A，耐心等待，就像狗等待主人一样。我可能已经疯了，或者我真的那么可悲。我为什么会觉得 Nagisa 会回来呢？那可能只是他为了阻止我逃跑而说的话，但他说的方式让我觉得并非如此。那种方式让我相信他在说实话，这次我会得到我想要的。

I sat up as I heard the familiar sound of the door to my room opening, I guess that meant it was time for food again. I looked up and was surprised to see it was not that but instead it was Nagisa, he closed the door behind in and stood facing me.  
我坐起身来，听到房间门熟悉的开启声，我想这又到了吃饭的时间。我抬头一看，惊讶地发现进来的不是送餐的人，而是渚。他关上门，站在我面前。

"Hello again, Shinji." “又见面了，真嗣。”

"Hi" My response was pretty feeble but how else was I really going to respond?  
“嗨。”我的回应相当无力，除此之外，我还能怎么回应呢？

"I apologize for keeping you waiting so long, I had other business to attend to regarding the Institute. Unfortunately this kept me from explaining things to you."  
"很抱歉让你久等了，我有一些关于研究所的事务需要处理。不幸的是，这让我无法向你解释情况。"

"I see." "原来如此。"

"Now Shinji I want to tell you why you're here first. I guess seeing as I promised you the truth I should tell you that truth. The truth is that you were becoming a risk to SEELE...or maybe I should say, a risk to Keel. The committee did not care so much as long as you were doing the work they needed. However as you might have guessed, Keel is not on the same page as they are. You were becoming a risk so he wanted you dead."  
"现在，真嗣，我想先告诉你为什么你会在这里。既然我答应过要告诉你真相，那么我就应该告诉你那个真相。事实是，你正逐渐成为 SEELE 的一个风险……或者更确切地说，是对基尔的一个风险。委员会并不太在意，只要你完成他们需要的工作。但正如你可能猜到的那样，基尔与他们的想法并不一致。你成了一个风险，所以他想让你死。"

So my suspicions were correct, Keel had his own agenda and wanted me dead because I was a threat. So my only question is why would Nagisa want to keep me alive? If he worked for SEELE surely it wouldn't matter to him either way.  
所以我的怀疑是正确的，基尔有自己的议程，想让我死是因为我是个威胁。那么我唯一的问题是，为什么渚会想让我活下来？如果他为 SEELE 工作，对他来说应该无所谓才对。

"The reason why you're here and still alive is because you have a destiny to fulfil."  
"你之所以在这里还活着，是因为你有使命要完成。"

Once again he was talking about my so called destiny, was this just a way of him saying 'do what I say'? Or did he mean something else. I didn't get a chance to question him before he began speaking again.  
他又在谈论我所谓的命运了，这是否只是他表达‘照我说的做’的一种方式？还是他另有所指。我还没来得及问他，他就又开始说话了。

"Humanity has such a bright future ahead of it Shinji, Keel may think he's making the right choice, SEELE might think they are but...I think they're wrong. I think that doing this will only stop humanity from growing to its true potential. Look at what Marduk achieved in fifteen years, look at yourself and Asuka."  
"人类有着如此光明的未来，真嗣，基尔可能认为自己做出了正确的选择，SEELE 也许也这么认为，但...我认为他们错了。我认为这样做只会阻碍人类发挥其真正的潜力。看看马尔杜克在十五年内取得的成就，看看你自己和明日香。"

I didn't quite understand. I imagine he was talking about the Evangelion serum but I certainly didn't feel like I was proof of any human potential. Why should I? I hadn't helped anyone with my so called power, all I was was just a tool for other peoples gain. That isn't proof of potential that's just proof of being pathetic.  
我并不完全理解。我想他指的是《福音战士》血清，但我确实没觉得自己证明了任何人类的潜能。凭什么呢？我所谓的力量并没有帮助过任何人，我只不过是他人获利的工具。这并非潜能的证明，只是可悲的证据罢了。

"The Evangelion serum could be much more than what it was used for on you and Asuka. Your mother and Asuka's mother never intended it to be used as a weapon, they thought they were using it to better humanity."  
《福音战士》血清在你和明日香身上可能远不止如此。你母亲和明日香的母亲从未打算将其用作武器，她们认为这是为了改善人类而使用的。

I thought about his words for a moment but then something else entered my mind regarding Marduk. The vaccine they were working on...what was that? It was supposed to be released around the time SEELE put their plan into place. I had to question it, "The Evangelion serum...and the vaccine Marduk is working on...are they...related?"  
我思考了一会儿他的话，但随即想到了马尔杜克正在研发的东西。他们正在研究的疫苗……那是什么？本应在 SEELE 实施计划时发布。我必须问清楚，“《福音战士》血清……和马尔杜克正在研发的疫苗……它们……有关系吗？”

Kaworou smiled and nodded, "It was supposed to be a method of control for those injected with it. A sub race of human super soldiers but completely under the control of SEELE and the aliens SEELE work with. They would prepare those not affected for a process called harvesting, turning humans into mindless slaves."  
Kaworou 微笑着点了点头，“这原本是一种控制手段，针对那些被注射了它的人。一种人类超级士兵的亚种，但完全受 SEELE 及其合作的异形生物控制。他们会为那些未受影响的人准备一个名为‘收割’的过程，将人类变成无意识的奴隶。”

So...they were going to essentially mass produce people like me and Asuka, only they wouldn't have a will of their own. They'd be puppets, mindless slaves. I had to stop this but how could I? I mean I was pretty much a puppet myself. How did I even know that what Kaworou was telling me was true?  
所以...他们打算大规模生产像我和明日香这样的人，只不过他们不会有自己的意志。他们会成为傀儡，无意识的奴隶。我必须阻止这一切，但我该怎么做呢？我是说，我自己几乎也是一个傀儡。我怎么知道 Kaworou 告诉我的都是真的呢？

"There is an island complex Marduk has, I know this is not what you really want to hear but in a few weeks Asuka will be taken there after a failed attempt at getting into the Marduk Institute headquarters in Tokyo 3. Your father will be sending both Ayanami and her there in an attempt to gather information on Marduk and yourself."  
“Marduk 有一个岛屿综合体，我知道这不是你想听的，但在几周后，明日香将被带到那里，因为在试图进入东京 3 的 Marduk 研究所总部失败后。你的父亲将派遣绫波和她前往那里，试图收集关于 Marduk 和你自己的情报。”

My father...he was going to be sending them to find out information on me? Did that mean that he wanted to find me? Or was it something else? What worried me though was that he said Asuka was going to be taken.  
我的父亲...他打算派他们来调查我吗？这是否意味着他想找到我？还是别的什么原因？让我担忧的是，他说明日香会被带走。

"Why will Asuka be taken?"  
“为什么明日香会被带走？”

"Keel is paranoid, he wants to take out the remaining Angels and at the same time remove the Evangelions. You have been taken away, Asuka will be next. She will not be killed but the process will be unpleasant."  
“基尔是个偏执狂，他想消灭剩下的使徒，同时也要销毁 EVA。你已经被带走了，明日香将是下一个。她不会被杀，但过程会很痛苦。”

"Then why can't you stop it?"  
"那为什么你不能阻止它？"

"I wish I could Shinji but unfortunately it must happen otherwise she will be killed."  
"我希望能，真嗣，但不幸的是这必须发生，否则她会丧命。"

"Then why not just send me down to stop it?"  
"那为什么不直接派我下去阻止它？"

He shook his head, "I cannot do that."  
他摇了摇头，“我不能这么做。”

I couldn't believe it, I had been brought there to help him stop Keel and his cronies, yet from the sounds of it Nagisa was just going to let them do what they wanted.  
我简直不敢相信，我被带到这儿是为了帮他阻止基尔和他的同伙，但听这意思，渚似乎打算任由他们为所欲为。

"So what? Am I supposed to sit here and watch?"  
“那又怎样？我难道就该坐在这里看着吗？”

"I am sorry Shinji, but I cannot do anything. It must happen for both her and your own sakes."  
"对不起，真嗣，但我无能为力。这对她和你自己都是必要的。"

I sighed and sank back realizing that there was nothing I could do. So what was the point of arguing about it? It was just...it seemed like Asuka had been through so much in the past few weeks, why should I sit by while she goes through more. She had been there for me yet I couldn't be there for her, it just made me feel more useless than I already did.  
我叹了口气，颓然坐回，意识到自己无计可施。那争论还有什么意义呢？只是...阿斯卡在过去几周经历了太多，我怎能袖手旁观让她承受更多。她曾在我身边，我却无法在她需要时陪伴，这让我感觉比以往更加无用。

"When Asuka is taken I will transmit the location of the island anonymously to your father and Rei Ayanami. I will also send them a gift in the form of a small platform off the coast. It is my own private platform, no one else knows about it. I will ensure Asuka does not endure more suffering than she needs to."  
"当阿斯卡被带走时，我会匿名将岛屿的位置传送给你的父亲和绫波零。我还会送给他们一份礼物，即海岸外的一个小平台。那是我私人的平台，无人知晓。我会确保阿斯卡所受的痛苦不超过必要限度。"

Was that supposed to make me feel better? Okay so I knew she was going to be safe, then what? She would be in the company of my father? How was that going to make me feel any better? My father was just as bad as SEELE.  
那是为了让我感觉好些吗？好吧，我知道她会安全，然后呢？她会和我父亲在一起？这怎么可能让我感觉好些？我父亲和 SEELE 一样糟糕。

"Why my father?" “为什么是我父亲？”

"Because your father wants the same thing you do Shinji."  
“因为你的父亲想要和你一样的东西，真嗣。”

**'The Answer Lies Within' 《答案就在其中》**

I was woken up by the sound of my room's door opening, I looked around and saw two figures enter the room. It was still dark so I couldn't see them properly, I closed my eyes again and feigned sleep. I really couldn't be bothered to talk to anyone, I was still tired and it wasn't even part of the crafts day cycle yet. Besides I just assumed that it was probably just Nagisa again.  
我被房间门打开的声音吵醒，环顾四周，看到两个身影进入了房间。天还很黑，我看不清他们，于是我又闭上眼睛假装睡着。我真的不想和任何人说话，我还很困，而且这还不是手工艺日的时间循环。再说了，我猜可能又是渚。

I had assumed wrong, I could feel them standing over me and maybe then I should have done something. If two big figures stand over your bed after creeping into your room, you react right? It would seem the part of my brain which broadcasts good old fashioned Vulcan logic wasn't functioning at that moment. Instead I kept my eyes closed and ignored them, maybe if I ignored them they'd go away.  
我本以为自己错了，我能感觉到他们站在我上方，或许那时我应该有所行动。如果两个高大身影在你房间里悄悄靠近你的床，你难道不该做出反应吗？看来，那一刻我大脑中负责传递古老而经典的瓦肯逻辑的那部分功能失灵了。相反，我闭着眼睛，对他们置之不理，也许我忽视他们，他们就会离开。

Once again I was wrong, I had another chance to react when one of them placed their hands on me. I did react, my eyes shot open and I sat up. Too late though one of them injected me with something, and I felt my eyes grow heavy as I fell asleep again.  
我又一次错了，当其中一人把手放在我身上时，我又有了一次反应的机会。我确实做出了反应，眼睛猛地睁开，坐了起来。但为时已晚，其中一人给我注射了什么东西，我感到眼皮沉重，再次陷入沉睡。

I don't know how long I was out for, I could guess at only a couple of hours but when I did wake up it felt sort of like my body was floating. I opened my eyes again and found myself stood in a small circle of light. Beyond that stretched an eternal darkness going on forever and ever. I looked around the small lit up area I was in and found nothing.  
我不知道自己昏迷了多久，我只能猜测大约几个小时，但当我醒来时，感觉身体仿佛在漂浮。我再次睁开眼睛，发现自己站在一小片光圈中。光圈之外是无尽的黑暗，永无止境。我环顾四周，发现自己所处的这片被照亮的小区域空无一物。

There was no one nearby, yet at the same time I could feel a strange presence near me. It was not so much near me but all around me. It was such an unusual feeling because it felt so familiar...almost like I had encountered it before. I took a few steps forward out into the darkness and stopped. The light I had been standing in had moved with me, that was unusual to say the least. It was like a stage spotlight except I was not on a stage.  
附近空无一人，然而我却能感觉到一种奇异的气息在我身边。它并非紧贴着我，而是环绕在我四周。这种感觉异常奇特，因为它让我感到如此熟悉...仿佛我曾与之相遇。我向前迈了几步，踏入黑暗之中，停了下来。我原本站立的光源随我移动，这至少可以说是不寻常的。它像舞台聚光灯一样，只是我并非身处舞台。

I took a few more steps and in front of me could make out the shadowed form of something. I stepped forward to get a closer look and saw that it was a wooden chair with a cello mounted against it. My cello...but that was...it was destroyed ages ago...I reached out and touched the neck slightly. It was definitely there and this was definitely mine. Just to make sure I lifted it and looked around the back. If this was my cello then it should definitely be there, a small marking on the back with my initials.  
我又走了几步，眼前隐约浮现出一个模糊的影子。我上前一步，想看得更清楚，发现那是一把靠在木椅上的大提琴。我的大提琴...但那早已...在很久以前就被毁了...我伸出手，轻轻触碰琴颈。它确实在那里，这无疑是我曾经的琴。为了确认，我将其举起，查看背面。如果这是我的大提琴，那么那里应该有一个刻着我名字首字母的小标记。

I turned the cello around in my hand and as soon as my eyes made contact with the marking I felt a hot burning sensation in my head. I released my grip on the instrument and lifted my hands up to my head. As I did so I felt something, that presence, it was stronger then before. The sensation began to leave and I knelt and reached out for the instrument again. As soon as I touched it I screamed out in pain. Something was happening, I felt something enter my mind. It flashed by quickly but it was definitely there. I wasn't imagining it, it was like a voice or text being screamed at me.  
我转动着手中的大提琴，当我的目光触及到那个标记时，一股灼热感猛地袭上我的头部。我松开了握着乐器的双手，抬起手来捂住头。就在这时，我感受到了某种存在，比之前更为强烈。那感觉开始消退，我跪下身去，再次伸出手去触碰那乐器。我的手指刚一碰到它，便痛苦地尖叫起来。有什么事情正在发生，我感觉有什么东西进入了我的意识。它一闪而过，但确实存在。我并没有幻觉，它就像是一个声音或文字在对我咆哮。

_'Who are you?' '你是谁？'_

I reached out for the instrument and once again the voice made its presence known.  
我再次伸出手去触碰那乐器，那个声音又一次显现出来。

_'Who are you?' “你是谁？”_

I didn't really know what to do, did I answer this strange presence, this voice that had somehow entered my mind? Or did I do nothing? I settled with doing nothing and tried to pick up the instrument, immediately as I did so the voice screamed out again, more intense than anything more. A surge of pain ran up my body as it shouted out.  
我真的不知道该怎么办，我是回答这个奇怪的存在，这个不知怎么进入我脑海的声音吗？还是什么都不做？我选择了什么都不做，并试图拿起乐器，但就在我这么做的时候，那个声音再次尖叫起来，比之前任何时候都要强烈。随着它的大喊，一阵剧痛涌遍我的全身。

_'Who are you?' “你是谁？”_

This time I answered back, "Shinji Ikari."  
这次我回敬道：“碇真嗣。”

The voice questioned me again.  
那个声音再次向我提问。

_'What is your purpose?' ‘你的目的是什么？’_

My purpose? What did it mean by my purpose? Did it mean my purpose being here, if so it was just as clueless as I was. If it meant...no it couldn't have meant that, I decided to go with that though.  
我的目的？它所说的我的目的是什么意思？是指我在这里的目的吗，如果是这样的话，我和它一样一无所知。如果它指的是...不，它不可能指的是那个，我决定还是这么理解吧。

"To defeat the Angels." “击败使徒。”

_'Why?' “为什么？”_

"Because they are my enemy."  
"因为他们是我的敌人。"

_'Why?' '为什么？'_

"Because they want to destroy us."  
"因为他们想要摧毁我们。"

_'Do they?' “他们真的吗？”_

"Yes they do, that's why I need to defeat them."  
“是的，他们确实如此，这就是我需要击败他们的原因。”

_'Why?' “为什么？”_

"I don't understand, so I...so that we can survive."  
"我不明白，所以我...为了我们能活下去。"

_'Because they are your enemy?'  
'因为他们是你的敌人？'_

"Yes because they are our enemy!"  
"是的，因为他们是我们的敌人！"

_'Was Touji your enemy?' '碇司令，东治是您的敌人吗？'_

"No but that..." "不，但是那..."

_'Then why did he need to be killed?'  
'那他为何非死不可？'_

"He didn't it was...that thing that took over him...it was the Angel and my father!"  
"他没做，那是...控制他的那个东西...是天使和我父亲！"

_'Why are the Angels your enemy?'  
'为什么天使是你的敌人？'_

"Because they want to destroy us, they want to get rid of humanity!"  
"因为他们想要毁灭我们，他们想要消灭人类！"

_'Don't SEELE want the same?'  
'SEELE 不也想要同样的结果吗？'_

"Yes but...I need to defeat the Angels to stop SEELE."  
“是的，但是...我需要击败使徒来阻止 SEELE。”

_'But if you defeat the Angels then SEELE will succeed.'  
'但如果你击败了使徒，SEELE 就会得逞。'_

"I know that but...if I..."  
"我知道，但是...如果我..."

_'Why are the Angels your enemy?'  
“为什么天使是你的敌人？”_

"Because they attacked us!"  
"因为他们攻击了我们！"

_'Did you try to understand why?'  
“你有没有试着去理解为什么？”_

"Of course I did but no one told me!"  
“我当然试过，但没人告诉我！”

_'So you just did what other people told you?'  
“所以你就只是照别人说的做？”_

"Yes! What else was I supposed to do?"  
"当然！不然我还能做什么？"

_'You did what your father wanted you to do.'  
'你做了你父亲希望你做的事。'_

"I didn't even know he was involved until later on, by then it was too late anyway!"  
"我甚至不知道他参与了，直到后来才知道，那时已经太迟了！"

_'Was it too late?' “是不是太晚了？”_

"Yes!" "是的！"

I was done, I was shouting at and speaking with a presence in my mind. One that was questioning my moves. Questioning what I was doing. It's words and questions were running through my mind. Why was I fighting? Was it because the Angels were our enemies? The only reason I know that was because of what I had been told by my father and SEELE. They had lied to me before, who's to say they weren't lying about the Angels. Maybe I was wrong by killing the Angels...but they had attacked us, they had caused death and destruction, how could I have just let that go?  
我已筋疲力尽，对着脑海中的一个存在大喊大叫，与之对话。它在质疑我的行动，质疑我在做什么。它的言语和疑问在我脑海中回荡。我为何而战？是因为使徒是我们的敌人吗？我所知的唯一理由来自父亲和 SEELE 的教诲。他们曾欺骗过我，谁能保证他们关于使徒的话不是谎言。或许我错杀了使徒...但他们攻击了我们，造成了死亡和破坏，我怎能就这样放过他们？

"Pathetic..." “可悲...”

I turned around at the sound of the other voice, and stepped back in shock. It was Asuka...she was glaring at me, staring a hole right through me. I looked at her, she looked as if she hadn't slept for about a week and her body...her shirt I could still see the blood stain from where Carter had stabbed her weeks ago.  
我听到另一个声音转过身来，震惊地后退了一步。是明日香...她正瞪着我，目光仿佛要将我洞穿。我看着她，她看起来似乎已经一周没睡了，而她的身体...她的衬衫上，我仍能看到几周前卡特刺伤她留下的血迹。

"You know why you're fighting Shinji...only you know the reasons..."  
“你知道你为什么和真嗣战斗...只有你知道原因...”

Only I know the reasons...but I didn't...I didn't know why I was fighting. Was it really what I thought I was fighting for? To stop SEELE, to save humanity?  
只有我知道原因...但我不知道...我不知道自己为何而战。真的是我以为的那样吗？是为了阻止 SEELE，拯救人类吗？

"You know those aren't the reasons, stop being a coward and admit it to yourself!"  
"你知道那些不是真正的原因，别再逃避了，勇敢地面对自己吧！"

"I...I don't know..." "我...我不知道..."

I said the words weakly, I was lying, the more I thought of it the more I did know. I wasn't fighting to save humanity, I was fighting for acceptance. Acceptance from the people around me, my purpose was to defeat the Angels...without that what was I?  
我无力地说出这些话，我在撒谎，我越想越明白。我不是为了拯救人类而战斗，我是为了得到认可。周围人的认可，我的目的是击败使徒...没有这个，我算什么？

"Nothing..." “没什么……”

The figure of Asuka standing in front of me answered the question for me and she was right. I was nothing without that. Without the Evangelion serum flowing through me, without the purpose of defeating the Angels I was nothing. I had nothing, I had no one. As much as I had convinced myself I didn't want to do it, I didn't want to be a puppet of my fathers...I did because it meant that in a strange way I was near to him.  
站在我面前的明日香的身影替我回答了这个问题，她说得没错。没有那东西，我就什么都不是。没有使徒血清在我体内流淌，没有击败使徒的目标，我就什么都不是。我一无所有，孤身一人。尽管我曾说服自己不想这么做，不想成为父亲的傀儡……但我还是做了，因为这奇怪地让我感觉离他更近了。

"Yet you hate your father."  
“然而你恨你的父亲。”

The figure of Asuka had disappeared and her voice was replaced by another familiar voice. I looked up and saw Ayanami standing in front of me.  
明日香的身影像是一阵风般消散，取而代之的是另一个熟悉的声音。我抬头一看，发现绫波零正站在我面前。

"Why do you hate him?"  
“你为什么恨他？”

I shouted back at her, "Because of what he has done to me, because it's his fault I'm like this! He abandoned me when my mother died! He didn't care about me he just went off to do his own thing, to plan humanities downfall and then twenty years later he only makes himself known because he has a fucking use for me! Why shouldn't I hate him?"  
我朝她吼回去，“因为他对我所做的一切，因为他我才变成这样！我母亲去世时他抛弃了我！他不在乎我，只顾着去做自己的事，策划人类的灭亡，然后二十年后他才现身，只是因为他需要利用我！我为什么不该恨他？”

"Because of his motives."  
"因为他的动机。"

"His motives? His motives! Using me, using Asuka, using you as puppets for his own gain. Why shouldn't I hate him for those motives? He just wants what's best for him."  
"他的动机？他的动机！利用我，利用明日香，利用你作为他个人利益的傀儡。我为何不该因这些动机而恨他？他只想要对他最有利的东西。"

"Because he wants the same thing you do Shinji."  
"因为他想要的东西和你一样，真嗣。"

The figure of Rei in front of me had vanished yet...yet her voice remained. Only it wasn't her voice...it definitely sounded like her only slightly older. I turned and saw another woman in front of me. The same woman I had seen when I was taken, the one who looked like Rei only...with brown hair and older. The woman I found so familiar yet...yet I had never seen her before.  
我面前的丽身影已经消失，然而...然而她的声音依旧存在。那不是她的声音...虽然听起来确实像是她，只是稍微成熟一些。我转身，看到另一个女人站在我面前。正是我被带走时见过的那个女人，她长得像丽，只是...头发是棕色的，年纪也更大。这个女人让我感到如此熟悉，然而...然而我从未见过她。

Next to her was a pushchair with a baby inside, I stepped forward and looked down at the baby. It was sleeping. The mother looked at me with a smile on her face and spoke softly.  
她旁边是一辆婴儿车，里面有个宝宝，我走上前去，低头看着宝宝。宝宝正在熟睡。母亲面带微笑地看着我，轻声说道。

"Do you really hate him Shinji?"  
“你真的讨厌他吗，真嗣？”

This woman...she knew my name and was also questioning me about my father. I nodded.  
这个女人...她知道我的名字，还在问我关于我父亲的事。我点了点头。

"Yes I do, because of what he did."  
“是的，我知道，因为他所做的事。”

"Do you know why he did that?"  
“你知道他为什么那么做吗？”

"Of course I don't, he never explained it to me, he never spoke to me. Even now he hasn't told me. He just hides behind his desk and does SEELE's work for them."  
"当然不知道，他从未向我解释过，从未与我交谈过。即便现在，他也没有告诉我。他只是躲在办公桌后，为 SEELE 做他们的工作。"

I didn't know why I was telling this woman all this, why did she even care? I didn't know her and she probably didn't know me.  
我不知道为什么要把这些告诉这个女人，她为什么会在意？我不认识她，她大概也不认识我。

"Your father was always a difficult man...he was dedicated to his cause but he was never one to open up to people. He would always try to get rid of his problems by ignoring them or locking them away."  
"你父亲一直是个难以相处的人...他致力于自己的事业，但从不向人敞开心扉。他总是试图通过忽视或隐藏问题来摆脱它们。"

Was that supposed to make me feel any better? That I was nothing more than a problem he could lock away?  
那是要让我感觉好些吗？我只是他可以锁起来的一个问题？

"So I was just a problem then? I bet he couldn't wait until my mother died just so he could get rid of me then."  
所以我当时只是个问题？我打赌他一定巴不得我妈去世，这样他就能摆脱我了。

The sound of me getting slapped by the woman echoed through the darkness. I brought my hand up to my head and felt where I had been slapped and saw her glaring at me. She didn't say anything though instead she just looked at me and then...she embraced me. She stood there and actually pulled me towards her and held me. She whispered softly into my ear.  
女人扇我耳光的声音在黑暗中回荡。我抬起手摸了摸被打的头，看到她正瞪着我。她没有说话，只是看着我，然后……她拥抱了我。她站在那里，真的把我拉向她，紧紧抱住我。她在我耳边轻声细语。

"Your father is not a bad man Shinji...remember that he wants the same thing as you and I do, even if it means distancing himself from you. Even if it meant distancing himself from me."  
"你的父亲并不是一个坏人，真嗣...记住，他想要的和我们一样，即使这意味着要与你保持距离。即使这意味着要与我保持距离。"

'Distancing himself from me.'...those words echoed around my mind as she held me. I leaned back and looked up at her face. Her eyes...her hair...it was beginning to come back to me...I realized where I had seen her before.  
'与我保持距离。'...这些话在我脑海中回响，她抱着我。我向后靠，抬头看着她的脸。她的眼睛...她的头发...我开始回忆起...我意识到我曾在哪里见过她。

Tears stung the back of my eyes as the realization was finally hitting me, I looked at the child and then to the woman and whispered to her, "Mother..."  
泪水刺痛了我的眼后，当这个认识终于击中我时，我看着那个孩子，然后转向那个女人，轻声对她说："母亲..."

**'The Moment Of Clarity' '清晰时刻'**

It had been about ten days since I had seen her, since I had seen my mother. When I had awoke from that strange dream I was back in my own room. I could remember everything about it though, from the moment those people had injected me and then seeing her. Since then I had felt a strange sense of calm, almost as if I was beginning to understand things. If it wasn't real and it certainly felt like it was then at least...at least I had something to hold on to.  
自从我上次见到她，见到我母亲，已经过去了大约十天。当我从那个奇怪的梦中醒来时，我回到了自己的房间。尽管如此，关于那场梦的一切我都记得清清楚楚，从那些人给我注射的那一刻，到后来见到她。自那以后，我感到一种奇怪的平静，仿佛我开始理解一些事情。如果那不是真的，但它确实感觉如此真实，那么至少...至少我有一些东西可以依靠。

Her words about my father were still echoing through me, I was trying to understand him, trying to understand why he would do what he did. It had been Kaworou who first told me that my father wanted the same thing I did. I hadn't really thought of it then, I didn't really want to think of anything then. Then I had been told it again and it was beginning to fall into place, I didn't have all of the answers but I was beginning to understand.  
她关于我父亲的话语仍在我的脑海中回响，我试图理解他，试图理解他为什么会做出那些事。是川原第一次告诉我，我父亲想要的东西和我一样。当时我并没有真正去想，那时我并不真的想思考任何事情。后来我又被告知了这一点，事情开始逐渐明朗，我虽然没有所有的答案，但我开始理解了。

My father didn't want SEELE to succeed, he wanted to help humanity. That was what they meant. I just hadn't tried to understand it, I had been so blinded by wanting to hate him that I hadn't tried, but even with that knowledge, the feelings I had for him still remained. Why shouldn't I hate him? Was it all right for me to hate him even though he wanted the same as I? After all I had been through it was understandable.  
我父亲并不希望 SEELE 成功，他想要帮助人类。这就是他们的意思。我只是没有试图去理解，我一直被想要恨他的念头蒙蔽了双眼，没有去尝试，但即便有了这些认识，我对他的感情依然存在。我为什么不应该恨他？即使他和我有着同样的愿望，我恨他也是对的吗？毕竟我所经历的一切，是可以理解的。

I wondered when I would see Kaworou next, there was still so much I wanted to ask him. I had so many questions about my father, about SEELE about what I could do next. I guessed I had been here for about a month, maybe a bit more by now. In that time I had only seen Kaworou twice, both times he had explained bits and pieces but not as much as I had really liked. I guess that might have been my fault though. Those times I was so wrapped up in my own self pity I didn't really ask about anything that didn't concern me.  
我不知道何时才能再次见到薰，我还有太多问题想问他。关于我父亲，关于 SEELE，关于我接下来能做什么，我有太多疑问。我猜我在这里已经待了一个月左右，或许更久一些。这段时间里我只见过薰两次，每次他都解释了一些片段，但没有我真正想要的那么多。不过，这可能是我的错。那些时候，我沉浸在自己的自怜中，没有真正询问那些与我无关的事情。

Now I had a clearer idea, I knew now that my father wanted to take down SEELE. I might not have liked him but I wouldn't sit back and let SEELE succeed. I wanted to know how I could help, if there was anything I could do. I felt useless sitting here doing nothing. Playing on my mind too was Kaworou's earlier words, that Asuka will soon be taken to the island facility Marduk has. He had reassured me that it had to happen, that it needed to happen but I still wasn't sure.  
现在我有了更清晰的想法，我知道父亲想要扳倒 SEELE。虽然我不喜欢他，但我不会袖手旁观，任由 SEELE 得逞。我想知道我能如何帮忙，是否有任何我能做的事情。坐在这里无所事事让我感到无用。加贺郎之前的那些话也萦绕在我心头，他说明日香很快就会被带到 Marduk 的岛屿设施。他曾向我保证这是必须发生的，是必要的，但我仍然不确定。

I decided to sit and wait, wait until Kaworou returned to find out what I could do. I know it sounds weird, I barely knew the guy but I trusted him.  
我决定坐下来等待，等到加贺郎回来，看看我能做些什么。我知道这听起来很奇怪，我几乎不认识他，但我信任他。

**'Knocking On Heavens Door'  
'敲响天堂之门'**

The month I had been here had soon turned to two months. The past month had been uneventful, no word from Nagisa, no more strange events and nothing happening to me. I began to wonder if maybe anything else was going to happen. I was by now longing for some news, anything from Nagisa about Asuka or Misato or the rest of them. I had probably missed so much.  
我在这里的一个月很快变成了两个月。过去的这个月里，一切风平浪静，没有渚的消息，没有奇怪的事件，也没有任何事情发生在我身上。我开始怀疑是否还会有其他事情发生。我现在渴望得到一些消息，关于明日香、美里或他们的任何人的消息。我可能错过了很多。

The possibility that all of this was just some other elaborate scheme had crossed over into my mind, that this was all just something to stop me from questioning anything. If that was the case though surely I would have been fed more information regularly and besides...I trusted Kaworou. I still couldn't explain why but the way he spoke to me, the way he told me things and the events that had happened here. I knew that he spoke the truth and that he wanted to help.  
我脑海中闪过一个念头，这一切可能只是另一个精心设计的阴谋，这一切只是为了阻止我质疑任何事情。如果是这样的话，我肯定会被定期提供更多信息，而且...我相信薰。我还是无法解释为什么，但他对我说话的方式，他告诉我事情的方式，以及这里发生的事件。我知道他说的是真话，他想要帮助我。

The door to my room suddenly opened and Nagisa stepped in accompanied by two mask wearing guards. I looked up in surprise, this was not how he had entered previously and the rifles the two guards were carrying certainly made me think this was not a friendly visit.  
我房间的门突然打开，渚带着两名戴着面具的守卫走了进来。我惊讶地抬头，他之前不是这样进来的，而那两名守卫手中的步枪无疑让我觉得这不是一次友好的访问。

Nagisa spoke, his voice not full of the usual cheer but instead was more solemn.  
渚开口了，他的声音没有了往常的欢快，而是更加严肃。

"Shinji, I would like you to come with me. There is something that needs to be done."  
“真嗣，我希望你能跟我走一趟。有些事情需要处理。”

I didn't move instead I just looked at him, I then smiled and stood up. I didn't really know why I smiled I guess it was just one of those reactions. Despite this I still trusted Nagisa, I wasn't sure why, maybe it was because of the solemn look and the two guards with rifles next to him. He certainly didn't look like he wanted to do this.  
我没有动，只是看着他，随后我笑了笑并站起身来。我并不清楚自己为何微笑，大概只是那种本能反应吧。尽管如此，我仍然信任渚，虽然不确定原因，也许是因为他那严肃的神情以及他身边持枪的两名卫兵。他看起来确实不像是要做这件事的人。

I complied with the request and followed him out of the door and through the corridors of the craft. After a few minutes of following him we entered a circular room, there were several panels and machines set up along with several screens at the front leading me to believe it was some sort of command centre.  
我顺从了请求，跟着他走出门，穿过飞船的走廊。跟随了几分钟后，我们进入了一个圆形房间，里面摆放着几块面板和机器，前方还有几块屏幕，让我猜测这里可能是某种指挥中心。

I looked up and stopped when I saw who was there. Keel...and standing next to him was my father. My father was staring down at me, behind his glasses I could feel his eyes boring a hole in me. Next to him Keel was smiling down at me and Nagisa. Nagisa spoke up to him.  
我抬头一看，停下了脚步，因为我看到了那个人。基尔……还有站在他旁边的是我的父亲。父亲正低头盯着我，透过眼镜我能感受到他的目光仿佛要将我看穿。在他旁边，基尔正微笑着俯视我和渚。渚向他开口说话。

"I have done as you asked Keel."  
"我已经按照你的要求做了，基尔。"

"Excellent, it's been a long time Shinji."  
"很好，真嗣，好久不见了。"

I didn't reply, he didn't deserve a response from me and besides I didn't have anything to say to the bastard.  
我没有回答，他不配得到我的回应，而且我也无话对这个混蛋说。

"No response, well that's okay, I understand. There is something I need from you though, Shinji. You see while you were away your colleagues have been busy and now there is only one Angel left. The person standing in front of you. The person who brought you here, Kaworou Nagisa."  
"没有回应，好吧，我理解。不过，我需要你做一件事，真嗣。你看，你不在的时候，你的同事们一直在忙，现在只剩下一个使徒了。站在你面前的人。带你来这里的人，渚薰。"

I looked at Nagisa, he didn't make eye contact instead he just stood with his head hung. I felt betrayed in a way, Kaworou was an angel? That couldn't be possible, the Angels were our enemies weren't they? So how could he be an angel?  
我看着渚薰，他没有与我目光相接，只是低着头站着。我感到一种背叛，渚薰是使徒？这不可能，使徒不是我们的敌人吗？那他怎么会是使徒呢？

"So Shinji there is one thing that needs to be done and I'm sure you know what it is. After that you can walk free, kill Kawoaru Nagisa."  
"所以真嗣，有一件事必须完成，我相信你知道是什么。之后你就可以自由了，杀死渚薰。"

I looked up at Nagisa and then at Keel. Both of them were looking at me waiting for a response but how could I give one? This was madness. Kaworou couldn't have been an Angel, it just wasn't possible. How could it be Kaworou...? I had trusted him, he was my friend and this...he wouldn't betray me like this. I shouted back at Keel.  
我抬头看向渚，又看向基尔。他们都在等着我的回应，但我怎么可能给出答案？这简直是疯狂。卡沃鲁不可能是天使，这根本不可能。怎么会是卡沃鲁呢？我曾信任他，他是我的朋友，而这种...他不会这样背叛我。我对着基尔大喊。

"No."

"Just as I expected, maybe this will prove to be an incentive then."  
“正如我所料，或许这会成为一种激励。”

One of the screens flickered into life as Nagisa stepped across to me and spoke. His voice was barely above a whisper.  
其中一个屏幕闪烁着亮了起来，渚走到我身边，低声说道。他的声音几乎只是耳语。

"Shinji...this is...this is the decision I mentioned to you when you first came here."  
"真嗣...这是...这是你刚来这里时我提到的决定。"

I turned to him and spoke, "I don't care, I'm not going to do it."  
我转向他，说道："我不在乎，我不会去做的。"

"You have to Shinji, the future of your species relies on it. I can't be allowed to live, don't you understand that!"  
"你必须这么做，真嗣，你们种族的未来就靠它了。我不能被允许活下去，你难道不明白吗！"

I did understand that but I couldn't do it, I wouldn't kill a friend again. I wouldn't let my hands murder someone because I had been told to. I responded back harshly."  
我确实明白这一点，但我做不到，我不会再杀朋友了。我不会因为被命令就去让双手沾满鲜血。我严厉地回应道。

"Then kill yourself then!"  
“那就自杀吧！”

"I can't Shinji, don't you understand? It has to be you."  
“我做不到，真嗣，你还不明白吗？必须是你。”

I ignored him, trying not to show my emotions, the screen finally flickered into life. The image of a warehouse came on and inside was a man walking around. A man I soon recognised as one Ryoji Kaji, I turned and looked up at Keel who was smiling proudly.  
我无视了他，尽量不表露情绪，屏幕终于闪烁着亮了起来。画面中出现了一个仓库，里面有个男人在走动。我很快认出那是碇源堂，我转身抬头看向基尔，他正得意地笑着。

What happened next...I don't want to describe. It happened so quickly and so easily, it was just...it wasn't supposed to happen like that, was it? There should have been a pause, or another chance for me to stop it but there wasn't. The gun shots inside the warehouse echoed from the screen in the command centre and all I could do was watch as Kaji's body fell to the floor.  
接下来发生的事...我不想描述。一切发生得太快太轻易，本不该如此，不是吗？应该有个停顿，或者再给我一次阻止的机会，但没有。仓库内的枪声从指挥中心的屏幕中回荡，我只能眼睁睁看着源堂的身体倒在地上。

That was it, he was gone so easily and for no reason. I felt sick to my stomach as the realization hit me...that was my fault. I could have prevented it but I didn't. Keel's words only echoed that fact.  
就这样，他就这样轻易地消失了，毫无理由。我感到胃里一阵恶心，当意识到...那是我的错。我本可以阻止却没能做到。基尔的话只是重复了这个事实。

"You could have prevented it Shinji and now thanks to you, Misato's child will grow up fatherless. All because you fail to see the bigger picture."  
"你本可以阻止这一切，真嗣，现在却因为你，美里的小孩将成长在无父之家中。全因你看不清大局。"

The bastard, the bigger picture? What bigger picture was there, killing innocents just for his gain? I felt a gun being placed into my hand as I looked up at Keel and then at Kaworou again. The guards around the room quickly aimed their own rifles at me so I didn't make any moves and aim for Keel. He spoke again before I had a chance to do anything.  
那个混蛋，大局？还有什么大局，为了自己的利益杀害无辜？我感到一把枪被塞进手中，我抬头看着基尔，然后再次看向卡洛鲁。房间里的守卫迅速将他们的步枪对准我，所以我没做任何动作，也没有瞄准基尔。他再次开口，在我有机会做任何事之前。

"Now Shinji, imagine if anything like that should happen to Misato, or to Agent Sohryu...I can easily arrange it you know."  
"现在，真嗣，想象一下如果这种事发生在美里，或是草薙特工身上……我很容易就能安排，你知道的。"

I didn't know what to do, did I really kill Kaworou, would I even be able to do that? Kaworou was still standing closely to me, he spoke again.  
我不知道该怎么办，我真的杀了卡沃鲁吗，我甚至能做到那一点吗？卡沃鲁还站在我身边，他又开口了。

"Please Shinji, you have to do this. For the future of your race, if you don't...they all die. At least with this...you still have a chance. From here on it's between you and SEELE you have to understand that. You can still save them, but you need to do this."  
“请吧，真嗣，你必须这么做。为了你们种族的未来，如果你不……他们都会死。至少这样……你还有一线希望。从现在开始，这是你和 SEELE 之间的事，你必须明白这一点。你仍然可以拯救他们，但你需要这么做。”

"Kaworou...I...I don't...I can't."  
“卡沃鲁……我……我不……我不能。”

He stepped closer and grabbed hold of my hand, aiming the gun near his heart and smiled.  
他走近一步，紧紧抓住我的手，将枪口对准自己的心脏，微笑着。

"You have to do this."  
“你必须这么做。”

I shook my head and tried to pull my hand away only for him to hold it in place.  
我摇了摇头，试图抽回手，却被他牢牢固定住。

"No I...I can't." “不，我……我做不到。”

Above us Keel shouted again, "What's the hold up Ikari, come on I'm a busy man. Asuka won't have much time left at this rate."  
头顶上，基尔又喊了起来，“怎么回事，碇，快点，我可是个大忙人。照这样下去，明日香没多少时间了。”

I looked straight into Kaworou's eyes and smiled, "Kaworou...I'm so sorry."  
我直视着加持的眼睛，微笑道，“加持……我很抱歉。”

"As am I Shinji Ikari..."  
"我也是，碇真嗣..."

With those words I felt my hand tighten around the trigger and then...then he was gone and I had fired the shot. For that moment there was only silence as Keel and his men left the command centre leaving only me, my father and Kaworou's lifeless body. My mouth suddenly went dry and tears began to fall from my eyes as I looked at the body in front of me. I had done it...I had killed an innocent person again.  
随着这些话，我感到自己的手紧握着扳机，然后...然后他就消失了，我开了枪。那一刻，只有寂静，基尔和他的手下离开了指挥中心，只剩下我、我的父亲和薰的无生命躯体。我的嘴突然变得干燥，泪水开始从我的眼中滑落，我看着眼前的尸体。我做到了...我又一次杀了一个无辜的人。

Next to me I heard my fathers voice, it seemed so distant though, "I'm sorry Shinji."  
在我旁边，我听到了父亲的声音，尽管它听起来如此遥远，"我很抱歉，真嗣。"

**'A Tout Le Monde' 《向全世界》**

**Asuka's Residence – 1330 hours  
明日香的家 —— 下午 1 点 30 分**

Asuka looked directly are herself in the mirror, her hands trembling slightly as she saw the reflection and spoke quietly.  
明日香直视着镜中的自己，双手微微颤抖，她凝视着镜像，轻声说道。

"I have nothing left...Shinji's gone...NERV's gone...I can't sleep...I can't eat...I can't do anything any more..."  
“我一无所有了……真嗣走了……NERV 也解散了……我无法入睡……无法进食……我什么都做不了了……”

Tears rolled down her cheeks as she felt the blade dig into her. This was the end for her, she had nothing left, everything had gone. She had failed to protect those she was meant to, she had failed to stop SEELE. All those around her had left, her friends, her colleagues...even Rei was now dead.  
泪水顺着她的脸颊滑落，她感到刀刃刺入肌肤。对她来说，一切都结束了，她已失去了一切，所有的一切都已消逝。她未能保护那些本应守护的人，未能阻止 SEELE。她周围的人都离开了，朋友、同事……甚至连绫波也已死去。

"I have nothing...I am no one...I don't deserve to be here any more."  
"我一无所有...我谁也不是...我不配再留在这里了。"

She looked down at the blood trickling from her and lay down on the floor waiting for her release. As she looked on she saw a figure enter her view, she smiled and spoke again.  
她低头看着从自己身上流出的血，躺在地板上等待解脱。当她凝视着前方时，一个身影进入了她的视线，她微笑着再次开口。

"I...I'm sorry Shinji." "我...我很抱歉，真嗣。"

**Resistance Base – 1430 hours  
抵抗基地 – 14 时 30 分**

Shinji opened his eyes. He looked out across the camp his father was taking him too. His first thoughts were that it wasn't much, there were a few tents set up and a small crowd of about thirty gathered together there waiting for them. A few of them he had seen in NERV a few times but most of the people were unfamiliar to him. There seemed to be a mix of people, though many of them appeared to be scientists, a small group looked like ex military and there were, of course, the few people he recognized from NERV.  
真嗣睁开了眼睛。他环顾着父亲带他前往的营地。他的第一印象是这里并不大，搭着几顶帐篷，大约有三十人聚集在那里等待着他们。其中一些人他在 NERV 见过几次，但大多数人对他来说都很陌生。人群中似乎混杂着各种人，尽管许多人看起来像是科学家，一小群人像是退役军人，当然，还有他认出的几个 NERV 的人。

He suddenly realized that he didn't want to be here, that he wanted to get out of the car they were in and just leave. All of them were looking at him like he was some sort of hero or saviour. He wasn't either of them, it was because of him that they had been forced into this place. He had killed all the Angels and allowed SEELE to carry out their invasion. How could they see him like this? He was a coward. He didn't have the right to be seen as anything else but that.  
他突然意识到自己不想待在这里，想要逃离这辆车，就这么离开。所有人都看着他，仿佛他是某种英雄或救世主。他既非英雄，也非救世主，正是他迫使大家陷入这种境地。他杀死了所有使徒，让 SEELE 得以发动入侵。他们怎能这样看待他？他是个懦夫。除了懦夫，他无权被视为任何其他角色。

He turned and looked in the back of the car at Asuka, another victim of his. The nightmarish image of what she had done was still fresh in his mind. It had made him violently sick when he had seen it because he knew it was his fault. If he had been there, if he had got to her earlier it wouldn't have happened. He could still see every detail, her lifeless eyes, the way she pushed the blade into herself, the way she fell to the floor and then the way she looked up at him smiling and then apologizing.  
他转头看向车后座的明日香，她是他的另一个受害者。她所做的一切那噩梦般的画面仍清晰地留在他脑海中。当他目睹那一幕时，他感到极度恶心，因为他知道这都是他的错。如果他在场，如果他能早点赶到她身边，这一切就不会发生。他仍能清晰地记得每一个细节：她那无生气的双眼，她如何将刀刃刺入自己，她如何倒在地上，然后又如何微笑着抬头看他，并道歉。

He looked out among the crowd to see if he could spot anyone he knew. It came as some sort of a relief that Misato was not yet there to see him. When he was able to force the image of Asuka from his mind it was quickly replaced by that of Kaji being shot. Something else he could have prevented, something else that was his fault. Shinji felt like it may as well have been him who pulled the trigger. He didn't even know if Misato knew about it yet but even if she didn't know how could he face her knowing that? How could he tell her about it? She had loved Kaji, he was the father to her unborn child and because of Shinji's reluctance to act she had lost him.  
他环视人群，试图寻找熟悉的面孔。幸好美里还没到，这让他稍感宽慰。当他勉强将明日香的影像从脑海中驱散时，很快又被加持被枪杀的画面所取代。这本是他可以阻止的，这又是他的错。真嗣感觉仿佛是自己扣动了扳机。他甚至不知道美里是否已经得知此事，但即便她不知情，他又该如何面对她？如何向她坦白？她曾深爱加持，他是她未出世孩子的父亲，而因为真嗣的犹豫不决，她失去了他。

The feeling inside him that he did not want to be there was growing stronger by the second. Right now he just wanted to get Asuka into whatever medical facility they had here and then leave. Or just go somewhere and wait for whatever it was that was in store for him. He couldn't help anyone, every time he tried he just ended up hurting them even more. He was beginning to feel like it would be better if he just wasn't here at all.  
他内心深处那种不想待在这里的感觉越来越强烈。此刻，他只想尽快把明日香送到这里的医疗机构，然后离开。或者干脆找个地方等待即将发生的一切。他无法帮助任何人，每次尝试都只会让事情变得更糟。他开始觉得，如果自己根本不在这里，或许会更好。

He stepped out of the vehicle and moved round to the back. He opened the door and began to lift Asuka out of the car. As he did so several people moved forward but were soon stopped by Gendo. He signalled to two of the people as Shinji looked around the crowd again. The people he signalled towards stepped forward as Gendo spoke to them.  
他走下车，绕到车尾。他打开车门，开始将明日香从车里抱出来。就在这时，几个人走上前来，但很快被碇阻止了。他向两个人示意，而真嗣再次环顾人群。被示意的人走上前来，碇对他们说话。

"Take Sohryu to the medical facility we have here, keep her sedated for now but be ready to wake her up in a few days."  
“把惣流送到这里的医疗设施，暂时让她保持镇静，但几天后要做好唤醒她的准备。”

They nodded and moved towards Shinji. He could only watch as they took Asuka away and moved her towards one of the other buildings. Shinji turned and looked straight at his father and wondered what would happen next. Finally one of the men stepped forward, one of the ex-military looking people. He addressed both Gendo and Shinji.  
他们点头，向真嗣走来。他只能眼睁睁看着他们将明日香带走，送往另一栋建筑。真嗣转身，直视着他的父亲，想知道接下来会发生什么。终于，其中一名男子走上前，一位前军人模样的人。他向碇和真嗣说话。

"We lost Tokyo 3, we pulled out anyone we could from there but it was only a small gain, I'm afraid."  
"我们失去了第三新东京市，尽管尽力撤离了部分人员，但恐怕这只是微不足道的收获。"

Gendo nodded, "It's alright. We didn't expect to keep Tokyo 3 anyway. At least we were able to recover some people. We must prepare our next move though, all of the Angels have now been defeated so SEELE will therefore be able to move with a greater force. "  
碇点点头，"没关系。我们原本也没指望能守住第三新东京市。至少我们救出了一些人。不过，我们必须准备下一步行动，所有使徒都已被击败，因此 SEELE 将能够以更强大的力量行动。"

"Understood. We were able to recover the layout for the GEHIRN Laboratories though. Hopefully this should prove useful."  
"明白。不过，我们成功回收了 GEHIRN 实验室的布局图。希望这能派上用场。"

GEHIRN...a name Shinji had not heard in a while. It was the name of the organization his mother had worked for. The organization which was responsible for the Angels and ultimately for the Evangelion serum. He had thought though, that GEHIRN stopped functioning after the Impact and all it's duties had been handed over to Marduk.  
GEHIRN...这个名字，真嗣已经很久没有听到了。这是他母亲曾经工作过的组织的名字。这个组织负责天使们，以及最终的福音战士血清。他本以为，GEHIRN 在冲击事件后已经停止运作，其所有职责都已移交给马尔杜克。

"Good work." Gendo then turned his attention to Shinji, "Shinji, please come with me. We have something to discuss."  
“干得好。” 源堂随后转向真嗣，“真嗣，请跟我来。我们有事要讨论。”

Shinji nodded at his father's words and followed him into another small building. Most likely the command centre of the camp. There was a large circular table in the centre with a few seats around it. Scattered over the table were various maps and diagrams of the surrounding area.  
真嗣点头回应父亲的话，跟着他走进了另一座小建筑。很可能是营地的指挥中心。中央有一张大型圆形桌子，周围摆放着几把椅子。桌子上散落着各种周边地区的地图和图表。

"Sohryu should wake up in a few days, I will have someone show you to where she is so you may visit her when you wish. I will also have someone assign you your own quarters too."  
"Sohryu 应该过几天就会醒来，我会让人带你去她所在的地方，这样你随时可以去看望她。我还会让人给你安排自己的住处。"

"I see, so what happens now?"  
"我明白了，那接下来会发生什么？"

Shinji wasn't really sure why he chose this of all questions to ask his father. In reality Shinji didn't want any part of what happened next. He just wanted to stay away from it all, to stay away and not hurt anyone any more.  
真嗣并不确定自己为何会选择这个问题来问他的父亲。实际上，真嗣并不想参与接下来发生的任何事情。他只想远离这一切，远离并不要再伤害任何人。

"Now you have a choice Shinji. There is an old GEHIRN Laboratory near here, it's where your mother and Sohryu's mother used to work. It is the birth place of some of the Angels and where the Evangelion serum began its life. There are some documents hidden in there by us some time ago, for this exact moment. These are Documents regarding the Aliens genetic make up and prototypes for a virus to be used against them."  
“现在你有一个选择，真嗣。附近有一座古老的 GEHIRN 实验室，那是你母亲和惣流的母亲曾经工作的地方。那里诞生了一些使徒，也是初号机血清的起源地。我们曾在那里藏了一些文件，就是为了这个时刻。这些文件涉及外星人的基因构成以及针对他们的病毒原型。”

Gendo paused for a moment before continuing, "In an ideal situation I would have liked to send you with Sohryu and Rei as back up. However this is far from ideal. Rei is gone, Sohryu is in no condition for it and I'm sure you are having doubts yourself. NERV does not exist anymore, it has been destroyed. I am no longer the Director, I cannot command you to do this. I cannot assign this task to you. All I can do is _ask_ for you to do this."  
碇暂停了一下，然后继续说道：“在理想情况下，我本希望让惣流和绫波陪你一起去作为后援。但现实远非如此。绫波已经不在了，惣流的状态也不适合，我确信你自己也有疑虑。NERV 已经不复存在，它已被摧毁。我不再是指挥官，无法命令你执行这项任务。我无法指派给你这项任务。我唯一能做的，就是请求你去做这件事。”

Shinji felt strange, his father had actually come before him and _asked_ him for this. He had actually been given a choice, but for him it didn't really feel like a choice. If he said no? Then what? He would just go and wait to die, he would let down everyone else. Even though everything inside him was telling him that he would just end up hurting everyone and not be of any use to them...he wanted to help.  
真嗣感到很奇怪，他的父亲竟然先于他来请求这件事。他实际上被赋予了选择权，但对他来说，这并不像是一个真正的选择。如果他说不呢？那又怎样？他只会去等待死亡，他会辜负所有人。尽管他内心的一切都在告诉他，他只会伤害到每个人，对他们毫无用处...他还是想帮忙。

"I...will go there, but..."  
“我...会去那里，但是...”

He trailed off as someone else entered the command centre. Shinji went numb at the sight of her and, almost immediately, the memory of what had happened to Kaji returned to him. This was one of the moments he had not been looking forward to.  
他话音未落，有人进入了指挥中心。看到她，真嗣整个人都僵住了，几乎立刻，加治的遭遇又浮现在他脑海中。这是他一直不希望面对的时刻之一。

"Misato...I...I'm sorry."  
"美里...我...对不起。"

She rushed forward to embrace him and stroked his hair gently. She was in shock that he was here, she had known he was still alive, she had known that he had returned but still seeing him there and in person was so different.  
她冲上前去拥抱他，温柔地抚摸着他的头发。她震惊于他就在这里，她知道他还活着，知道他已经回来了，但亲眼见到他，亲身感受他，这一切又是如此不同。

She heard him apologizing again, "Misato...I...he died because of me..."  
她听到他再次道歉，""美里...我...他因我而死..."

She quickly moved to reassure him, "Shinji...It wasn't your fault he...he knew what he was getting into."  
她迅速上前安慰他，“真嗣……这不是你的错，他……他知道自己卷入了什么。”

Shinji moved out of the embrace and looked at her, she looked so happy, so relieved to see him. He felt sick with guilt, how could she be happy to see him. After what he had done, he didn't deserve this. He spoke again, "Misato...I...I have to go, okay."  
真嗣从拥抱中抽身，看着她，她看起来如此高兴，如此欣慰见到他。他内心充满了罪恶感，她怎么还能高兴见到他。他做了那样的事，不配得到这些。他再次开口，“美里……我……我得走了，好吗。”

With those words he quickly left the building leaving a confused and upset Misato behind.  
说完这些话，他迅速离开了大楼，留下一个困惑且难过不已的美里。

_10__th_ _November 2015_ 2015 年 11 月 10 日

**Hospital Room – 1100 hours  
医院病房 – 上午 11 点**

"I need help Asuka...you're the only person who can help me."  
“我需要帮助，明日香……只有你能帮我了。”

He paused and sighed to himself before speaking again, his voice was quiet and weak. He could feel tears burning his eyes as he looked down at her and spoke. "I know this sounds stupid because you probably can't even hear me but I need you Asuka. I need you to wake up, to call me an idiot, to set me right."  
他停顿了一下，自顾自地叹了口气，再次开口时，声音轻柔而虚弱。他感到泪水在眼眶中灼烧，低头看着她，说道：“我知道这听起来很傻，因为你可能根本听不见我，但我需要你，明日香。我需要你醒来，叫我白痴，纠正我。”

He buried his head in his hands and broke down. "You're the only person who can do that. Please... just wake up..."  
他双手掩面，崩溃了。“你是唯一能做到这一点的人。求你了……快醒来吧……”

Shinji lifted his head and stared at her sleeping face and gently stroked her cheek. This was the first time he had seen her since arriving here. It had taken him this long just to build up the courage to leave his quarters and come here. He had been told that she might be waking up soon, he wanted to be there when she did. He wanted her to help him, it was probably selfish on his part but she was the only person he could turn too.  
真嗣抬起头，凝视着她沉睡的面容，轻轻抚摸她的脸颊。这是他来到这里后第一次见到她。他花了这么长时间才鼓起勇气离开自己的房间来到这里。他被告知她可能很快就会醒来，他希望在她醒来时能在场。他希望她能帮助他，这或许很自私，但她是他唯一能求助的人。

"You're the only person Asuka, the others...I can't face them."  
"你是唯一一个我能面对的，明日香，其他人...我无法面对他们。"

He paused as he thought about what he was saying, his first thoughts were of Misato and how he had fled the other day.  
他停下来思考自己所说的话，首先想到的是美里，以及他前几天是如何逃离她的。

"Misato scares me now, I can't face her after I let Kaji die...she said it wasn't my fault but it is my fault. I let him die, I could have prevented it just like I could have prevented Touji's death."  
"美里现在让我害怕，我无法面对她，因为我让加持死去...她说那不是我的错，但那就是我的错。我让他死了，我本可以阻止的，就像我本可以阻止真嗣的死一样。"

Another pause before he spoke again.  
他又停顿了一下，才再次开口。

"Then there's my father, I can't face him either, not now...it's just too difficult. I hated him so much, I wanted to confront him and ask why he did what he did but I can't face him, I can't speak to him. I don't know what I'd do or say, all I can do is wait and do what he tells me. I'm pathetic, aren't I?"  
“还有我父亲，我现在也无法面对他……实在太难了。我曾那么恨他，想要质问他为什么要那样做，但我做不到，我无法和他交谈。我不知道自己会做什么或说什么，我只能等待，照他说的去做。我真是可悲，对吧？”

He paused waiting, hoping for a response but there was nothing. He didn't know why he waited for a response, she wasn't awake, she couldn't hear his words. She was somewhere else, kept there by the sedatives that had been pumped into her system.  
他停下等待着，期待有所回应，但什么也没有。他不知道自己为何期待回应，她并未醒来，听不到他的话。她身处别处，被注入体内的镇静剂所困。

"I need you...I need to hear you tell me it isn't my fault. The others told me it wasn't but I can't believe them...I can only believe it when I hear you say it because I know you're the only one who treats me like I'm not a tool. Misato tries but she can't, she tries to mask it to not hurt me. I need to hear you saying it because then I know it'll be true..."  
"我需要你...我需要你亲口告诉我这不是我的错。其他人也这么说，但我无法相信他们...只有你说的我才信，因为我知道你是唯一一个不把我当工具的人。美里也试图这么做，但她做不到，她只是不想伤害我。我需要你亲口说出来，因为那样我才确信这是真的..."

He paused for a moment before continuing, "Maybe I am being selfish though, I mean why should I expect you to help. It was my fault you were like this, I promised you I'd never leave you and then they took me. I never even attempted to escape...I was pathetic, I just sat there and waited because I had been promised something. So while I sat doing nothing again they took you, they tore you apart and I didn't even try to stop it. I was even told that you were going to be taken, I wanted to help but I didn't do anything. I just took their word for it that everything would be all right and now... because of me you're like this."  
他顿了顿，然后继续说道，"也许我确实很自私，我是说，我凭什么期待你来帮我。正是因为我，你才变成现在这样，我曾向你承诺永远不会离开你，结果他们把我带走了。我从未尝试过逃脱...我太可悲了，只是坐在那里等待，因为我被承诺了些什么。所以当我在那里无所作为时，他们把你带走了，他们把你撕裂，而我甚至没有试图阻止。我甚至被告知你会被带走，我想帮忙，但我什么都没做。我只是相信他们的话，以为一切都会好起来，而现在...因为你，你变成了这样。"

He paused again, he felt a burning behind his eyes but it soon subsided, he couldn't cry any more. He couldn't feel emotion any more, he had become numb to everything. The only thing he could feel was his own self pity.  
他又停顿了一下，感觉眼后一阵灼热，但很快平息了，他再也哭不出来。他再也感受不到任何情感，对一切都变得麻木。唯一能感受到的，只有自己的自怜。

"That's why I need you to wake up...I need you to tell me the truth, to tell me what is and isn't my fault. You're the only one who can help me, please Asuka...please wake up..."  
“所以我需要你醒来...我需要你告诉我真相，告诉我哪些是我的错，哪些不是。你是唯一能帮我的人，求你了，明日香...请醒来...”

Shinji placed a hand on her shoulder and shook her lightly, "Please...wake up...don't leave me like this."  
真嗣把手放在她的肩上，轻轻摇晃，“求你了...醒来...不要就这样离开我。”

He shook her again and got nothing before giving up and turning towards the door, as he did so he heard Asuka whimpering slightly. He turned around in shock and looked at her, her eyes were open narrowly and looking at him. She spoke, her voice barely above a whisper, "Shinji?"  
他又摇了摇她，依旧毫无反应，便放弃地转向门口。就在这时，他听到明日香轻微的呜咽声。他震惊地转过身，看着她，她的眼睛微微睁开，正注视着他。她开口了，声音几乎细不可闻，“真嗣？”

He stood frozen to the spot looking at her, he didn't respond and Asuka didn't say anything else. For what seemed like an eternity he looked directly into her eyes. This had been what he wanted, he had wanted her to wake up, he had wanted her to speak again so he could tell her everything. So that she could help him. So why couldn't he say anything now?  
他僵在原地，凝视着她，没有回应，明日香也没有再说什么。仿佛过了永恒，他直直地凝视着她的眼睛。这正是他所渴望的，他希望她醒来，希望她再次开口，这样他就能倾诉一切。这样她就能帮助他。可为什么现在他却一句话也说不出来？

Then it happened, he didn't know why he did it. It only reconfirmed in his mind that he was a coward. He turned away and went as quickly as he could from the hospital room leaving her behind. For so long he had wanted to be reunited with her, for so long he had wanted to speak with her, he had wanted her to wake up so she could help him and he had ran away from it.  
然后，事情发生了，他不知道自己为何这么做。这只会让他更加确信自己是个懦夫。他转身逃离了病房，留下她一个人。长久以来，他渴望与她重逢，渴望与她交谈，希望她醒来帮助他，而他却逃避了这一切。

The only thing he could think as he exited the room were the words, _'I'm fucked up.'_  
当他走出房间时，脑海中唯一回响的词句是：“我搞砸了。”

_15__th_ _November 2015_ 2015 年 11 月 15 日

**Shinji's Quarters – 2000 hours  
真嗣的房间 – 晚上 8 点**

Asuka paused before entering the room. Her first thought was to just kick the door through and get to him that way but she decided against that course of action. It was a tempting idea though, at least it would have got his attention. She still didn't really know what she was going to say to him, just that she was angry with him. She was angry with him for running out on her when she woke up, because that was when she needed him the most.  
明日香在进门前停顿了一下。她的第一个念头是直接踹门而入，但随即否定了这个方案。尽管这个想法很诱人，至少能引起他的注意。她仍然不确定要对他说什么，只知道她对他很生气。她气他趁她醒来时跑掉，因为那是她最需要他的时候。

Then she'd heard about how he had did the same to Misato a few days before that incident, how he ran away from her and avoided her since then, choosing to either visit Asuka or stay in his quarters. She sighed and knocked on the door lightly hoping that this wouldn't be difficult and that he would answer immediately. Unfortunately it was not going to be that easy and she had to knock again, this time slightly louder.  
后来她听说他在那次事件前几天也对美里做了同样的事，他逃离美里，自那以后一直回避她，选择要么去看望明日香，要么待在自己的房间里。她叹了口气，轻轻敲了敲门，希望事情不会太难，他会立刻回应。不幸的是，事情并没有那么简单，她不得不再次敲门，这次稍微重了些。

"Shinji it's me, open up, it's important."  
“真嗣，是我，开门，有重要的事。”

She tried to sound as calm as possible, hoping that if he didn't know she was angry he'd open up and let her in and then...then she could let him know _exactly_ how she felt. It wasn't so much him running away that annoyed her, in a strange way she could understand that. It was that he was avoiding both her and Misato all because he was under the impression that if he was near them he'd hurt them. It was completely pathetic, did he just think that by removing himself that'd make everything all right? Did he not realize that they, that _she_ needed him? Did he not know or even care that it was because she wanted him there, to be there and hold her that caused her to break down and cry in front of Misato when he had ran away?  
她尽力让自己的声音听起来尽可能平静，希望如果他不知道她在生气，他会敞开心扉，让她进入，然后...然后她就能让他明白她的真实感受。让她恼火的倒不是他逃跑这件事，奇怪的是她能理解这一点。而是他因为误以为靠近她们就会伤害她们，而同时避开她和美里。这完全是无能的表现，他难道以为只要自己离开就能让一切恢复正常吗？他难道没有意识到她们，她需要他吗？他难道不知道或甚至不在乎，正是因为她希望他在那里，在那里抱着她，才导致她在美里面前崩溃哭泣，当他逃跑时？

After receiving no response she reached into her pocket and pulled out the key she had been given by Gendo. She had really hoped it wouldn't have come to this, she felt like she was trespassing but it had to be done. She placed the key into the lock and stepped on through into his room, there he was sat in a chair facing away from the door. She could make out the top of his head and also the small headphone wires coming down from his ears.  
在没有任何回应之后，她伸手从口袋里掏出了 Gendo 给她的钥匙。她真的希望事情不会发展到这一步，她觉得自己像是在非法侵入，但这是必须做的。她把钥匙插进锁孔，踏进了他的房间，只见他坐在一把椅子上，背对着门。她能看到他的头顶，还有从他耳朵里垂下来的小耳机线。

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

No response from him, she switched the light on in the room and again no movement or a response from him. She moved across to the seat quickly, now slightly worried that he did not react to the light going on. The others hadn't mentioned the possibility that he could have tried to take his own life, it didn't seem like something Shinji would do. Still the possibility was there, she had...she didn't finish that line of thought choosing to focus on Shinji instead. She had pretty much disgusted herself by doing that and wanted to move away from it as soon as possible. She didn't even refer to her own actions any more, just calling it 'that incident'.  
他没有回应，她打开了房间的灯，依旧没有动静或回应。她迅速走向座位，现在略感担忧，因为他对灯光的变化毫无反应。其他人并未提及他可能尝试自杀的可能性，这似乎不像真嗣会做的事。尽管如此，这种可能性依然存在，她……她没有继续这条思路，而是选择专注于真嗣。她几乎因为那样想而感到恶心，希望能尽快摆脱这种想法。她甚至不再提及自己的行为，只是称之为‘那件事’。

She moved around to the front of the chair Shinji was sitting in and noticed he was sleeping. She lightly shook him but it wasn't enough to wake him. Asuka then moved to the small music player sitting in Shinji's hand, she switched it on and promptly jacked the volume up to maximum. Shinji soon jolted awake and quickly threw his headphones to the floor and looked at Asuka.  
她绕到真嗣坐的椅子前，注意到他在睡觉。她轻轻摇晃他，但不足以唤醒他。于是，明日香转向真嗣手中的小型音乐播放器，打开它并将音量调至最大。真嗣很快惊醒，迅速扔掉耳机，看着明日香。

"So, are you finally going to acknowledge me?"  
“那么，你终于打算承认我了吗？”

He mumbled weakly, "Hello Asuka."  
他虚弱地咕哝道：“你好，明日香。”

"Good. So you do still know my name, I was worried you might have forgotten who I was, or anyone else for that matter, what with the way you've been avoiding us all lately."  
“很好。看来你还记得我的名字，我还担心你可能已经忘了我是谁，或者其他人，毕竟你最近一直在躲着我们。”

Shinji looked away from her towards the wall of his quarters, he didn't say anything either. This angered her, the fact that he couldn't even look at her or give her any form of an answer. She was tempted to grab hold of him and force him to look at her but didn't. Instead she questioned him further.  
真嗣避开她的目光，转向自己的房间墙壁，他什么也没说。这让她很生气，他甚至不能直视她或给她任何形式的回应。她很想抓住他，强迫他看着她，但没有这么做。相反，她继续追问。

"So why have you been avoiding us Shinji?"  
"那么，真嗣，你为什么一直在躲着我们？"

She received nothing so she asked him again, "Well Shinji, why have you been avoiding us? Why did you run from Misato when you arrived here? Why did you run from me when I woke up? Why have you locked yourself away in here to avoid us?"  
她没有得到回应，于是再次问道：“真嗣，你为什么一直在躲着我们？为什么你一到这里就从美里身边跑开？为什么我醒来时你也躲着我？为什么你要把自己关在这里避开我们？”

He finally responded with a very weak sounding reply, "I haven't been avoiding you..."  
他终于用一种听起来非常微弱的声音回答道：“我没有在躲着你们……”

"Bullshit, I'm not stupid Shinji. Misato told me what had happened, she told me about Kaji and how you were forced to kill Nagisa. She said how when she told you it wasn't your fault you decided to run from her and leave her there. Do you know how upset she was at that? She needed you Shinji, she's pregnant, the father to her child has been killed and you are so caught up in your self pitying world that you can't even face her."  
"胡说八道，我才不傻呢，真嗣。美里告诉我发生了什么，她跟我说了加治的事，还有你被迫杀死渚的事。她说她告诉你这不是你的错时，你却选择逃离她，把她一个人留在那里。你知道她当时有多难过吗？她需要你，真嗣，她怀孕了，孩子的父亲被杀了，而你却沉浸在自己的自怜世界里，连面对她都做不到。"

"I…I don't deserve to..."  
"我……我不配……"

"And then there's me, I know about that too. I'm not hiding behind it any more Shinji, I waited for you. I fucking needed you to be there when you had been taken and I knew you would return but that didn't help me. I know what I did, and I did that to myself. I have you to thank yet again for saving my miserable fucking life and what happens? I wake up and you run away, you run away like a coward. You ran away because you feel guilty, you think that somehow it's your fault I ended up like that. You couldn't stand to see me knowing that, so instead of trying to take steps to help me, you ran away from it. You think that it's so I won't get hurt or that Misato or anyone else won't get hurt but really it's just so that you won't get hurt."  
"然后还有我，我也知道这些。我不再躲藏了，真嗣，我一直在等你。我他妈需要你在被带走时在场，我知道你会回来，但这并没有帮助我。我知道我做了什么，那是我自找的。我又要感谢你再次救了我这该死的悲惨生命，结果呢？我醒来时你却逃走了，像个懦夫一样逃走了。你逃走是因为你感到内疚，你认为那是我变成那样的原因。你无法忍受看到我知道这些，所以你没有试图采取措施帮助我，而是逃避了。你以为这样是为了不让我或美里或其他任何人受伤，但实际上只是为了不让你自己受伤。"

"That's not true, I do-"  
"那不是真的，我确实——"

"You do what? You do hurt other people or you do only care about yourself?"  
"你确实什么？你确实伤害别人，还是你只关心自己？"

"I-"

She cut him off before he could respond, "I'm fed up with the others walking on eggshells around you. They're being patient with you, Misato, Gendo, the others…they're being patient but I'm sick of being patient with you. You need to make a choice Shinji, you can either hide here and be that coward you think you are, you can hurt the people you already think you do by doing nothing. Or you can get up and do something to try to rectify this. I thought you wanted to get the truth, and help people, not to hide away and ignore them."  
她在他回应之前就打断了他，“我已经受够了其他人对你小心翼翼的样子。他们对你的耐心，美里，源堂，还有其他人……他们都在忍耐，但我已经厌倦了对你忍耐。你需要做出选择，真嗣，你可以继续躲在这里，做那个你自认为的懦夫，你可以通过无所作为来伤害那些你已经认为你在伤害的人。或者你可以站起来，做些什么来试图纠正这一切。我以为你想要揭露真相，帮助人们，而不是躲起来忽视他们。”

He leapt up from his seat and shouted back at her, "And what about you? You only joined NERV and worked with me to satisfy your own ego. You're just as bad as me, you claim you want to help people and that you wanted to expose this but it was only for your own pride and ego."  
他从座位上一跃而起，对她大喊回去，“那你呢？你加入 NERV 并和我一起工作只是为了满足你自己的自尊心。你和我一样糟糕，你声称你想帮助人们，你想揭露这一切，但这只是为了你自己的骄傲和自尊。”

Asuka slapped him with as much force as she could, she immediately regretted it as pain shot up her own hand. She tried to hide it instead, focusing on shouting at Shinji, "How can you even say that, I waited for you Shinji. When no one else would, when every one else had given up hope I kept on searching. I risked my life to find you. Do think that was that was for my own ego?"  
明日香用尽全力扇了他一巴掌，随即就后悔了，因为疼痛直冲她的手。她试图掩饰这一点，转而专注于对真嗣大喊，“你怎么能这么说，我一直在等你，真嗣。当其他人都不愿意，当所有人都放弃了希望，我一直在寻找。我冒着生命危险来找你。你以为那是为了我自己的自尊吗？”

He didn't respond instead he backed down and sat in the seat again. "I might have joined NERV for those reasons, I might have kept working with you for those reasons, but I didn't start loving you because of my own ego."  
他没有回应，只是退缩并再次坐回座位。“我可能是因为那些原因加入 NERV，可能是因为那些原因一直与你共事，但我并不是因为自己的自尊心才开始爱你的。”

She turned to leave the room but stopped at the doorway, "If you want to be a coward that's fine, you can stay here and wait to die but I'm not going to let that happen to me. I'm not going to wallow in my self pity or my bruised ego any longer. I'm going to do something about it. In a few days I'm going to be investigating the old GEHIRN Complex nearby and if you wish to join me then so be it. I'm giving you this option because I care about you. Until then...goodbye Shinji."  
她转身准备离开房间，但在门口停了下来，“如果你想当个懦夫，那随你便，你可以留在这里等死，但我不会让这种事发生在我身上。我不会继续沉溺于自怜或受伤的自尊中。我要采取行动。几天后，我将去调查附近的旧 GEHIRN 综合设施，如果你想加入我，那就这样吧。我给你这个选择是因为我在乎你。在那之前...再见，真嗣。”

_20__th_ _November 2015_ 2015 年 11 月 20 日

**GEHIRN Complex – 2230 hours  
GEHIRN 综合设施 —— 2230 时**

Shinji stood waiting at the entrance, his eyes focused on the GEHIRN insignia on either side of the doors. This was where she...this was where his mother had worked. This was where the serum flowing through his veins had been partly created and where the Angels had been created. Lying beyond these doors could have been the truth about his mother that he had so desperately wanted. With that in mind though he still didn't want to enter, he didn't want to be here yet something had compelled him too. Asuka's words rang through his mind, _'I didn't start loving you because of my own ego._' Maybe that was the reason he was here.  
真嗣站在入口处等待，目光紧盯着门两侧的 GEHIRN 徽章。这里就是她...这里就是他母亲工作过的地方。流淌在他血管中的血清部分在此诞生，天使们也在这里被创造。这些门后可能隐藏着他一直渴望了解的母亲的真相。尽管如此，他仍不愿进入，不想待在这里，但某种力量驱使他前来。明日香的话语在他脑海中回响，‘我并不是因为自己的自尊心才爱上你的。’或许这就是他来这里的原因。

He switched off his flash light and waited for her to return, eventually she rounded the corner and moved up to the entrance. There she stood in front of him and spoke, "I looked around. There doesn't seem to be another way in. No other doors, no windows, aside from blowing a hole in one of the walls the only way to get in seems to be through this door."  
他关掉了手电筒，等待她回来，最终她绕过拐角，走到入口处。她站在他面前说道：“我四处查看了一下。似乎没有其他入口。没有其他门，也没有窗户，除了在墙上炸个洞，唯一的进入方式似乎就是通过这扇门。”

Shinji nodded, "I see." 真嗣点点头，“我明白了。”

Now that she had returned, his urge to leave had come back with twice as much force. There wasn't really an explanation for it, he felt embarrassed by how he had acted in front of her. He wanted to apologize but he couldn't speak to her beyond basic words. Shinji just wished he could do this alone or not be here at all. He heard her sigh with annoyance but she said nothing more to him, he was testing her patience and he knew it, but he couldn't do anything about it.  
如今她回来了，他离开的冲动也以双倍的力量卷土重来。对此并没有什么解释，他为自己在她面前表现出的行为感到尴尬。他想道歉，却无法与她进行更深入的交流。真嗣只希望自己能独自完成这件事，或者根本不在这里。他听到她不耐烦地叹了口气，但她没有再对他说什么，他知道自己正在考验她的耐心，但他无能为力。

Asuka turned towards the door and pushed it slightly, as expected it didn't open. She then withdrew a small lock pick from her jacket pocket and inserted it into the small lock on the door. After a few short moments they were in the darkened complex and one step closer to finding whatever secrets it had to hide.  
明日香转向门，轻轻推了一下，不出所料，门没有开。她随后从夹克口袋里掏出一个小巧的锁匙，插入门上的小锁中。片刻之后，他们便进入了昏暗的设施内部，离揭开它隐藏的秘密又近了一步。

Silently they moved their flash lights around trying to get a better idea of what was there. They found they were in a reception area. There was of course nothing there now but dust and cobwebs, making it look like something from a horror movie. They took a few steps forward and paused after hearing their steps echoing through the hallway.  
他们默默地移动着手电筒，试图更好地了解周围的情况。他们发现自己身处一个接待区。当然，现在那里除了灰尘和蜘蛛网什么也没有，看起来就像恐怖电影里的场景。他们向前走了几步，听到脚步声在走廊里回响，便停了下来。

Asuka whispered to him, "Maybe we should move a bit more quietly, I know there isn't another way in but that doesn't mean SEELE aren't already here. We've been caught out before by them, I'm not being caught out a third time."  
明日香低声对他说：“也许我们应该更安静地移动，我知道没有其他入口，但这并不意味着 SEELE 不在这里。我们之前已经被他们抓到过，我不想第三次被抓到。”

Shinji didn't reply he only nodded before beginning to move forwards quietly. Asuka followed him, somewhat angry that he was being so unresponsive. He had been like this since they had set off, it was as if he was scared to say anything to her or like he didn't even want to be here. Did he think she couldn't have handled it herself, or that he had an obligation to be here?  
真嗣没有回答，只是点了点头，然后开始安静地向前移动。明日香跟着他，对他如此不回应感到有些生气。自从他们出发以来，他就一直是这样，仿佛害怕和她说话，或者好像他根本不想来这里。他是不是认为她自己处理不了，还是觉得他有义务在这里？

She said nothing and continued following him until they came to the end of the corridor. There was only one door leading to a staircase going down further into the complex. This was how the complex had been described to them, a corridor up top with three basement levels. The laboratories they were looking for were on the second basement level. Slowly, they moved down the staircase towards their destination. As they moved Asuka felt something strange near her, as if there was something or some _one_ nearby. She took a look around and saw nothing, but decided not to take any risks.  
她一言不发，继续跟着他，直到他们走到走廊的尽头。那里只有一扇门通向通往更深处的楼梯。这个建筑就是这样被描述给他们的，一条顶层的走廊，下面有三层地下室。他们寻找的实验室位于第二层地下室。他们缓慢地沿着楼梯向下移动，朝目的地前进。随着他们的移动，明日香感到附近有些异样，仿佛有什么东西或某个人在附近。她环顾四周，却什么也没发现，但决定不冒任何风险。

_'Probably side effects...they said that I'd feel something strange when they gave me another shot of the serum. But that doesn't mean SEELE aren't nearby anyway.'  
'可能是副作用……他们说过，当我再次注射血清时，我会感到一些奇怪的东西。但这并不意味着 SEELE 不在附近。'_

They moved onto the second basement level and stepped into another corridor. It was the same as the one above, darkened, abandoned and dusty. This one however, had more doors leading from it, hence more places to search. There wasn't _that_ many, but the knowledge that most of these rooms would have been laboratories meant they would have to be thorough. What they had been looking for had been hidden, so that Keel or SEELE would not have been able to find it. Both of them moved into the first room they came across, it seemed like an old staff room.  
他们下到第二层地下室，走进另一条走廊。这里与上一层如出一辙，昏暗、废弃且布满灰尘。不过，这条走廊通向更多的门，意味着有更多地方需要搜查。虽然数量不多，但知道大多数房间曾是实验室，意味着他们必须仔细搜查。他们寻找的东西被隐藏起来，以免被基路或 SEELE 发现。两人走进遇到的第一个房间，看起来像是一间旧员工休息室。

Asuka commented on it as she walked around, "Seems they left some of the things here, the television and seating is here..."  
明日香边走边评论道：“看来他们留下了一些东西，电视和座椅都在这儿……”

Shinji barely muttered a response, this time Asuka didn't stop herself from commenting on him. "Shinji, why are you here?"  
真嗣几乎没出声回应，这次明日香没忍住，对他发表了看法：“真嗣，你为什么在这里？”

"To help you..." "帮你..."

"Is that the only reason? If so, then it's a poor one because you're not helping. You've barely said anything, you're just there. If you didn't want to be here then why did you come?"  
"这就是唯一的理由吗？如果是的话，那可真糟糕，因为你根本没帮上忙。你几乎什么都没说，只是在那儿。如果你不想待在这里，那为什么还要来？"

Asuka was vaguely aware that her voice was raised but she didn't care any more. Shinji looked at her and tried to respond. After a while he did, his voice was also raised, "You asked me to come here, you said you wanted me here. What else was I supposed to do? So now I'm here and you're complaining."  
明日香隐约意识到自己的声音提高了，但她已经不在乎了。真嗣看着她，试图回应。过了一会儿，他确实回应了，他的声音也提高了，"是你叫我来的，你说你需要我在这里。我还能做什么？现在我来了，你却在抱怨。"

A pause, as he gathered his breath.  
他停顿了一下，深吸一口气。

"What am I supposed to do?" he screamed.  
“我该怎么做？”他尖叫道。

Asuka sighed, "No Shinji, I wanted you to want to be here. I wanted you to want to help. I didn't want you to feel like you were obligated or had to be here. I could have handled this by myself if you wanted to sit back there and do nothing. You're no use to me if you don't want to be here."  
明日香叹了口气，“不，真嗣，我希望你是真心想在这里。我希望你是真心想帮忙。我不希望你觉得是被迫或必须在这里。如果你只想坐在后面什么都不做，我自己也能处理。如果你不想在这里，对我来说你毫无用处。”

"So that's what this is about? How much use I am to you?"  
"所以这就是问题的关键？我能为你带来多少用处？"

"I didn't mean that, it's just..."  
"我不是那个意思，只是……"

She stopped there before thinking about what she was going to say to him. If she said that would it help or make things worse? She had only found out about that after she had seen him a few days ago but it made her want him there even more.  
她说到一半就停住了，没想好接下来该怎么对他说。如果她说了那番话，是会帮到他还是让情况更糟？她只是在几天前见过他之后才得知这件事的，但这让她更加渴望他的陪伴。

"Look I know this is selfish of me but...the reason I wanted you here is because..."  
"听着，我知道这很自私，但是...我让你来这里的原因是..."

She stopped again trying to figure out how to word this properly. She never mentioned something like this to people, she never admitted she needed some ones help before.  
她再次停顿，试图找到合适的措辞。她从未向人提及过这样的事情，也从未承认过自己需要别人的帮助。

"My mother used to work in this complex just like yours did. It was around the time she died and I was sent back to Germany...I didn't want to face this alone..."  
"我母亲曾在这个大楼工作，就像你母亲一样。那是在她去世前后，我被送回了德国...我不想独自面对这一切..."

She moved towards him and buried her head into his shoulder, wrapping her arms around him, trying to hide the fact that she was crying from him. Shinji didn't really know how to respond to that, he felt selfish. She had been right, he was only concerned about himself getting hurt and not about other people. He hadn't thought about anything else but how it had affected him.  
她向他走去，将头埋进他的肩膀，双臂环绕着他，试图掩饰自己在他面前哭泣的事实。真嗣并不知道该如何回应，他感到自私。她是对的，他只关心自己是否会受伤，而不在乎其他人。他只考虑了这件事对他自己的影响，没有想过其他任何事情。

"Asuka, I..." “明日香，我……”

He trailed off as she started to speak again, her voice breaking up occasionally as she tried not to break down…"I haven't told anyone about what they did to me Shinji, they made me see things I didn't want to see...they fucked me up...they raped my mind...all I could do was fall apart. I thought I could handle it but I couldn't...and you saw what I did..."  
他话未说完，她又开始说话了，她的声音偶尔哽咽，努力不让自己崩溃……“我没有告诉任何人他们对我做了什么，真嗣，他们让我看到了我不想看的东西……他们毁了我……他们强奸了我的心灵……我只能崩溃。我以为我能应付，但我做不到……而你看到了我所做的一切……”

"I know Asuka, I..." "我知道，明日香，我..."

He trailed off again, unable to say anything. Anything he thought about saying just sounded stupid. He felt tears rolling down his own cheeks as they both stood there in silence holding each other. He lifted up his head and spoke this time knowing what he wanted to say, "We'll find what we're looking for Asuka and then...we'll beat SEELE"  
他又停了下来，无法说出任何话。他想到的任何话听起来都很愚蠢。他感觉到泪水顺着脸颊滑落，两人就这样静静地拥抱着。这次他抬起头，知道自己想说什么，“我们会找到我们要找的东西，明日香，然后...我们会打败 SEELE。”

She looked up at him and fixed her eyes directly at his. They stood in silence for a few moments longer before leaning in and kissing each other. They just stood there kissing like they were the only two people in the world, like they didn't care about anything else but each other. Eventually they broke the kiss and Asuka smiled at him, not looking away from his eyes.  
她抬头看着他，目光直直地对上他的眼睛。他们又沉默了一会儿，然后倾身亲吻对方。他们就这样站在那里亲吻，仿佛世界上只有他们两个人，仿佛不在乎其他任何事情。最终他们结束了亲吻，明日香对他微笑，目光始终没有离开他的眼睛。

"That's what I wanted to hear."  
"这正是我想听到的。"

They looked around a bit more before Shinji responded, "We should find what we're looking for and get out back to the base. We don't know how safe this place is, SEELE could still send people."  
他们又四处看了看，然后真嗣回答道：“我们应该找到我们要找的东西，然后返回基地。我们不知道这个地方有多安全，SEELE 可能还会派人来。”

"Right, lets get moving into the laboratories then. I'll take one then you take the other one. We'll meet outside if we find something."  
“好的，那我们就进入实验室吧。我负责一个，你负责另一个。如果我们找到了什么，就在外面会合。”

He nodded as they both moved into their respective destinations. Asuka stepped into the laboratory and looked around. There was nothing here except for lab tables and empty cabinets, she began moving around the room trying to see if there was anything. She moved towards one of the cabinets and found it to be locked. She withdrew her lock pick again and placed it into he lock on the cabinet and opened it.  
他点头示意，两人各自走向目的地。明日香踏入实验室，环顾四周。这里除了实验桌和空柜子别无他物，她开始在房间里四处寻找，试图发现些什么。她走向其中一个柜子，发现它是锁着的。她再次取出开锁工具，将其插入柜子的锁孔，打开了它。

Inside was a small lab jacket, she took it out and looked at it. There was a strange sense of familiarity to it. She turned it over in her hands and knelt transfixed on the name tag...this was...her mothers. It had been left here, she studied the tag again just to make sure.  
里面是一件小巧的实验室外套，她拿出来仔细端详。一种莫名的熟悉感涌上心头。她双手翻转着外套，跪下凝视着名牌...这是...她母亲的。这件外套被遗留在这里，她再次仔细研究名牌，以确认无误。

_'Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu' '绫波零'_

She opened it up and heard something clatter to the floor, it was a small case, a CD still inside it. She picked it up, there was something wrote on the top of it. As she read the writing she felt a sense of unease in her stomach.  
她打开它，听到有什么东西叮当一声掉在地上，那是一个小盒子，里面还装着一张 CD。她捡起来，上面写着些什么。当她读着这些字时，心中涌起一股不安。

_'To Asuka...' '致明日香...'_

She didn't have any time to think about it as she heard the sound of gunfire from out in the corridor. Suddenly Shinji burst into the door carrying a similar CD Case in one hand and his hand gun in the other.  
她来不及多想，因为走廊外传来了枪声。突然，真嗣破门而入，一手拿着一个类似的 CD 盒，另一手握着手枪。

"Asuka…we need to go. SEELE found us."  
“明日香…我们得走了。SEELE 找到我们了。”

She nodded and pocketed the CD she had found. She dropped the lab coat and withdrew her own gun and moved into the corridor following Shinji. Almost immediately they were ambushed by one of SEELE's agents. Asuka was ready for it and extended her A.T. Field sending the person flying backwards. She fired a shot into the person's chest, killing them instantly.  
她点点头，将找到的 CD 放入口袋。她丢下实验室外套，拔出自己的枪，跟随真嗣进入走廊。几乎立刻，他们就遭到了 SEELE 的一名特工的伏击。明日香早有准备，展开了 A.T.力场，将那人击飞出去。她朝那人的胸口开了一枪，瞬间将其击毙。

They stepped out into the stairwell only to find more agents of SEELE coming towards them. The Agents spotted them and fired shots at them. Asuka and Shinji quickly ducked back into the corridor narrowly avoiding the gunfire. Asuka pressed herself against the wall and fired back praying that she would hit one of them. She waited a few moments before hearing one of the people speaking.  
他们刚踏入楼梯间，就发现更多 SEELE 的特工朝他们逼近。特工们发现了他们，并开枪射击。明日香和真嗣迅速躲回走廊，险险避开了枪林弹雨。明日香紧贴着墙壁，回击祈祷能击中其中一个。她等待片刻，直到听见其中一人的说话声。

"We have located Sohryu and Ikari and are attempting to bring them in now."  
"我们已经定位了双龙和碇，正在尝试将他们带回。"

There was a pause before they spoke again.  
他们停顿了一下，然后再次开口。

"Okay understood, we will proceed as you wish."  
"明白了，我们会按照您的意愿行事。"

That was her chance, Asuka spun around into the stairwell and aimed at where the voice was coming from. She held her breath as she walked up the darkened stairwell, Shinji following closely behind her. Eventually they got back up to where they had entered the complex. Not taking any chances they made their way down the corridor making sure to look all around them and stay as silent as possible.  
那是她的机会，明日香转身进入楼梯间，瞄准声音传来的方向。她在黑暗的楼梯间里屏住呼吸，小心翼翼地向上走，真嗣紧随其后。最终，他们回到了进入大楼的地方。为了不冒险，他们沿着走廊小心翼翼地前行，确保四处张望，尽可能保持安静。

A few moments later they were back outside the complex with no sign of anyone nearby, the outline of their own vehicle could be made out in the distance. Without thinking they quickly ran towards the vehicle and checked around before getting inside.  
片刻之后，他们已经回到了大楼外，附近没有任何人的迹象，远处隐约可见他们自己的车辆轮廓。他们毫不犹豫地迅速跑向车辆，四处检查后才进入车内。

Asuka looked around before pulling away, "Too easy...what are they playing at?"  
明日香环顾四周后启动车辆，心想：“太容易了...他们到底在玩什么花样？”

Shinji shook his head, "I don't know...we should get back as quickly as possible. I'm sure they'll want to know what happened here."  
真嗣摇了摇头，“我不知道……我们应该尽快回去。我相信他们会想知道这里发生了什么。”

"Agreed lets-" “同意，我们——”

She was cut off as the complex they were just in erupted in a ball of flame. The two of them looked on as debris was sent flying everywhere. As they drove away the realization hit them, they could have been inside that. At any moment that could have happened but they were spared. Was it pure luck or something else?  
她话音未落，他们刚刚所在的建筑突然爆炸，化作一团火球。两人目睹着四处飞散的碎片。当他们驾车离开时，一个念头击中了他们：他们本可能就在那里面。那一刻随时可能发生，但他们却幸免于难。这是纯粹的运气，还是别的什么？

_21__st_ _November 2015_ 2015 年 11 月 21 日

**Asuka's Quarters 明日香的小屋**

Asuka sat at the desk holding the CD in her hand. She studied the handwriting on it. It was only two words but the handwriting was so similar to her own. If this was indeed from her mother, Asuka wondered what was on it. It had been hidden away for her to find, no doubt her mother expected something to happen, so she' hid it, but it was just by quirk of chance that Asuka had found it. The other question was why was it hidden, what had her mother put on it that she only wanted Asuka to see?  
明日香坐在桌前，手中握着那张 CD。她仔细研究着上面的笔迹。虽然只有两个字，但那笔迹与她自己的如此相似。如果这确实是来自她的母亲，明日香不禁好奇里面藏着什么。它被藏起来等待她发现，无疑她的母亲预料到了某些事情，所以将其隐藏，但明日香能找到它纯属偶然。另一个问题是，为什么要隐藏它，她的母亲在里面放了什么，只希望明日香能看到？

Carefully she extracted the CD from it's case and placed it into the computer. She waited for something to load up, eventually a folder popped up containing one video file. Asuka stared at the title for a few moments, the title almost seemed to confirm one thing. Her mother knew she was going to die...the file was named _'Final Message.'_  
她小心翼翼地从盒子里取出 CD，放入电脑中。她等待着什么加载出来，最终一个文件夹弹出，里面包含一个视频文件。明日香盯着标题看了好一会儿，这个标题似乎证实了一件事。她的母亲知道她即将离世……文件名为‘最后的留言’。

She opened the file and immediately a new screen popped up and began playing the video. Asuka recognized the location immediately, it was the laboratory she found the disc in. This was when the complex was still being used though, Asuka could see machines in the corners of the room and various lab instruments scattered around. The screen went in and out of focus for a few moments before settling on an image. A few moments later a red headed woman stepped into view of the camera and knelt in front of it.  
她打开文件，屏幕上立刻弹出一个新窗口并开始播放视频。明日香立刻认出了这个地方，正是她找到光盘的那个实验室。不过那时这个设施还在使用中，明日香可以看到房间角落里的机器和散落各处的各种实验仪器。屏幕几度失焦又重新聚焦，最终定格在一个画面上。片刻后，一位红发女子走进摄像头的视野，跪在镜头前。

She looked pale but was smiling, Asuka felt a mixture of sadness and fear as she began to recognize the woman.  
她面色苍白，却面带微笑，明日香开始认出这位女子，心中涌起一阵悲伤与恐惧。

"...Mother..." "...妈妈..."

Almost immediately after she whispered the word, Kyoko began speaking to the camera.  
她刚轻声说出这个词，绫子便开始对着镜头说话。

"_Hello Asuka..."_ "你好，明日香..."

She paused for a moment seemingly thinking of what to say, Asuka sat, her eyes transfixed on the image of her mother speaking to her. All she could remember of her mother was the memories of her in the hospital, everything else had been blocked from her mind. It was a sickening irony that the one memory Asuka wanted to block out of her mind she couldn't yet all the ones she wanted remained blocked.  
她停顿了一下，似乎在思考该说什么，明日香坐着，眼睛紧盯着母亲与她交谈的影像。她能记得的母亲的记忆都是在医院里的，其他的都被从她脑海中抹去了。这是一种令人作呕的讽刺，明日香想要抹去的那个记忆她无法做到，而她想要保留的所有记忆却依然被封锁着。

"_Asuka...if you're watching this video then Gendo was right and my worst fear has been realized. Hopefully by this time you will have come to understand what happened here and you will understand the task that has been planned out for you. I'm not sure what stage you are at or if it even went to plan. For all I know the person watching this could be Keel himself but I have faith in you Asuka. I have faith that whatever happens you will be able to overcome it, you are a strong child, strong and beautiful and I know that as an adult you will continue to be just that..."_  
“明日香……如果你在看这段视频，那么碇司令是对的，我最害怕的事情已经成真了。希望到这个时候，你已经明白了这里发生的事情，并且理解了为你规划的任务。我不确定你现在处于什么阶段，或者是否按计划进行。据我所知，观看这段视频的人可能是基尔本人，但我相信你，明日香。我相信无论发生什么，你都能克服，你是个坚强、美丽的孩子，我知道作为成年人，你将继续如此……”

Kyoko paused again as Asuka felt a lump in her throat, her eyes stinging as tears threatened. She blinked them away and continued watching as her mother spoke again.  
绫子再次停顿，明日香感到喉咙哽咽，眼睛刺痛，泪水即将涌出。她眨了眨眼，忍住泪水，继续观看母亲再次开口。

"_I wish I was there to tell you why we did what we have done, myself, Yui, Naoko...we thought we were doing it for the betterment of mankind but then...when we learnt it wasn't we had to do something. Except I couldn't...I had you Asuka. Naoko and Yui they had fathers for their kids and they were in positions of power...they could get away with it...I wanted to but I just couldn't...I was scared. So I tried to get out, your father...he had left so I told Keel I wanted out...he promised me safety and promised that you and I would be taken care of...I guess if you're watching this now then that turned out to be false and as cold as it sounds, Gendo's words were correct."_  
"我多希望能亲自告诉你我们这么做的原因，我、Yui、Naoko...我们曾以为这是为了人类的福祉，但后来...当我们发现并非如此时，我们必须采取行动。只是我做不到...我有你，Asuka。Naoko 和 Yui，她们有孩子的父亲，且身居高位...她们能逃脱这一切...我也想，但我就是做不到...我害怕。所以我试图退出，你的父亲...他已经离开了，于是我告诉 Keel 我想退出...他承诺我会安全，承诺你和我都会得到照顾...我想，如果你现在看到这段视频，那意味着他的承诺落空了，尽管听起来冷酷，但 Gendo 的话是对的。"

Again she paused to regain her composure.  
她再次停顿，努力恢复镇定。

"_So I thought about it and I decided to leave this here for you to find. After this message is information on a virus, when we learnt what was to happen to me, Yui and Naoko agreed to create a virus that would attack the alien DNA. It was only to be a last resort, we didn't want to fight or kill but it was understood that we might have to. Hopefully if you have this then you should have Yui's part, Naoko's part was entrusted to her daughter. With all three parts you should be able to deal a significant blow to SEELE. The virus in essence is a machine, it's based on programmable nanomachines...currently we do not have the technology for this but in a few years it will be possible. The idea is that the nanomachines are inserted into one of the alien beings and it self replicates throughout them rendering them immobile...the infection will spread from being to being until an entire craft is infected and brought down...it works by attacking the unique alien organs that create the alien blood we know as LCL."_  
“我考虑了一下，决定把这留在这里等你发现。这条信息之后是关于一种病毒的资料，当我们得知我的命运时，Yui 和 Naoko 同意制造一种能攻击外星 DNA 的病毒。这仅作为最后的手段，我们不想战斗或杀戮，但明白我们可能不得不这么做。希望如果你有这个，那么你应该也有 Yui 的部分，Naoko 的部分则交给了她的女儿。有了这三部分，你应该能对 SEELE 造成重大打击。本质上，这种病毒是一种机器，基于可编程纳米机器……目前我们还没有这种技术，但几年后将会成为可能。其理念是，纳米机器被植入一个外星生物体内，它会自我复制并使它们瘫痪……感染会从一个生物传播到另一个生物，直到整个飞船都被感染并被摧毁……它通过攻击创造我们所知的 LCL 外星血液的独特外星器官来实现这一点。”

She paused for a few moments, glancing around the laboratory and then speaking again.  
她停顿了一会儿，环顾实验室，然后再次开口。

"_I don't have long left but I want you to know Asuka that I never meant for you to grow up on your own...I only hope my death did not affect you too much and that...well I know this is maybe a bit sadistic but I only hope they allowed me to die quickly so that it did not hurt you too much. Please Asuka for the future of humanity use what you find here. This is my final gift to you, from mother to daughter...remember Asuka that wherever I am, I am always watching over you...I am always with you...I love you Asuka."_  
"我剩下的时间不多了，但我想让你知道，明日香，我从未希望你独自长大……我只希望我的死没有对你造成太大影响，而且……好吧，我知道这可能有点残忍，但我只希望他们能让我快速死去，这样就不会让你太痛苦。请明日香，为了人类的未来，利用你在这里找到的一切。这是我给你的最后一份礼物，从母亲到女儿……记住明日香，无论我在哪里，我都会一直守护着你……我永远与你同在……我爱你，明日香。"

The screen cut to darkness as Asuka felt the tears rolling freely down her cheeks. She didn't make any noise however and just thought about the message her mother had just given her. This was the only thing she had left of her mother, a final gift to help her in her fight. Now she had a way to fight back, now they had some sort of hope.  
屏幕陷入黑暗，明日香感到泪水自由地滑过她的脸颊。然而，她没有发出任何声音，只是思考着母亲刚刚给她的信息。这是她母亲留给她的唯一东西，一份帮助她在战斗中坚持的最后礼物。现在她有了反击的方法，现在他们有了一线希望。

She wiped her eyes only for them to be replaced with fresh tears with the thought of her mother. Asuka buried her head in her hands and sobbed loudly as her walls came crashing down, for so long she had wanted to hide away the memories of her mother. To get rid of that sickening irony that the only memory she had of her mother was of her inside the hospital room. Now she finally had something, she finally had a sense of closure. For the first time she didn't actually feel ashamed because she was crying, she felt like a weight had been lifted from her.  
她擦干眼泪，却因想起母亲而涌出新的泪水。明日香将头埋在双手中，大声哭泣，她的心墙轰然倒塌，长久以来她一直想隐藏关于母亲的记忆。摆脱那令人作呕的讽刺——她对母亲的唯一记忆竟是在医院病房里的情景。现在她终于有了些许慰藉，终于感受到了一丝解脱。这是她第一次不因哭泣而感到羞愧，仿佛卸下了重担。

She stood up and wiped the tears from her eyes and spoke softly as she looked at the screen, _'I won't let you down mother.'_  
她站起身，擦去眼角的泪水，望着屏幕轻声说道：'我不会让你失望的，妈妈。'

_22__nd_ _November 2015_ 2015 年 11 月 22 日

**SEELE Bunker SEELE 地下堡垒**

Keel glanced down at the screen and then around the room at the rest of the committee members. He smiled pitifully as their dead bodies were taken away from the room. They were becoming nothing more then a constant headache to him. Talking about going against the scenario all the time, or asking what happened to their plans. They couldn't see the bigger picture, they were going to become gods over a brave new world.  
基尔瞥了一眼屏幕，然后环视房间里的其他委员会成员。他可怜地笑了笑，看着他们的尸体被抬出房间。他们对他来说不过是持续的头痛，总是谈论着违背剧本，或是询问他们的计划出了什么问题。他们看不到更大的蓝图，他们将成为一个勇敢新世界的神。

He smirked as he corrected himself, _he_ was going to become god of a new world and not them. He was perfectly willing to let them sit as the committee still and perhaps, if he was feeling generous, give them sections to look over, but their constant complaining meant there would have been significant problems later on. He needed to get rid of problems quickly before they could get any worse. There was now just one problem left to get rid of, the problem that was staring back at him on the screen...the problem of Gendo Ikari and the Evangelion's.  
他自嘲地纠正自己，他将成为新世界的神，而不是他们。他完全愿意让他们继续担任委员会成员，也许，如果他心情好，还会让他们负责某些部分，但他们不断的抱怨意味着将来会有重大问题。他需要在问题变得更糟之前迅速解决。现在只剩下一个问题要解决，屏幕上回望着他的问题...那就是碇源堂和使徒的问题。

He had been complacent with them, maybe let them get away with a little too much. He should have had them killed when he had the chance, but it didn't matter. He would still catch up with them, there was little they could do besides hope and pray to an old god. Keel was the one with the power and resources now, sure Gendo had a few tricks...making sure his resistance was located somewhere his people could not get near was a stroke of genius...but they would not matter.  
他曾对他们过于纵容，或许让他们得寸进尺了些。他本该在有机会时将他们铲除，但那已无关紧要。他仍会追上他们，除了祈祷和向旧神祈求，他们几乎无计可施。如今，基尔掌握着权力和资源，当然，碇源堂也有几招...确保他的抵抗组织藏身于他的人无法触及之地，确实是妙计...但这些都无关紧要了。

"Gendo Ikari...it has been a while."  
“碇源堂...好久不见。”

"Keel...I have nothing to say to you."  
“基尔...我无话可说。”

"Well I have something to say to you old friend...I'm proposing we end this once and for all. I am offering a truce Gendo, you name your conditions and I'll name mine...you have one chance...if you do not take it then I will have you all hunted down and destroyed...meet us in Tokyo 3 eight days from now. I will send our conditions for meeting one hour from now."  
“好吧，老朋友，我有话对你说……我提议我们一劳永逸地结束这一切。我提出休战，碇，你提条件，我也会提我的……你只有一次机会……如果你不接受，我会让你和你的所有人被追捕并摧毁……八天后在东京 3 号见。一小时后我会发送我们的会面条件。”

_One hour later 一小时后_

**Resistance Command Centre  
抵抗军指挥中心**

The five of them were gathered waiting for Keel to contact them again. At the head of the table was Gendo sat directly in front of the small screen, to his immediate right was Fuyutsuki, to his left Shinji. Seated next to Shinji was Asuka and opposite Asuka was Misato. Gendo had wanted them all to be present during Keel's communication, he wanted them all to hear the old man's words so they could plan their next move. There was a general sense of unease amongst all of them, none of them really knew what Keel's terms for meeting would be. Whatever they were they would work in his favour, they would have to be careful.  
五人齐聚一堂，等待着基尔再次联系他们。桌首坐着的是源堂，正对着小屏幕，他右边紧挨着的是冬月，左边是真嗣。真嗣旁边是明日香，而明日香对面则是美里。源堂希望所有人都能在场聆听基尔的通讯，以便他们能共同商讨下一步行动。众人心中普遍弥漫着不安，没人真正清楚基尔会提出什么会面条件。无论是什么，肯定都是对他有利的，他们必须谨慎行事。

It was a few moments later when a sound rang out through the centre, signalling the incoming communication. Almost immediately Keel's face appeared on the screen, it still had that same sickening arrogant smile he had worn in their previous meetings.  
片刻之后，中心传来一声响动，预示着通讯即将到来。几乎同时，基尔的面孔出现在屏幕上，依旧是那副令人作呕的自负笑容，与之前的会面如出一辙。

"_It seems I have an audience, apprehensive are we?"_  
“看来我有观众了，大家似乎都很紧张啊？”

"What are your terms?" "你的条件是什么？"

"_Straight to the point, I see."_  
"直截了当，我明白了。"

Keel paused for a moment, _"Eight days from now I propose our two groups meet up to discuss terms for a peaceful solution to all of this. You will listen to these instructions carefully Ikari, failure to comply will result in a swift death for all involved. We will meet in a location marked on a map to be shown after this broadcast, you will send Agents Sohryu, Ikari and Katsuragi to this point. You may also send a number of your resistance to guard them. Once there I will discuss terms with them and them alone, is that understood?"_  
基尔停顿了一下，“八天后，我提议我们两组人马会面，商讨和平解决这一切的条件。碇，你要仔细听好这些指示，不遵守将导致所有相关人员迅速死亡。我们将在地图上标记的地点见面，广播结束后会展示地图，你要派绫波丽、碇和葛城前往该地点。你也可以派遣一定数量的抵抗军保护他们。一旦到达那里，我将只与他们讨论条件，明白了吗？”

"Understood, we agree to your terms."  
"明白了，我们接受你的条件。"

"_I thought you would."_ "我就知道你会。"

Without saying anything else, Keel's image disappeared from the screen only to be replaced by the map and marked location he promised. Gendo noted down the location on the map and turned to discuss what had happened, Shinji however, had different ideas.  
没有再说什么，基尔的形象从屏幕上消失，取而代之的是他承诺的地图和标记位置。碇源堂记下了地图上的位置，转身讨论刚刚发生的事情，但真嗣却有不同的想法。

"We're actually agreeing to this?"  
“我们真的同意这个吗？”

Gendo nodded and folded his hands up in front of his face, "Yes Shinji we are, we have little choice. This camp only serves to protect us from alien invaders, by that time Keel will no doubt have amassed a small number of human slaves."  
源堂点头，双手交叉在脸前，“是的，真嗣，我们别无选择。这个营地只是为了保护我们免受外星入侵者，到那时基尔无疑会聚集一小批人类奴隶。”

Shinji stood and responded his, voice rose slightly, "That doesn't mean we should have agreed, we have the virus details now, why are we even communicating with him?"  
真嗣站起来回应，声音略微提高，“这并不意味着我们应该同意，我们现在已经有病毒的详细资料了，为什么还要和他沟通？”

"Because the virus won't be ready until after that date, you know that." Asuka explained to him.  
"因为病毒在那日期之后才能准备好，你知道的。" 明日香向他解释道。

"You needn't worry about Katsuragi's life either Shinji, we will have her placed under special protection. Keel will have no objections and it is unlikely that even he will target a pregnant woman."  
"你也不必担心葛城小姐的安全，真嗣，我们会将她置于特殊保护之下。基尔不会有异议，而且他也不太可能对一个孕妇下手。"

Shinji sat back down and felt Asuka's hand gripping his as he struggled to come to terms with what was happening. He didn't want to risk Misato's life like this, he knew nothing good could come of it and the others should have known this too. What if fighting broke out? She was hardly in a position to fight back. Everyone was looking at him waiting for him to say something, waiting for him to agree. He felt it was pointless, why would they need to wait for him, their minds were already made. He nodded anyway, "Fine, I'll agree to it but I want Misato guarded properly."  
真嗣坐回原位，感觉到明日香的手紧握着他的，他努力接受正在发生的事情。他不想这样冒险危及美里小姐的生命，他知道这样做不会有好结果，其他人也应该明白这一点。万一发生战斗怎么办？她几乎无法自卫。所有人都看着他，等待他说些什么，等待他同意。他觉得这毫无意义，为什么他们需要等他，他们的决定已经做出了。尽管如此，他还是点了点头，"好吧，我同意，但我要美里得到妥善的保护。"

"She will be." “她会的。”

_30__th_ _November 2015_ 2015 年 11 月 30 日

**Ruins of Tokyo 3 东京 3 号废墟**

Shinji peered through the windscreen over at the small group getting out of the helicopter, to his left was the place he had once called home. The now derelict and ruined city of Tokyo 3, broken skyscrapers, crashed aircraft and piles of motor vehicles littered the landscape. What had once been a proud and vibrant city had now been laid to ruin in an event which had lasted all of eight days. The small group spread out as Shinji spotted Keel in the middle of them. Immediately he turned to Asuka, voicing his distaste for the situation.  
真嗣透过挡风玻璃望向从直升机上下来的小团体，他的左边是他曾经称之为家的地方。如今，这座废弃且破败的第三新东京市，断裂的摩天大楼、坠毁的飞机和成堆的汽车残骸遍布视野。曾经骄傲而充满活力的城市，在仅仅八天的灾难中化为废墟。小团体分散开来，真嗣在其中发现了基尔的身影。他立刻转向明日香，表达对当前局势的不满。

"I don't trust this at all, Keel cannot be trusted. I don't know why my father even agreed to this."  
“我完全不信任这一切，基尔不可信。我不知道我父亲为什么会同意这种事。”

Misato leaned in through the side window and responded, "Your father knows that, he has everything planned out should something go wrong."  
美里从侧窗探进头来回应道：“你父亲心里有数，如果出了什么差错，他早已计划好一切。”

"So he said but I still don't like it. Why would Keel agree to meet up here?"  
"他虽这么说，我还是不喜欢。基尔怎么会同意在这里见面？"

"I don't know but he requested he meets with you and Asuka. Everything is going to be alright, don't worry about it."  
"我不清楚，但他要求与你和明日香见面。一切都会没事的，别担心。"

"I'll try not to." "我会尽量不担心的。"

Shinji stepped out of the car quickly followed by Asuka. They moved in towards where Keel was waiting for them. The people surrounding Keel immediately aimed their weapons at the two of them but Keel raised his hands signalling them to lower the weapons.  
真嗣迅速下车，紧随其后的是明日香。他们向基尔等待的地方靠近。围绕在基尔周围的人们立刻将武器对准了他们两人，但基尔举起双手示意他们放下武器。

"Shinji Ikari and Asuka Langley Sohryu, the three of us meet again."  
“碇真嗣和惣流·明日香·兰格雷，我们三人又见面了。”

Asuka shouted back at him, "What is it you want Keel? We don't want to fight we want to put an end to this."  
明日香朝他喊道：“基尔，你到底想要什么？我们不想战斗，我们想要结束这一切。”

"That's good because I'm here to offer just that. We can put an end to this peacefully without unnecessary bloodshed. We can offer you and your people sanctuary, a place to stay and live freely...we'll even let you take other people into your community. We just ask one thing."  
那太好了，因为我正是为此而来。我们可以和平地结束这一切，避免不必要的流血。我们可以为你们和你们的人民提供庇护所，一个自由居住的地方……我们甚至允许你们接纳其他人加入你们的社区。我们只请求一件事。

Shinji didn't like the sound of it, he didn't want them to live under constant scrutiny, that would be just as bad as the way they were now. He wanted the colonization to stop, to cease for them to leave Earth.  
真嗣不喜欢这个提议，他不希望他们生活在持续的监视下，那将和他们现在的处境一样糟糕。他希望殖民活动停止，希望他们离开地球。

"What would that be?" “那会是什么呢？”

Keel pointed past Asuka and Shinji, they turned and saw he was pointing a visibly shocked Misato. His words froze them to the spot, "We want her and the child she carries."  
基尔指向明日香和真嗣身后，他们转身看到他正指向明显震惊的美里。他的话让他们僵在原地，“我们要她和她腹中的孩子。”

Shinji looked at him defiantly and responded, "That's not going to happen."  
真嗣挑衅地看着他，回应道：“那是不可能的。”

"That's a shame, In which case I guess you leave us no choice."  
“真是遗憾，那样的话，我们似乎别无选择了。”

As soon as he finished speaking the first shot was fired, one of the men guarding Shinji fell to the ground. The scene descended into complete chaos as Asuka dragged Shinji towards the nearest cover.  
他话音刚落，第一枪就响了，守卫真嗣的一名男子应声倒地。场面瞬间陷入一片混乱，明日香拽着真嗣朝最近的掩体奔去。

Shinji shouted over the gunfire as he realized Asuka was taking him towards the vehicles, "Asuka, what are you doing?"  
枪林弹雨中，真嗣大声喊道，他意识到明日香正带着他向车辆跑去，“明日香，你在干什么？”

"We need to get back to the base!"  
“我们需要返回基地！”

"We can't just leave it like this."  
“我们不能就这样置之不理。”

Shinji extended his A.T. Field to try to deflect some of the bullets only to find them going straight through. Asuka withdrew her gun and fired at the SEELE Agents moving towards them, she took down two of them before having to reload. Unable to reload before the remaining one got closer she launched herself at the Agent sending them both clattering to the floor.  
真嗣展开了他的 A.T.力场，试图挡开一些子弹，却发现它们径直穿透而过。明日香收起枪，对着向他们逼近的 SEELE 特工开火，她轻松击倒了两个，但在重新装弹之前，剩下的一个已经逼近。来不及装弹的她猛地扑向那名特工，两人一起摔倒在地。

Shinji stood up firing at more oncoming Agents taking them down with ease before feeling someone grabbing hold of him. He heard Misato's voice shouting at him, "Shinji we have to go come on."  
真嗣站起身来，对着更多逼近的特工开火，轻松将他们击倒，却突然感到有人抓住了他。他听到美里在喊：“真嗣，我们得走了，快点！”

"What about Asuka?" “那明日香怎么办？”

Asuka shouted back as she fought off the other Agent.  
明日香一边与另一名特工搏斗，一边大声回应。

"I'll be fine, get Misato back to the camp. I'll meet you there."  
“我会没事的，把美里带回营地。我们那里见。”

Shinji turned around just as another shot rang out, he threw himself to the floor trying to dodge it but felt it graze past his shoulder. Screaming out in pain he fired back at the Agent bringing them down and then got back up. He grabbed hold of Misato as they both made their way towards the waiting vehicle. Shinji helped Misato into the passenger side but when he withdrew his hand he looked down. He felt sick as he saw the blood tricking down his hand and even more so when he saw the same blood trickling down Misato's jacket.  
真嗣刚一转身，又一声枪响传来，他扑倒在地试图躲避，却感到子弹擦过肩膀。他痛苦地尖叫着，向那名特工还击，将其击倒后站起身来。他抓住美里，两人一起向等候的车辆走去。真嗣帮美里坐进副驾驶座，但当他抽回手时，低头一看。他感到一阵恶心，只见手上血流如注，更让他心惊的是，同样的血迹正从美里的夹克上渗出。

"Misato, you're..." "美里，你..."

She nodded, "I know Shinji...I'll be alright...please...just get us back."  
她点点头，"我知道，真嗣...我会没事的...请...带我们回去。"

She smiled at him but all he could do was stay frozen to the spot, he was unable to move. She wasn't alright, by the time they got back to the camp Misato would be...he didn't want to think about that. This was the woman who had been pretty much a mother to him for the last thirteen years. He couldn't let her die like this.  
她对他微笑，但他只能僵在原地，动弹不得。她并不好，等他们回到营地时，美里会...他不愿去想那后果。这位女士在过去十三年里几乎就是他的母亲。他不能让她就这样死去。

"I'm not going to let you die Misato, not here...not like this."  
"我不会让你死在这里的，美里，绝不会这样。"

He quickly moved back around to the driver's side and started the car, just as he did so a huge green flash lit up the sky. It was immediately followed by several other green flashes, he looked up as the familiar roar of the alien crafts filled the area. He started up the engine as he saw Asuka running towards the vehicle, she dived into the back and shouted.  
他迅速绕回到驾驶座一侧，启动了汽车，就在这时，一道巨大的绿色闪光点亮了天空。紧接着又是几道绿色闪光，他抬头望去，熟悉的异形飞船轰鸣声充斥着四周。他发动引擎，看到明日香正朝车辆跑来，她一跃进入后座，大声喊道。

"I thought I told you to get out of here."  
"我以为我告诉过你离开这里。"

"I know but Misato...she's..."  
"我知道，但美里...她..."

He turned to look at her, nausea swept over him as he saw her lifeless body slumped forward.  
他转头看向她，看到她毫无生气的身体向前瘫倒，一阵恶心感涌上心头。

**Resistance Base 抵抗基地**

He rounded the corner and continued straight on. For a brief moment he paused, thinking he could hear a low rumbling in the distance. Quickly he calmed himself down. There was nothing there, just like the last time he'd thought he'd heard something and the time before that and the time before that. It was just his nerves, he thought to himself, high tension brought on by days of patrolling and drinking too much caffeine.  
他转过拐角，继续直行。有那么一瞬间，他停了下来，以为自己能听到远处低沉的隆隆声。他很快让自己平静下来。那里什么也没有，就像上次他以为听到什么声音，还有上上次和上上上次一样。这只是他的神经紧张，他想，这是由于连续几天的巡逻和喝了太多咖啡因引起的紧张情绪。

He stopped as he got to the camp entrance and sat down, yawning as he did so. He wondered how long he would have to keep doing this. Of course he knew the reasons why, after all it had only been a matter of days since the incident in Tokyo 3 and it was firmly etched into his mind. So many questions had arisen from that incident. Some about himself and some about those on the other side, why did they agree to it? Why was Keel so quick to attack? What significance did Misato's child have to this whole scenario? Why did he agree to let Misato join them on that trip? Was it because he really believed Keel wanted a peaceful solution or was it just because that was the easiest option?  
他走到营地入口时停了下来，坐下并打了个哈欠。他不知道自己还得这样坚持多久。当然，他明白其中的缘由，毕竟那场发生在第三新东京市的事件才过去几天，至今仍深深烙印在他的脑海中。那次事件引发了许多疑问，有些关于他自己，有些则关于对方，他们为何同意这样做？基尔为何如此迅速地发动攻击？美里的小孩在这整个局面中有什么意义？他为何同意让美里加入那次旅行？是因为他真的相信基尔寻求和平解决，还是仅仅因为那是当时最简单的选择？

It couldn't have been because of Keel. He knew what Keel was like. Shinji had expected it to have been a double cross. After what had happened previously both to himself and others, everyone should have known better. So why did they even agree to it? Was it desperation or was there some other hidden motive that Shinji didn't know about?  
不可能是出于对基尔的信任。他了解基尔的为人。真嗣本以为那会是一场双重背叛。经历了之前自己和他人所遭遇的一切，大家都应该更明智些。那么他们为何还会同意呢？是出于绝望，还是真嗣所不知道的其他隐秘动机？

_'I've been kept in the dark about everything it seems. They choose to feed me what they want and when they want. When it's convenient for them they'll tell me something or I'll discover what they want me to. I wanted to find the truth but it's not the truth, it's someone else's truth packaged up for me. When I found it it was too late and now, I'm stuck in this, people making me out to be some sort of hero who's going to lead them in a fight against Keel...all because I have some serum I never asked to have in me flowing through my veins...'  
‘我似乎一直被蒙在鼓里。他们选择在我方便的时候告诉我他们想说的，或者让我发现他们想让我知道的。我本想寻找真相，但那不是真相，只是别人为我包装好的所谓真相。当我发现时，已经太迟了，现在，我被困在这，人们把我塑造成某种英雄，要带领他们对抗基尔……只因为我体内流淌着一种从未请求过的血清……’_

He paused for a moment collecting his thoughts, there was so much running around inside him. He had never really had a moment to stop and think like this. He had either been in meetings, sleeping or patrolling around the camp. He couldn't complain about any of it, he had never complained about things like this. He knew how serious the situation was, so complaining would only make it worse.  
他停顿了一下，整理思绪，内心纷乱如麻。他从未真正有过这样的时刻停下来思考。他要么在开会，要么在睡觉，要么在营地巡逻。他从未抱怨过这些，他知道情况有多严重，抱怨只会让事情变得更糟。

_'I've always been like that though, in a less serious situation I never complained...what was the point? I would just get things done to save anybody any hassle. Even when I lived with Misato and she unfairly allocated me the chores...I didn't complain when I had the right too...'  
“我一直都是那样，在不太严重的情况下我从不抱怨……有什么意义呢？我宁愿自己动手解决问题，免得给别人添麻烦。即使和美里住在一起，她不公平地分配家务给我……即使我有权利抱怨，我也从未这样做过……”_

He smiled weakly, those memories from over thirteen years ago were still pretty vivid in his mind. At the time he had hated being there but now he wished he could go back, to a time before NERV, before Angels and SEELE, before his home had became nothing more than a desolate wasteland.  
他虚弱地笑了笑，那些十三年前的记忆在他脑海中依然清晰。那时他讨厌待在那里，但现在他希望能回到过去，回到 NERV、天使和 SEELE 出现之前，回到他的家还未变成一片荒芜之地的时候。

Shinji turned his head around as he became aware of a presence behind him, he saw Asuka looking down at him. She too was looking just as tired as the rest of them. Asuka, however was masking the look of worry that the rest of them wore. She handed Shinji a cup of coffee and sat down next to him, that was just what Shinji needed...more caffeine.  
真嗣转过头，感觉到身后有人，他看到明日香正低头看着他。她也和其他人一样显得疲惫不堪。然而，明日香掩饰住了其他人脸上的担忧表情。她递给真嗣一杯咖啡，然后坐在他旁边，这正是真嗣需要的……更多的咖啡因。

"Asuka you should be sleep-"  
"明日香，你应该去睡觉——"

She cut him off quickly, not wanting to be lectured by him, "Yes I know, but my next shift isn't until sometime tomorrow so I thought I'd see how you're doing."  
她迅速打断了他，不想被他训斥，"我知道，但我的下一班要到明天某个时候，所以我想看看你怎么样了。"

He sighed knowing better than to argue back with her, "I'm all right I guess. Just wondering how long we're going to have to keep this up before the tension in the camp goes back down. Keel can't get to us here...can he?"  
他叹了口气，知道最好不要和她争论，"我想我还好。只是想知道我们要这样维持多久，营地里的紧张气氛才会缓和下来。基尔在这里无法对我们下手……是吧？"

She shook her head, "Your father explained that there's something here that serves as a repellent to the aliens. It's what they're using to create the virus, they just needed the instructions that we managed to pick up...but everyone is so tense that they expect an attack at any moment. Us keeping watch helps them calm down, I suppose."  
她摇了摇头，“你父亲解释说这里有什么东西能驱赶外星人。他们用它来制造病毒，只是需要我们设法获取的指令……但大家都非常紧张，随时准备应对攻击。我们保持警戒，我想这能让他们稍微安心些。”

Her voice was unusually calm, there was no 'matter of fact' tone like he had heard so many times before. Maybe the tiredness was affecting her more than she was letting on, or maybe she just didn't care any more.  
她的声音异常平静，没有了以往那种‘事实如此’的语气。或许是疲惫比她表现出来的更甚，又或许她已经不在乎了。

"I have to admit, I keep on looking out all the time thinking I can hear or see something myself. What happened in Tokyo 3 has got us all on edge a bit I guess."  
“我得承认，我一直不停地观察四周，总觉得能听到或看到什么。第三新东京市发生的事让我们都有些紧张。”

He hadn't spoke about what had happened in Tokyo 3 to anyone yet, only really choosing to think about it briefly and focus instead on matters such as their next move but the memory was still there. There was no hiding from it, what had happened dealt a serious blow to them and the rest of the movement. They had only lost a small number but it was still significant enough to cause serious panic and there was of course the matter of what had happened to Misato.  
他尚未向任何人提及在第三新东京市发生的事情，只是选择短暂地思考并专注于下一步行动等事宜，但那段记忆依旧挥之不去。无法逃避，那次事件对他们及整个运动造成了沉重打击。虽然损失的人数不多，但已足以引发严重恐慌，更不用说美里遭遇的事情了。

Asuka turned to look at him not really sure how to approach the subject, this had been what she wanted to come out here to talk to him about. What had happened in Tokyo 3 and more importantly what had happened to Misato. There had been some things she had noticed about his former guardian that she thought he should know but she knew how important she was too him. If she just blurted this out then she risked angering him which at this point she didn't want. She had only just come to terms with her feelings for him. Luckily for her it was Shinji who approached the subject first.  
明日香转头看向他，不太确定如何切入这个话题，这正是她想出来和他谈的事情。关于第三新东京市发生的事，更重要的是美里的遭遇。她注意到了一些关于他前监护人的事情，觉得他应该知道，但她明白美里对他有多重要。如果她直接说出来，可能会激怒他，而她现在不想这样。她才刚刚接受自己对他的感情。幸运的是，是真嗣先提起了这个话题。

"Asuka...have you seen Misato today?"  
“明日香……你今天见到美里了吗？”

She nodded, "I went to see her earlier today, I told her why you hadn't been able to visit her yet. How your father is keeping you busy with patrolling and meetings."  
她点点头，“我今天早些时候去看过她了，我告诉她你为什么还没能去探望她。你父亲让你忙于巡逻和会议。”

"I see, she isn't mad is she?"  
“我明白了，她没生气吧？”

"More so with herself for agreeing to accompany us to Tokyo 3, she blames herself for putting her baby at risk and for what happened."  
“她更多的是对自己生气，因为她同意跟我们来第三新东京市，她责怪自己让她的孩子处于危险之中，以及所发生的一切。”

"You told her she is being silly obviously?"  
"你告诉她她显然是在犯傻吗？"

She laughed, "Of course, did you expect anything else from me?"  
她笑了，“当然，你还能指望我什么？”

He joined in laughing, "No of course not."  
他也跟着笑了起来，“当然不会。”

"Actually Shinji...I wanted to talk to you about Misato and about what happened..."  
“实际上，真嗣……我想和你谈谈美里以及发生的事情……”

She paused for a moment, waiting for his response. He didn't give any just yet, instead wondering what Asuka was about to say. He would be lying if he said he didn't have any concerns over what had happened with Misato and why Keel seemed to want her and her child. They were the same concerns that he had had when he first learnt that she was pregnant, the same concerns that had been amplified when she had been attacked by Carter.  
她停顿了一下，等待他的回应。他暂时没有给出任何反应，而是在想明日香即将要说些什么。如果说他对美里发生的事情以及为什么基尔似乎想要她和她的孩子没有任何担忧，那他就是在撒谎。这些担忧与他最初得知她怀孕时的担忧如出一辙，当她被卡特袭击时，这些担忧更是被放大了。

He finally responded to her, "What was it you wanted to talk about?"  
他终于回应她，“你想谈些什么？”

She didn't look at him, instead choosing to look straight ahead, for some reason she felt incredibly nervous approaching this subject. She had never really felt this way talking about anything but because of who she was talking to she felt almost sick with fear.  
她没有看他，而是选择直视前方，不知为何，她对这个话题感到异常紧张。她从未在谈论其他事情时有过这种感觉，但因为她在与谁交谈，她几乎因恐惧而感到恶心。

"It's just...I think there is something happening with her child that we don't know about. Something Keel wanted the other day, something that your father probably knows about."  
“只是……我觉得她孩子身上发生了一些我们不知道的事情。基尔那天想要的东西，你父亲可能知道些什么。”

"I see." "原来如此。"

She continued speaking, "I mean you saw what happened, Keel wanted her and the child and when we refused to hand them over he attacked. Misato was attacked directly, her being shot was no accident I saw it happen...and when she was shot I saw..."  
她继续说道，“我是说你看到了发生的事情，基尔想要她和她的孩子，当我们拒绝交出他们时，他发动了攻击。美里直接受到了攻击，她中弹绝非偶然，我亲眼目睹了这一切……而当她中弹时，我看到了……”

She trailed off wondering how Shinji would react to this, "I saw an A.T. Field Shinji, Misato projected an A.T. Field and her wound...she was shot...directly in the shoulder but you look at her now and there's no trace of it. She's made a full recovery, that's impossible."  
她话音渐弱，好奇真嗣对此会有何反应，“我看到了 A.T.力场，真嗣，美里展开了 A.T.力场，她的伤口……她被直接射中了肩膀，但你现在看看她，一点痕迹都没有。她完全康复了，这不可能。”

He nodded taking all of this in, the news of her making a full recovery was certainly new to him and it was only confirming his fear that Misato was in danger. He tried to formulate a response but Asuka spoke again much to his relief.  
他点头消化着这一切，得知她完全康复的消息对他来说确实新鲜，而这只是加深了他对美里身处险境的担忧。他试图组织语言回应，但阿斯卡再次开口，让他松了口气。

"I know how much Misato means to you but there's something wrong Shinji, either with her or with her child. I know you don't want to hear this but she is at great risk and I think your father knows why. Keel already knows and has gone to great trouble to get her..."  
“我知道美里对你有多重要，但真嗣，她或她孩子身上肯定有问题。我知道你不想听这些，但她正处于极大的危险之中，我想你父亲知道原因。基尔已经知道了，并且费尽心思要得到她……”

Finally Shinji responded his throat somewhat dry, "So what do you suggest we do? Are we in danger because of her?"  
终于，真嗣有些干涩地开口回应，“那你觉得我们该怎么办？我们会不会因为她而陷入危险？”

She nodded, "I think so but I think we're in danger anyway purely because of who and what we are. As for what we should do, I think we need to speak to your father about this, but not just yet. In six days he's promised to take us back into Tokyo 3 there's another lab in there that we need to go to in order to get the final piece for the virus. Once there I think we should find out what we can about Misato...whatever is happening it poses a threat to all of us."  
她点点头，“我认为是这样，但即便没有她，我们本身的身份和存在就已经足够危险。至于我们该怎么做，我觉得我们需要和你父亲谈谈，但不是现在。六天后，他答应带我们回东京 3，那里有一个实验室，我们需要去那里获取病毒的最后一块拼图。到了那里，我们应该尽可能了解关于美里的一切……无论发生什么，这对我们所有人都是一个威胁。”

**Tokyo 3 Ruins 第三新东京市废墟**

Derelict, devastated, destroyed...just three of the words that came to their minds as they looked towards Tokyo 3. It still looked as it had done a week and a half ago, it's tallest buildings damaged, abandoned vehicles littering the streets, collapsed buildings blocking roads. It was remarkable that all this destruction was brought about in only eight days. As they entered the city itself Shinji wondered if there were any people left within the city or was everybody driven out or taken just as they had been with old Tokyo.  
废弃、破败、毁灭...这些词在他们望向第三东京市时涌上心头。这座城市依旧如一周半前所见，最高的建筑受损，废弃车辆遍布街道，倒塌的楼宇阻塞了道路。令人震惊的是，这一切破坏仅在八天内发生。当他们进入城市时，真嗣不禁疑惑，这座城市里是否还有幸存者，或者所有人都已被驱离或带走，就像旧东京那样。

It was incredibly weird walking through those empty streets, at this time of the day they would usually be full of people going back and forth. Tourists, businessmen, shoppers and school children and now it was home to rubble and parked cars. There we no signs of life at all, no sign that anybody had been here since the attacks.  
在这段时间穿过空荡荡的街道，感觉异常诡异，平日里这个时间应该是人来人往。游客、商人、购物者和学生，如今这里只剩下瓦砾和停放的车辆。完全没有生命的迹象，没有任何迹象表明自袭击以来有人来过这里。

Shinji spoke, making sure he kept his voice hushed, "Do you think there are any survivors inside the city?"  
真嗣轻声说道，确保自己的声音保持低沉，“你觉得城里还有幸存者吗？”

Up front Gendo stopped and shook his head, "Unlikely, Keel will most likely have sent around mop up teams to ensure any survivors were taken by force. They most likely know we're here now and will have sent people to search for us as we speak."  
在前方，源渡停下脚步，摇了摇头，“不太可能，基尔多半已经派出了清扫小队，确保所有幸存者被强行带走。他们现在很可能已经知道我们在这里，并且正在派人搜寻我们。”

Shinji was surprise by how calm his father sounded, even in a situation like this the man showed no emotion. More so now that he knew they were being hunted down. As they moved a bit further Asuka finally spoke, directly addressing Gendo.  
真嗣惊讶于父亲在这种情境下的平静，即便在这种时刻，这个男人依然毫无情感流露。更不用说现在他们知道自己正在被追捕。当他们继续前行时，绫波终于开口，直接向源渡发问。

"Why did Keel want Misato?"  
“为什么基尔想要美里？”

Gendo didn't stop moving but he did respond immediately, "Direct and to the point. Keel does not want Katsuragi, it is the child that she carries that he is more concerned with. Katsuragi surviving the impact was not an accident, it was planned. Much like I was the one who chose the candidates for the Evangelion Project it was also I who picked out the lone survivor of the impact. At first it was because they needed a survivor, they needed someone to manipulate to bend the truth. Luckily for them Katsuragi could not speak for two months after the incident, let alone remember it."  
源堂没有停下脚步，但他立刻回应道：“直截了当。基尔并不想要葛城，他更关心的是她腹中的孩子。葛城在冲击中幸存并非偶然，而是精心策划的。正如我选择了福音战士计划的候选人一样，我也是那个挑选了冲击中唯一幸存者的人。起初，他们需要一个幸存者，需要一个可以操纵以扭曲真相的人。幸运的是，葛城在事故后两个月内都无法说话，更不用说记得它了。”

Gendo paused for a moment, as Shinji questioned him a bit further.  
源堂停顿了一下，因为真嗣进一步向他提出了疑问。

"So Misato coming into contact with me...that was no accident?"  
“那么，美里与我接触……那也不是偶然？”

"Correct, I needed you in a place where I could keep an eye on you but not have any direct contact with you. Katsuragi was an ideal candidate so I ensured you two would come into contact, Keel was intent on taking you away. Moving you to Germany where he could influence your development, fortunately they trusted me so I was able to keep you here away from them."  
"没错，我需要你在我的视线范围内，但又不能直接接触你。葛城是理想的人选，所以我确保你们会相遇，基尔想要把你带走。他打算把你转移到德国，以便影响你的成长，幸运的是他们信任我，所以我能让你留在这里，远离他们。"

"She had only just found out she was unable to have children at that time...you knew she would see me and take me in because she felt sorry for me..."  
"那时她刚发现自己无法生育...你知道她会看到我并收养我，因为她对我感到同情..."

Up ahead Shinji saw Gendo nodding, he replied, his voice as emotionless as ever, "That's right. It is a fact I am not proud of but I had to ensure my son was protected and at least able to grow up somewhat normally."  
前方，真嗣看到源堂点头，他回答道，声音一如既往地毫无感情，"“没错。这不是我引以为傲的事实，但我必须确保我的儿子得到保护，至少能以某种正常的方式成长。”

"So what about Misato, she was supposed to be unable to have children. Why is she suddenly pregnant and why is Keel after her child?"  
那么美里呢，她本该是不能生育的。为什么突然怀孕了，而且基尔为什么要追她的孩子？

Gendo paused up ahead at one of the intersections, he looked across at one of the small buildings and then turned back around to Shinji and Asuka. "We're here...that building over there, the basement level there is a laboratory. This key card will get you in. Once inside you will find a computer, activate the software on this disk."  
碇源堂在前方的一个路口停下，他看向其中一座小建筑，然后转过身来对真嗣和明日香说：“我们到了...那边的建筑，地下室是一个实验室。这张钥匙卡可以让你们进去。进去后，你们会找到一台电脑，启动这张磁盘上的软件。”

It sounded easy, it sounded too easy. Shinji took the key card and disk from his father and looked across at the building. This couldn't have been it, the virus had been created and all they had to do was activate it.  
听起来很简单，简单得过头了。真嗣从父亲手中接过钥匙卡和磁盘，望向那座建筑。这不可能是全部，病毒已经制造好了，他们只需要激活它。

"Is that it?" “就这样？”

Gendo nodded and began to walk out into the street, before he could get very far Shinji called across to him. "Wait...you didn't answer my question about Misato."  
碇点了点头，开始走向街道，但还没走远，真嗣就朝他喊道：“等等……你还没回答我关于美里小姐的问题。”

Gendo stopped in his tracks and turned back round, Shinji questioned him again. "Why is Keel after Misato's child, after all that has happened I think you owe me this."  
碇停下脚步，转过身来，真嗣再次质问他：“为什么基尔要追捕美里小姐的孩子，经历了这么多，我认为你欠我一个解释。”

Gendo smirked, "I guess I do...That is-"  
源渡微微一笑，“我想我是……也就是说——”

He was immediately cut off by the sound of a single gunshot ringing through the air. The three of them quickly ducked into a nearby alleyway and looked around into the centre of the street at the person that had just appeared. It was a single man carrying a handgun and wearing a black suit, he had the same white hair that Kaworou had and Shinji could see the man's red eyes. Was this another Angel? That couldn't have been, all the Angels had been killed.  
突然，一声枪响划破空气，打断了他的话。三人迅速躲进附近的一条小巷，向街道中央望去，只见一个手持手枪、身着黑西装的男子刚刚出现。他的白发与加持相同，真嗣能看到那人红色的眼睛。这是另一个天使吗？不可能，所有的天使都已被消灭。

It looked like Shinji was about to get his answer as the man called across to the three of them, "That is a very good question Agent Ikari. I fear however that you will not be finding out the answer to that question just yet."  
看来真嗣即将得到答案，那男子向他们三人喊道：“真是个好问题，碇特工。不过恐怕你暂时还无法得知答案。”

The three of them said nothing and remained hidden pressed up against the wall. Shinji looked around and observed the man putting the gun away and looking down at the floor. After a few more moments he spoke again.  
他们三人一言不发，紧贴着墙壁隐藏着。真嗣环顾四周，观察到那人收起了枪，低头看向地面。片刻之后，他又开口了。

"I want to make this simple, you step out of that place you're hiding and you hand over the virus, we then leave you and your people alone. You remain hidden there and we will come after you and take it from you by force. I will give you some time to think it over but please, for your people's sake, do not take too long over it."  
“我想让这件事简单点，你们从藏身之处走出来，交出病毒，我们就会放过你和你的人。如果你们继续躲藏，我们将强行夺取。我会给你们一些时间考虑，但请为了你们的人，不要考虑太久。”

Shinji slipped the disk into his inside jacket pocket and slowly stepped out, soon followed by Asuka and Gendo. The three of them stood facing the man who had appeared, they looked at the other three roads joining the intersection and saw more men standing facing inwards towards them. Nine in total, they were completely surrounded.  
真嗣将磁盘滑入内袋，缓缓走出，紧接着是明日香和源堂。三人面对着突然出现的男子，他们看向交汇处的其他三条道路，发现更多男子正朝他们走来。总共九人，他们完全被包围了。

The man who had spoken previously looked at them and smiled, "I'm pleased you decided to end this peacefully, we do not want to spill any more blood than is necessary."  
先前开口的那名男子看着他们，微笑道：“我很高兴你们决定和平解决此事，我们不希望再有任何不必要的流血。”

Shinji did not reply, instead he looked around him again, from Asuka and his father to the man standing in the middle of the intersection and the eight men which accompanied him. Slowly Shinji reached into his inside pocket and pulled out the disk.  
真嗣没有回答，而是再次环顾四周，从明日香和他父亲，到站在十字路口中央的那个人以及他身边的八名男子。真嗣缓缓地伸手探入内侧口袋，取出了那张磁盘。

"Good move Ikari, now move into the centre and place it down on the floor. Then turn around and go back to them."  
“明智之举，碇。现在走到中间，把它放在地上。然后转身回到他们那边去。”

Shinji complied, he walked forward not taking his eyes off of the man. He knelt down and placed the disk down and walked away. As he turned around and walked back he made brief eye contact with Asuka. She was glaring at him angrily for turning it over like that, Shinji shrugged and gave a slight smile as he walked back.  
真嗣顺从地走上前，目光始终未离开那人。他跪下放下光盘，然后走开。当他转身走回时，与明日香短暂地对视了一眼。她正因他如此轻易交出光盘而愤怒地瞪着他，真嗣耸了耸肩，微微一笑，继续走回。

"Right, now I want you three to turn around and head in the opposite direction."  
“好，现在我要你们三个转身，朝相反的方向走。”

Shinji nodded and turned around, he slowly began to walk down the street making sure to not look behind him. Asuka and Gendo followed him both equally stunned as to how he had given the disk away that easily. They moved a bit further down before Asuka quickly moved around stopping Shinji in his tracks.  
真嗣点头转身，他缓缓沿街走去，确保不回头看。明日香和源渡跟在他身后，两人都对他的轻易交出光盘感到震惊。他们又走了一段距离，明日香迅速绕到前面，拦住了真嗣的去路。

"What the hell was that Ikari? After all we've worked for, you just handed it over like that?"  
"碇，那到底是怎么回事？我们为之奋斗的一切，你就这么轻易拱手让人了？"

Shinji could sense the anger in her voice despite her quietness. He shrugged and smiled much to Asuka's disgust.  
尽管声音平静，真嗣能感觉到她语气中的愤怒。他耸了耸肩，露出微笑，这让明日香更加反感。

"I did what had to be done Asuka, they were going to kill us where we stood if we didn't. What use would we have been if we were dead?"  
"我做了必须做的事，明日香，如果我们不交出，他们就会当场杀了我们。如果我们死了，还有什么用呢？"

"You idiot we still could have done something, you could have made a run for the lab. Now they have it, now we have nothing."  
"你这个白痴，我们本来还能做些什么的，你可以跑去实验室的。现在他们拿到了，我们什么都没有了。"

"No Asuka, you're wrong."  
"不，明日香，你错了。"

He turned around and looked at the nine men, they had moved in towards the disk and were facing away from them. Shinji smiled again and continued walking down the road quickly ducking into another alleyway. This time it was his father who questioned him.  
他转过身，看着那九个人，他们已经向着圆盘移动并背对着他们。真嗣再次微笑，继续快步沿着道路走，迅速拐进另一条小巷。这次是他的父亲向他提问。

"Sohryu is correct, that was our only chance."  
"惣流说得没错，那是我们唯一的机会。"

"So what was I supposed to do? Make a run for it and risk the lives of everyone back at the camp? They were waiting for this opportunity, if we made one wrong move that would have been it, they would have sent a signal to Keel and they would have stormed the camp capturing everyone there. Keel is probably monitoring us now, that's why I did this."  
"那我该怎么办？逃跑并置营地里所有人的生命于不顾吗？他们正等着这个机会，只要我们走错一步，他们就会向基尔发出信号，然后他们会突袭营地，俘虏所有人。基尔现在很可能在监视我们，这就是我这么做的原因。"

Asuka glared at him replying, she couldn't get over what he had done. She never thought he would do something like this. Her voice was lowered but still venomous. "What if you're wrong? You just handed over our future."  
明日香瞪着他回答，她无法接受他所做的一切。她从未想过他会做出这样的事。她的声音虽低，却充满了毒意。"如果你错了怎么办？你刚刚交出了我们的未来。"

"No Asuka, I don't mean that."  
"不是的，明日香，我不是那个意思。"

He paused for a few moments before moving back out into the street and staring straight ahead, the men were still visible but had moved down the road slightly. Shinji reached into his pocket and drew out a small remote.  
他停顿了几秒钟，然后再次走到街上，直视前方，那些人依然可见，但已经稍微移动到了路的另一端。真嗣伸手从口袋里掏出一个小型遥控器。

"I mean this..." "我是说这个……"

He pressed the button on the remote and as soon as he did the area where the men were walking erupted in a ball of flame. The three of them looked on as the dust from the small explosion settled leaving on the men's dead bodies and debris scattered everywhere. Shinji quickly moved forward and turned to Asuka.  
他按下遥控器上的按钮，随即那群男子行走的区域便爆发出一团火焰。三人注视着，小规模爆炸扬起的尘埃落定后，只留下那些男子的尸体和四处散落的残骸。真嗣迅速上前，转向明日香。

"We need to get there quickly, we really don't have much time if they definitely know we're here now."  
“我们必须尽快赶到那里，如果他们确实知道我们在这儿，那我们真的没有多少时间了。”

A part of Shinji was shocked that it had worked, it has only been a last minute decision to have a fake disk made and fitted with an explosive but it had paid off. He knew Keel would have been watching them and he knew they'd want the virus from them. They moved forward back into the intersection but were stopped by another gun shot, Shinji expanded his A.T. Field and quickly turned towards the source raising his own gun and firing back. It was one of the men, he had... gotten up and regenerated somehow.  
真嗣的一部分感到震惊，这个计划竟然奏效了，这只是在最后一刻决定制作一个假磁盘并装上炸药，但结果证明这是值得的。他知道基尔会监视他们，也知道他们会想要他们手中的病毒。他们继续前进回到交叉口，却被另一声枪响拦下，真嗣展开了他的 A.T.力场，迅速转向源头，举起自己的枪还击。那名男子，他竟然……不知怎么地站了起来并再生了。

"Not a smart move Ikari, now we have to use force."  
"不是明智之举，碇，现在我们得动用武力了。"

Each of the other nine men had now gotten up and had also regenerated themselves. It was just the same as with Zeruel except now there were nine of them to content with. Without thinking Shinji charged forward at the first man tackling him directly into the wall of the nearest building. Without giving the man a chance to fight back he aimed two shots right where the man's heart would be.  
其他九名男子此时也都站了起来，并完成了自我再生。情况与零尔如出一辙，只不过现在有九个对手需要应对。毫不犹豫，真嗣冲向第一个男子，将他直接撞向最近的建筑物墙壁。不给对方反击的机会，他瞄准了男子心脏的位置连开两枪。

_'That's one.' '解决一个。'_

Shinji looked around, the remaining eight were moving back onto the intersection as Asuka and his father took cover. Shinji quickly dived over and joined them, Asuka looked at him taking out her own gun.  
真嗣环顾四周，剩下的八人正退回到交叉口，明日香和他的父亲则寻找掩护。真嗣迅速扑过去加入他们，明日香看着他，掏出了自己的枪。

"You've took down one, there's eight left. That's four each."  
“你干掉了一个，还剩八个。我们一人四个。”

Shinji nodded and looked at his father, "Right, me and Asuka will go back out. Can you provide cover for us?"  
真嗣点头看向他的父亲，“好的，我和明日香会再次出击。你能为我们提供掩护吗？”

Gendo smiled and removed his glasses, "Of course, be quick though, they will regenerate."  
源渡微笑着摘下眼镜，“当然，但要快，它们会再生的。”

With those words Shinji and Asuka leapt up from there position and began to run towards the remaining eight. They each fired in front of them making sure their A.T. Fields were expanded, Asuka leapt at her first target, her knee connecting with his face. She leapt over him firing a shot into his chest and then quickly aiming another shot at another oncoming target.  
话音刚落，真嗣和明日香从他们的位置上一跃而起，向剩下的八个使徒冲去。他们各自在前方开火，确保自己的 A.T.力场已经展开，明日香跃向她的第一个目标，膝盖狠狠地撞在他的脸上。她从他头顶跃过，朝他的胸口开了一枪，然后迅速瞄准另一个迎面而来的目标，再开一枪。

_'Two in one go, this will be easy.'  
“一次两个，这会很容易。”_

She felt someone swinging her round and was caught with a backhand from one of the other men. He connected with a well placed kick to the gut and then followed up with another hand across her face. She fell to the floor and quickly moved out of the way before he tried to drive his knee into her face. She wiped the blood she now felt trickling down her chin away and dived at the man, tackling him to the floor. Using her A.T. Field to keep him in place and she fired two shots into his chest, silencing him.  
她感觉有人将她旋转起来，随即被另一名男子反手一击。他精准地踢中她的腹部，紧接着又是一记耳光。她跌倒在地，迅速移开，以防他试图用膝盖撞击她的脸。她擦去此刻正顺着下巴流淌的鲜血，猛地扑向那人，将其摔倒在地。她利用 A.T.力场将他固定住，随即朝他胸口连开两枪，让他彻底沉默。

She looked across at Shinji to see how he was handling things, he had just taken down his fourth one. She looked around trying to find where her fourth target was and then found him, she froze up when she saw where he was. Shinji turned round too and saw it, he screamed out but it was too late. It was almost like it happened in slow motion. She looked on as Shinji dived forward towards the man before his father's body had even hit the ground.  
她转头看向真嗣，想看看他应对得如何，他已经解决了第四个。她环顾四周，试图找到她的第四个目标，终于发现了他的位置，但当她看到他在哪里时，她僵住了。真嗣也转过身来，看到了那一幕，他尖叫出声，但为时已晚。一切仿佛在慢动作中发生。她眼睁睁看着真嗣向前扑去，而他的父亲的身体还未完全触地。

Shinji was like a rabid animal, he tackled the man to the floor delivering blow after blow to the person's body. Face, stomach, anywhere was a target for him. Asuka screamed out to him to stop but it was to no avail, soon a pool of LCL had began to trickle from the man as Shinji continued pounding away at him. She ran over and dragged Shinji away from him and pinned a struggling Shinji to the ground.  
真嗣如同一只狂暴的野兽，猛地将那人扑倒在地，对着他的身体一拳接一拳地猛击。脸、肚子，任何地方都成了他的目标。明日香尖叫着让他停下，但无济于事，很快，一滩 LCL 从那人身上渗出，而真嗣依旧不停地殴打着他。她跑过去，将真嗣从那人身边拉开，并把挣扎着的真嗣按在地上。

Just a few feet away from them lay the dead body of Gendo, she gently allowed Shinji to get to his knees and looked in his tear stained eyes. He looked back at her for a moment before throwing himself at her, holding her tightly. She looked around at the scene, nine dead bodies and that of Shinji's father. So much for no bloodshed, so much for this being easy.  
就在他们几步之外，躺着源堂的尸体，她轻轻地让真嗣跪下，看着他泪痕斑斑的眼睛。他回望了她一会儿，然后扑向她，紧紧地抱住。她环顾四周，九具尸体，还有真嗣的父亲。本以为不会流血，本以为这会容易些。

She whispered in Shinji's ear as he knelt sobbing into her shoulder, "Shinji...I'm sorry it happened like this..."  
她在他耳边低语，他跪着，哭泣着靠在她的肩上，"真嗣...我很抱歉事情变成了这样..."

He withdrew his arms and looked around himself, he scrambled over towards Gendo and looked down at him. The man was gone already, no final words, no last ditch attempt to fight back. The man who had sacrificed so much to get to this point had been taken away so easily. Shinji understood his father's actions, he didn't condone them, he didn't like them but he understood. The man had been through so much and sacrificed so much. His wife had been taken from him, he had to give Shinji away so that he could not be in any danger. For each time he thought his father had abandoned him he had been there, at first it may have seemed like he was being manipulated but at the same time he was watching, ensuring nothing would happen.  
他收回双臂，环顾四周，然后匆忙爬向源渡，低头看着他。那人已经离世，没有遗言，没有最后的挣扎。那个为了达到这一步牺牲了如此之多的人，就这样轻易地被带走了。真嗣理解他父亲的行动，他不赞同，也不喜欢，但他理解。那人经历了太多，牺牲了太多。他的妻子被夺走，他不得不将真嗣送走，以免他陷入危险。每当他觉得父亲抛弃了他，实际上父亲一直在那里，起初可能看起来像是被操纵，但同时他也在观察，确保不会发生任何事。

Shinji didn't have much time to process these thoughts as Asuka put her hand on his shoulder and whispered into his ear again.  
真嗣没有太多时间去消化这些想法，因为明日香把手放在他的肩膀上，再次在他耳边低语。

"Shinji...take the key card and the disk. Make a run for the lab, we have company again."  
“真嗣……拿上钥匙卡和磁盘。快跑去实验室，我们又有麻烦了。”

Shinji looked around wondering what she meant and he saw it immediately. The nine people who had just been taken down were getting up again. Their wounds not quite healed , but still, they were up and alive. Shinji stood and prepared himself only for Asuka to call to him again.  
真嗣环顾四周，疑惑她指的是什么，随即立刻发现了。刚刚被击倒的九个人正重新站起身来。他们的伤口并未完全愈合，但依然，他们站了起来，活着。真嗣站起身，准备迎战，却被明日香再次呼唤。

"Shinji...you need to go."  
“真嗣……你得走。”

He shook his head, "No I can't leave you, you can't take on all nine of them!"  
他摇了摇头，“不，我不能离开你，你不可能对付得了他们九个！”

"I don't care, if we both die we lose...if one of us dies then we still have a chance."  
"我不在乎，如果我们都死了，我们就输了...如果只有一个人死，那我们还有机会。"

She dived at the nearest person taking him down again and silencing him for the third time. She shouted across at Shinji.  
她扑向最近的人，再次将他击倒并第三次让他闭嘴。她对着真嗣大喊。

"Go now! I'll cover you."  
"现在走！我来掩护你。"

She expanded her A.T. Field again sending another of the attackers flying backwards and stopped to reload her gun. During this time she never took her eyes off of Shinji, his destination was only a couple of metres away and he knew he should but how could he leave Asuka out here like this?  
她再次展开了 A.T.力场，将另一名攻击者击飞后退，随即停下重新装填枪支。在这期间，她的目光始终未曾离开过真嗣，他的目的地仅剩几米之遥，他知道应该离开，但怎能就这样留下明日香在这里？

"Asuka...I can't." “明日香...我做不到。”

"Shinji this isn't the time, go now!"  
“真嗣，现在不是时候，快走！”

She took out another attacker just as the others started to get up, he had to make his decision now. He took another brief glance at Asuka and then to the doorway leading to the lab. He could do this, she could handle herself until he returned. He looked back to his dead father and whispered quietly.  
就在其他攻击者开始起身之际，她又撂倒了一个。他必须现在做出决定。他再次短暂地看了看明日香，然后望向通往实验室的门口。他能做到的，她能自保直到他回来。他回头看向已故的父亲，轻声低语。

"_Thank you...father."_ “谢谢你……父亲。”

**Laboratories 实验室**

He ducked into the building and shut the door behind him, leaving Asuka to deal with the nine attackers. Something inside of him was screaming to go back out there and help her, the other part of him knew what had to be done. That the only way he could help her was to proceed down to the laboratories and insert this disk. He quickly made his way down the corridor and into a stairwell leading down to the laboratories. There it was, the door he needed to go through to end this, it all seemed so simple.  
他闪身进入建筑物，随手关上门，留下明日香独自应对那九名攻击者。内心有个声音在尖叫，催促他回去帮忙，但另一部分理智告诉他必须完成任务。他明白，唯一能帮她的方式就是继续前往实验室，插入这张磁盘。他迅速穿过走廊，进入通往实验室的楼梯间。那里，就是他需要通过的门，一切似乎都如此简单。

He withdrew the key card and placed it through the scanner, the door opened granting him access to the laboratory. After taking only a matter of steps he stopped dead in his tracks at what he saw in front of him. A huge cylindrical tank with a computer terminal hooked up to it. Around it were several smaller tanks he could not see into. It was what was inside the main tank that scared him because he knew that it was...or that it should have been impossible.  
他取出钥匙卡，通过扫描器，门应声而开，允许他进入实验室。仅仅走了几步，他便僵在原地，眼前所见让他震惊。一个巨大的圆柱形水槽，连接着电脑终端。周围还有几个较小的水槽，他无法看清内部。真正让他恐惧的是主水槽里的东西，因为他知道那本应是不可能存在的。

He stepped up to the computer terminal and inserted the disk, waiting for it to load up and trying to keep his eyes from what was floating in the LCL contained in the tank. He couldn't help it though, every moment he found himself looking at what was there. There was no mistaking it, even with the mask obscuring it's face, even with the body obscured by a tangle assortment of wires...she was there.  
他走向电脑终端，插入磁盘，等待它加载，同时努力不让自己的目光停留在水槽中 LCL 里漂浮的东西上。然而，他无法控制自己，每时每刻都不由自主地看向那里。尽管面具遮住了它的脸，尽管身体被一团乱糟糟的电线遮掩，但毫无疑问，她在那里。

Finally the program booted up and he could focus on something else other then what was floating in the tank. The program had a very basic text driven interface, it gave him two options, 'Yes' or 'No'. He typed Yes and then the program began to run, text rolled by on the screen as the machinery in the lab began to start up.  
终于，程序启动了，他可以专注于其他事情，而不是水槽里的漂浮物。程序界面非常简单，是文本驱动的，给了他两个选项，‘是’或‘否’。他输入了‘是’，然后程序开始运行，屏幕上滚动着文字，实验室里的机械设备也随之启动。

Shinji could only watch as the machinery sprang to life, there was a loud whirring noise as the LCL in the tank drained out, flooding the nearby tanks. Stumbling back he looked on as the wires surrounding Rei's body untangled themselves leaving only her naked form held in place by the mask she was wearing.  
真嗣只能眼睁睁地看着机械装置启动，随着 LCL 在罐中排空，发出巨大的嗡嗡声，附近的罐子也被淹没。他踉跄后退，只见围绕着绫波身体的电线自行解开，只剩下她赤裸的身体被面具固定住。

He looked down as more text filled the screen.  
他低头看着屏幕上不断填充的文字。

Core Injection, Soul Insertion, Memory Recovery...the text stayed fixed on screen as more whirring was heard from the tank and the machine. Shinji observed as Rei's body twitched as each process completed. Was this what he father had wanted him to find? Was Rei the weapon they were supposed to use?  
核心注入，灵魂嵌入，记忆恢复...屏幕上的文字保持不变，随着水槽和机器的更多嗡嗡声，真嗣观察到绫波的身体在每个过程完成后抽搐。这就是他父亲希望他找到的吗？绫波是他们应该使用的武器吗？

There was another pause on the screen as Shinji continued looking on as Rei was being awakened in front of his eyes. This made no sense...she was supposed to have died hundreds of miles away from here. What was she doing in this laboratory?  
屏幕上又是一阵停顿，真嗣继续注视着，看着丽在他眼前被唤醒。这毫无道理...她本应在数百英里之外死去。她在这个实验室里做什么？

Instrumentality? What was Instrumentality? Was this what was supposed to happen, was this supposed to help them? Rei waking up and then some process called Instrumentality? The mask covering Reis face lifted and the tank opened ,allowing her to step out. She looked across at Shinji either unaware or simply not concerned that she was not clothed. Shinji was barely able to speak as he addressed her. His only thoughts being what the hell was going on.  
统一心灵？什么是统一心灵？这就是应该发生的吗，这是为了帮助他们吗？丽醒来，然后是一个叫做统一心灵的过程？覆盖在丽脸上的面具升起，水槽打开，让她走出。她看着真嗣，无论是没意识到还是根本不关心自己没穿衣服。真嗣几乎说不出话来，他向她询问。他唯一的想法是这到底是怎么回事。

"Ayanami...you're...I thought you were dead...you..."  
"绫波...你...我以为你已经死了...你..."

She did not respond instead she simply looked at him and then with one swift movement she expanded her A.T. Field knocking him off of his feet and sending him flying back. He quickly scrambled to his feet and went after her. She spun around and stopped him, sending him flying back again.  
她没有回应，只是静静地看着他，随即迅速展开她的 A.T.力场，将他击倒并弹飞出去。他迅速爬起身，追了上去。她转身拦住他，再次将他击飞。

This time it was accompanied by a brilliant flash of light, Shinji got back up and looked at where she had stood. Ayanami had vanished, she had attacked him and then vanished in that flash of light. Just as he thought more about it he remembered Asuka up top. He had left her to deal with nine attackers and she hadn't followed him in yet.  
这一次伴随着耀眼的光芒，真嗣重新站起，看向她刚才站立的地方。绫波已经消失，她在那光芒中攻击了他，然后消失了。正当他还在思索时，他想起了顶楼的明日香。他把她留下来对付九个敌人，而她还没有跟上来。

Shinji sprinted back out of the building back to where he and Asuka had been attacked only to find the area completely deserted. He looked around but there was nothing there, none of the attackers, no Asuka...not even his father's body. Had they all vanished just like Ayanami had a minute ago?  
真嗣飞奔回建筑物外，回到他和明日香被袭击的地方，却发现那里空无一人。他环顾四周，却什么也没发现，没有攻击者，没有明日香...甚至连他父亲的尸体也不见了。难道他们就像刚才绫波一样，在一分钟前全部消失了？

"What took you so long?"  
“你怎么这么慢？”

He span around at the sound of the voice and saw Asuka emerging from a nearby alleyway. She looked badly injured, her face was cut and her shirt was torn. Shinji could see a mixture of blood and LCL dripping from wounds on her Arms and near her eye. He ran over embracing her, not caring that she screamed out in pain when he wrapped his arms around her. She shoved him off and nursed her injuries muttering to herself.  
他听到声音猛地转身，看到明日香从附近的巷子里走出来。她看起来伤得很重，脸上划伤，衬衫也被撕破了。真嗣可以看到她的手臂和眼周的伤口滴着血和 LCL 混合物。他跑过去抱住她，不在乎她因他的拥抱而痛苦地尖叫。她推开他，一边护理伤口一边喃喃自语。

"Well if they didn't hurt before they do now...what happened down there Shinji? They were attacking relentlessly, I kept on taking them down but they kept on getting back up and then...I don't know if it was the blood loss or what but...Ayanami appeared and expanded some sort of A.T. Field and then...they were gone in a flash of light."  
“好吧，如果他们之前没受伤，那现在肯定受了...下面发生了什么，真嗣？他们无休止地攻击，我不断击倒他们，但他们不断站起来，然后...我不知道是因为失血还是什么，但...绫波出现了，展开了某种 A.T.力场，然后...他们在一道闪光中消失了。”

Shinji nodded wiping his eyes, "I know...she attacked me, that was what was inside the lab Asuka...Ayanami was there in some sort of tank..."  
真嗣点头擦了擦眼睛，“我知道...她攻击了我，那就是实验室里的东西，明日香...绫波在一个类似水槽的东西里...”

"Are you sure?" "你确定吗？"

He looked at her, "Yes...of course I am, we need to get back Asuka. Whatever happened it can't be good."  
他看着她，“是的...当然，我们需要回去，明日香。无论发生了什么，都不会是好事。”

He took a few steps forward before Asuka called after him, "Shinji...I'm sorry about what happened to your father..."  
他向前走了几步，随后明日香在他身后喊道，“真嗣……关于你父亲的事，我很抱歉……”

He paused and responded his voice emotionless, "I know."  
他停下脚步，声音毫无感情地回应，“我知道。”

_10__h_ _December 2015_ 2015 年 12 月 10 日

**Command Centre 指挥中心**

It was well past midnight when they finally arrived back at the camp. Asuka threw the bag she was carrying down on the floor and paused at the entrance. They had to ditch the car they were driving some time ago much to her annoyance. The rest of the journey back they had walked mostly in silence only really speaking to say when one needed to rest or to utter something else.  
当他们终于回到营地时，已是深夜。明日香将手中的包扔在地上，站在入口处停顿了一下。他们不得不在不久前丢弃了驾驶的汽车，这让她颇为恼火。剩下的路程他们大多沉默地走着，只是偶尔说话，要么是有人需要休息，要么是说些其他的事情。

She didn't mind it being that way though, all she wanted to do was get back, confirm that they had completed their mission and then rest. She knew though that that would be impossible, they hadn't completed the mission. Shinji's father had been killed in the process, Ayanami had somehow been restored to life and for all she knew there were still nine people with advanced Evangelion serum flowing through them out there.  
尽管如此，她并不介意这种状态，她只想回来确认任务完成，然后休息。但她知道这是不可能的，任务并未完成。真嗣的父亲在过程中被杀，绫波零不知怎么复活了，而据她所知，仍有九个人体内流淌着先进的 EVA 血清。

"Asuka, I..." "明日香，我..."

She turned around just in time to catch Shinji before he fell to the ground. She quickly hooked her arms under his shoulders and gently guided him to the floor laying him down. Exhaustion she told herself, he was just exhausted. Blood loss, a couple of miles walk and narrowly escaping nine genetically enhanced freaks...anyone would go down from all that.  
她及时转身，在真嗣倒地前扶住了他。她迅速将双臂伸到他的肩膀下，轻轻地引导他躺到地板上。她告诉自己，他只是筋疲力尽。失血过多，走了好几英里路，还险些被九个基因改造的怪物抓住...任何人都会因此倒下的。

If that was the case then why did she find herself trembling with fear that he might not wake up? Why was she on the verge of breaking down, fearing that he was gone? She took a few deep breaths and wiped the tears from her eyes, telling herself that he would wake up. That he had just collapsed from all the strain but something inside her wasn't letting her think that way. She turned and placed her hands on his shoulders and began shaking him.  
如果真是那样，那她为何会因害怕他可能醒不过来而颤抖？为何她几乎要崩溃，担心他已经离去？她深呼吸几次，擦去眼角的泪水，告诉自己他会醒来的。他只是因为过度劳累而倒下，但内心深处有什么东西不让她这样想。她转身，双手放在他的肩膀上，开始摇晃他。

"Don't do this...wake up damn it."  
“别这样...醒醒，该死的。”

She shook him more violently as she felt tears streaming down her face. Every part of her just wanting him to wake back up. She didn't care if he was exhausted, she needed him there with her.  
她更加剧烈地摇晃着他，泪水顺着脸颊流淌。她身体的每一部分都只希望他能再次醒来。她不在乎他是否疲惫，她需要他在她身边。

"Don't leave me like this, please...don't leave me..."  
“请不要这样离开我，求你了...不要离开我...”

She stopped shaking him as she saw his eyes open slowly, he looked directly into her own eyes and smiled.  
她停止了摇晃，看到他的眼睛缓缓睁开，他直视着她的眼睛，微笑了。

"Sorry." "对不起。"

She laid down next him and laid her head on his chest, "Idiot..."  
她在他身边躺下，头靠在他的胸膛上，“傻瓜……”

"I know." "我知道。"

"I wish this could be over, that we could just have...semi normal lives again."  
“我希望这一切能结束，我们能重新过上……半正常的生活。”

She thought about what she had said, what would she be doing if this wasn't happening? Would she be working with Shinji? Would they have even met?  
她思考着自己刚才的话，如果这一切没有发生，她会在做什么？会和真嗣一起工作吗？他们甚至会相遇吗？

Shinji was thinking about it too, "If this didn't happen we wouldn't have met though, I suppose that's one good thing to come out of it."  
真嗣也在思考这个问题，“如果这一切没有发生，我们也许就不会相遇，但我想这至少是一件好事。”

"Maybe but it isn't exactly convenient, either of us could die any time from now. We're pretty much the only free thinking humans left on Earth aside from those inside the camp."  
“或许吧，但这并不方便，从现在开始我们随时都可能死去。除了那些在营地内的人，我们几乎是地球上仅存的自由思考的人类了。”

She paused for a moment, thinking about it a bit more, "You know even if we had have met and still been assigned to each other what would we be doing? We'd probably be stuck investigating some random paranormal occurrence in a Tokyo 3 suburb. I'd think you were an idiot with your theories and you'd think I was the closed minded sceptic who isn't willing to listen. We'd solve the case and then both go home to our pathetic lives..."  
她停顿了一下，更深入地思考着，“你知道吗，即使我们相遇了并且被分配在一起，我们会做什么呢？我们可能会被困在东京 3 的一个郊区调查某个随机的超自然现象。我会认为你的理论很愚蠢，而你会觉得我是个不愿倾听的封闭思想者。我们解决了案件，然后各自回到自己可悲的生活中……”

Shinji chuckled, "Yeah that sounds about right..."  
真嗣轻声笑道，“是啊，听起来挺对的……”

Immediately the chuckling stopped as the events of the day came back to him. "I just wish..."  
笑声立刻停止了，因为当天发生的事情又浮现在他脑海中。“我只是希望……”

He paused finding it difficult to get the words out, "I wish I could have gotten to know my father a bit more, I always thought I hated him because I didn't know why he abandoned me and why he placed all this on me."  
他停顿了一下，觉得难以启齿，“我希望我能多了解我父亲一些，我一直以为我恨他，因为我不知道他为什么抛弃我，为什么把这一切都压在我身上。”

She didn't respond yet, waiting to see if he would say anything else. When she wanted to respond she found that she couldn't. What could she say to him? He had only just that day saw his father shot dead in the middle of the street.  
她尚未回应，等待看他是否还会说些什么。当她想要回应时，却发现无法开口。她能对他说什么呢？他才在那天亲眼目睹父亲在街头被枪杀。

"He died for the cause he worked hard for Shinji. He was dedicated to it, I know its cold but he died so that you could get into that lab and insert that software."  
“他为了他所奋斗的事业而死，真嗣。他全心投入，我知道这很残酷，但他牺牲自己，是为了让你能进入那个实验室并植入那段软件。”

"I suppose but...what did we achieve with that...Ayanami appearing to us and then vanishing. It doesn't feel like we have achieved anything."  
“我想是吧，但是……我们通过那件事得到了什么……绫波的出现然后又消失。感觉我们什么都没达成。”

"I know what you mean, I was at least expecting someone to greet us when we got back. What a disappointment that was."  
"我明白你的意思，至少我以为我们回来时会有人迎接。没想到这么令人失望。"

For the first time the two of them sat up and looked into the camp. Every light in the camp except for those illuminating the entrance was off and there was complete silence. It was strange how none of them had even noticed it before. They had been so preoccupied they had never bothered to look inside. Shinji quickly got to his feet and took out his flashlight.  
这是他们第一次坐起来，仔细观察营地。除了入口处的灯光，营地里所有的灯都熄灭了，四周一片寂静。奇怪的是，他们之前竟然都没有注意到这一点。他们一直心事重重，从未费心往里看。真嗣迅速站起身，拿出手电筒。

"Asuka, you check the western quarters I'll look at the eastern ones. Something isn't right here."  
"明日香，你去检查西侧区域，我看看东边。这里有些不对劲。"

She nodded and also took out her flash light and headed off in the opposite direction to him. Shinji quickly made his way over to the quarters and peered inside aiming his flash light at the various bunks there. Just as he suspected everyone inside was gone, their belongings left scattered but the people themselves vanished.  
她点头同意，也拿出手电筒，朝与他相反的方向走去。真嗣迅速走向宿舍，探头向内，用手电筒照向各个床铺。正如他所料，里面空无一人，物品散落一地，但人却消失无踪。

He turned away and went back over towards the camp where Asuka was stood waiting for him, he called across to her. "They've all gone, no one has left it's like they were there then just...vanished."  
他转身回到营地，看到明日香站在那里等他，便向她喊道：“他们都走了，没有任何人离开的迹象，就像他们原本在那里，然后突然……消失了。”

"You don't think Keel could have-"  
“你不会认为基尔可能……”

He cut her off, "No I don't, if Keel had been here I think we'd know about it. He'd use some of them as a bargaining chip or leave some sort of message. There's no sign of forced entry or anything though..."  
他打断了她，“不，我不这么认为，如果基尔在这里，我们应该会有所察觉。他会用其中一些人作为谈判筹码，或者留下某种信息。但这里没有任何强行闯入的迹象……”

"I noticed that, it looks like they just...disappeared."  
“我注意到了，看起来他们就像是……凭空消失了。”

Shinji got ready to respond but was promptly interrupted by a terrifying roar screaming across the sky accompanied by a white flash. He turned towards the source of the flash and saw it was coming from the direction of where SEELE's bunker was. It was a huge cross shaped explosion, he saw several more flaring up next to it before everything turned white around him. He felt his body being forced upwards but he didn't try to resist. Instead he allowed himself to be taken to wherever this force wanted him to be.  
真嗣正准备回应，却被一声划破天际的恐怖咆哮打断，紧接着是一道白光闪现。他转向闪光的来源，发现是从 SEELE 的地下掩体方向传来的。那是一场巨大的十字形爆炸，他看到旁边又接连爆发了几处，随后周围的一切都变得白茫茫一片。他感到自己的身体被一股力量向上推，但他没有反抗，任由这股力量将他带向未知的目的地。

_-------------_

When Shinji opened his eyes again he found himself in a white room or, to be precise not so much a room, but a white space, stretching on into eternity. He took a few steps and his footsteps echoed loudly into the distance. What had just happened to him? This was so different to when he had been taken before. The force pulling him, the cross shaped explosion and this white space, was this what was supposed to happen when he loaded up that program?  
当真嗣再次睁开眼睛时，他发现自己身处一个白色的房间，或者更准确地说，是一片无边无际的白色空间。他走了几步，脚步声在远方回响。刚刚发生了什么？这与之前他被带走时的情景截然不同。那股牵引他的力量，十字形的爆炸，还有这片白色空间，难道这就是他启动那个程序时应该发生的事情吗？

"_That is correct, Ikari."_  
“没错，碇。”

Shinji spun around at the sound of the voice and then saw her, she was only a matter of metres away from him and was wearing the same black catsuit he had seen her in when they first met. The strange thing about her was that she was floating, only a matter of inches from the ground but she was.  
听到声音，真嗣猛地转身，随即看到了她，她距离他仅几米之遥，穿着初次见面时的那件黑色紧身衣。奇怪的是，她悬浮着，离地面仅几英寸，但确实如此。

Shinji questioned her, "What is this place? Did I die?"  
真嗣向她问道：“这是什么地方？我死了吗？”

Ayanami shook her head and moved towards him.  
绫波摇了摇头，向他走去。

"You did not die Ikari...this is the Instrumentality that you started when you awakened me. This is what your father wanted you to achieve. The process in which every human soul is taken from the body and connected."  
“你没有死，碇……这是你唤醒我时启动的人类补完计划。这是你父亲希望你达成的目标。这个过程是将每个人的灵魂从肉体中抽离并连接起来。”

This didn't make any sense, she had just said that the soul had left the body but...he could still see his body. He could still move and use his body, it was still there and it was still a part of him. Besides which even if that was the case how could the soul survive without the body?  
这毫无道理，她刚刚才说灵魂已经离开了身体，但是...他仍然能看到自己的身体。他还能移动和使用自己的身体，它依然存在，依旧是他的组成部分。再者，即便情况如此，灵魂又如何在无身体的情况下存活呢？

"Your body has been harvested and inserted into the collective, as has Sohryu's and every other living human. It is still alive and functioning, your soul has simply ascended for this moment in time."  
“你的身体已被采集并融入集体之中，同样的情况也发生在苏龙和所有其他活着的人类身上。它依然活着并正常运作，你的灵魂只是暂时升华了。”

He turned to her and shouted back angrily, "That wasn't meant to happen, we were supposed to avoid this. We were supposed to be freeing humanity! You mean my fathers plan was for this to happen anyway?"  
他转向她，愤怒地喊道：“这不该发生的，我们本应避免这种情况。我们本应是解放人类！你的意思是，我父亲的计划无论如何都会导致这一切发生？”

"That is correct." "是的，没错。"

Shinji dashed forward and grabbed hold of Rei's shoulders shaking her violently, "He lied to me then, there was no virus was there?"  
真嗣猛地冲上前，紧紧抓住绫波的肩膀剧烈摇晃，“他当时骗了我，根本没有什么病毒，对吧？”

"Your father's scenario was carried out as planned, he did not lie to you."  
“你父亲的计划按部就班地执行了，他没有对你撒谎。”

Shinji shouted, "If he didn't lie then why am I here now? Why aren't I back at the camp? Why is every other human going through this process?"  
真嗣喊道，“如果他没有撒谎，那我现在为什么会在这里？为什么我没有回到营地？为什么其他所有人都要经历这个过程？”

"Because that was a requirement Ikari, you and Sohryu are the only two humans going through this process."  
“因为那是碇的要求，真嗣，你和绫波是仅有的两位经历这一过程的人类。”

Shinji calmed himself down and released Rei from his grip shaking his head, "So is there some way to return, is there a way to go back?"  
真嗣平复了心情，松开了对绫波的束缚，摇着头问道：“那么，有没有办法回去，有没有办法回到原来的地方？”

Rei did not answer his question directly instead she told him more about this strange process. "I cannot answer that, it is not for me to say. This process was designed to provide an idyllic environment for the souls of those harvested."  
绫波没有直接回答他的问题，而是向他进一步解释了这个奇异的过程。“我无法回答那个问题，这不是我能决定的。这个过程旨在为被收割的灵魂提供一个理想的环境。”

She paused before continuing, "While the bodies themselves are used as slaves the minds and souls are taken through this process where each one enters their own perfect world. All my race seeks is perfection for all species across the galaxy. While you may not agree with their methods, you cannot disagree with their goals."  
她停顿了一下，接着说：“尽管这些身体本身被用作奴隶，但通过这个过程，心灵和灵魂会被带入他们各自的完美世界。我的种族所追求的，是为银河系中所有物种带来完美。尽管你可能不认同他们的方法，但你不能否认他们的目标。”

Shinji was about to argue back when he noticed one thing in Rei's short speech, she had referred to them as 'my race'.  
真嗣正要反驳，却注意到丽简短发言中的一个细节，她称他们为‘我的种族’。

"Your race?" “你的种族？”

"Allow me to correct myself, the being you see in front of you is the being you know as Rei Ayanami. Rei Ayanami was created shortly before what you came to know as the Impact, she was created as a vessel to hold the soul of the second angel. The Angel known as Lilith, I stand before you now as both Lilith and Rei Ayanami, we are both one and the same entity."  
"请允许我纠正自己，你眼前所见的这个存在，就是你熟知的绫波零。绫波零在你们所知的大冲击发生前不久被创造出来，她被创造为容纳第二使徒灵魂的容器。这位使徒名为莉莉丝，我现在以莉莉丝和绫波零的双重身份站在你面前，我们既是同一个实体，也是一体两面。"

"Why? If you have the force and power you do have then why didn't you just take us by force? Why all the lies and secrets, why not a full on attack?"  
"为什么？如果你拥有你所展现的力量，为何不直接用武力夺取我们？为何要编织谎言和秘密，而不是直接发动全面攻击？"

"That was not a choice of mine, my race was split into two factions, each with similar goals. We came to your planet thousands of years ago. There was a war which lead to both myself and the representative of the other faction, the being known as Adam, being placed in stasis until we were discovered by SEELE. Adam struck a deal with SEELE to split power and colonize this planet by force."  
"那并非我的选择，我的种族分裂成两个派系，各自有着相似的目标。我们数千年前来到你们的星球。一场战争导致我和另一派系的代表，即被称为亚当的存在，被置于休眠状态，直到被 SEELE 发现。亚当与 SEELE 达成协议，分割权力并通过武力殖民这颗星球。"

She paused for a moment, "My side do not desire the same, we offer races a choice between ascending and not. If people desire they may return at any time. I was found by your father and was placed into this vessel. I lived as Rei Ayanami for a short time coming to terms with who I was and finding out about humanity. It was not an easy process as you can imagine, at many times I was unable to recall my identity as Lilith and often found myself longing for something more as a human."  
她顿了顿，“我这一方并不追求相同的目标，我们给予种族选择的权利，是升华还是止步。如果人们愿意，他们随时可以回归。我是被你父亲发现并安置在这个容器中的。我作为绫波零生活了一段时间，逐渐接受了自己的身份，并了解了人类。如你所想，这个过程并不轻松，很多时候我无法回忆起自己作为莉莉丝的身份，常常发现自己渴望作为人类能拥有更多。”

"But Rei...you..." “但绫波...你...”

"Died?" “死了？”

She paused, "Yes I did, however the soul of what you know as an angel is transferable, I was simply transported into this body and awaited being awakened by your father. It was a pleasant surprise to see that it was you who had activated the clone."  
她顿了顿，“是的，我确实如此，不过你所知的所谓天使的灵魂是可以转移的，我只是被传送到了这个身体里，等待你父亲唤醒我。没想到是你激活了克隆体，这真是个愉快的惊喜。”

"You attacked me though and then you disappeared."  
“但你攻击了我，然后就消失了。”

"I know and for that I apologize, I was disorientated and I needed to..."  
“我知道，为此我道歉，我当时迷失了方向，我需要……”

"You needed to harvest those remaining on Earth?"  
"你需要收割地球上剩下的那些吗？"

She nodded and smiled, "That is correct."  
她点点头，微笑道："正是如此。"

Shinji walked forward but was blocked by her A.T. Field, almost immediately the scene around him began to shift. It was no longer the white space but instead what he recognised to be a small suburb in Tokyo 3. He tried to turn around but found he was no longer in his body but was instead just an observer.  
真嗣向前走去，却被她的 A.T.力场挡住，几乎立刻，周围的景象开始变化。不再是那片空白空间，而是他认出是第三新东京市的一个小郊区。他试图转身，却发现自己的身体不见了，变成了一个旁观者。

"What is this?" “这是什么？”

"_This is what your heart desires Shinji Ikari, this is your perfect existence."_  
"这就是你的心之所愿，碇真嗣，这是你完美的存在。"

He watched on as he saw a group of people on the front lawn of a house, three women and an equal number of men. He recognised two of them immediately but the third one he couldn't quite figure out who she was just yet. He heard Ayanami's voice again as he tried to remember.  
他看着一群人在一所房子的前院，三名女性和同样数量的男性。他立刻认出了其中两个，但第三个他一时想不起来是谁。他试图回忆时，又听到了绫波的声音。

"_Strange that you do not recognise the third one, she is the person for which Ayanami's body is based off of. She is the one who guided you into trusting your father."_  
"奇怪的是你认不出第三个人，她的形象是基于绫波的身体塑造的。她是引导你信任你父亲的那个人。"

"My mother...why is she alive?"  
"我妈妈...她为什么还活着？"

"_This is what your heart created, a perfect world where your mother never died, your world where you cannot be hurt...where you do not feel that pain you do every day...where you were never abandoned and never had the fate of the world placed on you."_  
"这是你的心所创造的，一个完美的世界，在那里你母亲从未离世，你的世界里你不会受到伤害...你不会感受到每天都在承受的痛苦...在那里你从未被遗弃，也从未背负起世界的命运。"

Shinji watched a bit more as the other version of himself stood with his arms around Asuka. It looked peaceful, Misato was there alongside Kaji, his father was there along with his mother. It was as had been described his ideal world, a world where he could not be hurt but why was she showing him this? Did she want him to just accept this? It was tempting but at the same time it wasn't real.  
真嗣又看了片刻，另一个自己正拥抱着明日香。画面看起来很平静，美里和加持也在一旁，父亲和母亲也在。正如所描述的那样，这是他的理想世界，一个他不会受到伤害的世界，但她为什么要给他看这个？她希望他就此接受这一切吗？这很诱人，但同时这也不是真实的。

"This is wrong..." "这不对..."

"_You do not like this?"_  
"你不喜欢这个吗？"

He watched a few moments longer, trying to decide if he really thought it was wrong. He was tempted, and it most certainly seemed real. He could feel the breeze against him, he could smell the air and the faint smell of barbecued food drifted over to him. The voices and the laughter from the people gathered, from the family...his family, rang in his ears.  
他又观察了一会儿，试图确定自己是否真的认为这是错的。他感到诱惑，这一切显然如此真实。他能感受到微风拂面，能嗅到空气中的气息，还有远处飘来的烧烤食物的香味。人们的笑声和欢聚一堂的声音，来自那个家庭...他的家庭，在他耳边回响。

"I...don't know what to think."  
"我...不知道该怎么想。"

"_It is what is inside your heart which created this world Ikari.. your dreams and desires helped to shape this. Everything you wanted is here, family, friends, a proper life..."_  
"碇，是你的内心创造了这个世界。你的梦想和愿望塑造了这一切。你想要的一切都在这里，家人、朋友、一个正常的生活..."

A car pulled up to the front of the house, Shinji felt tears well up in his eyes when he saw the person who stepped out.  
一辆车停在了房子前，当真嗣看到下车的人时，他的眼泪涌了出来。

"Touji..." "冬二..."

"_Yes...in this world there was no Evangelion project...NERV still exists and you still work for NERV but there was no colonization project, no SEELE, which means Touji never died."_  
"是的...在这个世界里没有 EVA 计划...NERV 依然存在，你仍在为 NERV 工作，但没有殖民计划，没有 SEELE，这意味着冬二从未死去。"

It was becoming more real for him, the idea of leaving it all behind and accepting this. Shinji thought about his life so far, lies...manipulation...abandonment...loss...he had never had nor was likely to have a good or a happy life. The people who he cared for were dead or likely to die, if he went back then what would happen? They'd just spend time running away, here...well it wasn't real but...it was as good as.  
这个想法对他来说越来越真实，放弃一切并接受这个现实。真嗣回顾了自己迄今为止的生活，谎言...操纵...抛弃...失去...他从未拥有过，也不太可能拥有一个美好或快乐的生活。他所关心的人要么已经死去，要么可能死去，如果他回去会发生什么？他们只会不断逃避，在这里...虽然不是真实的，但...也差不多。

He was about to take a few more steps across when he caught this worlds version of Asuka looking over at where he was. She was staring through him, Shinji knew she couldn't see him but for a moment he could have sworn he saw her expression change. Disgust...was that it? He thought about Asuka, the real Asuka...not this fantasy Asuka. What would Asuka tell him right now? If she knew he was considering this? Considering accepting a false reality? She'd hate him for it, and in the end he'd only end up hating himself even more.  
他正要再跨几步过去，却瞥见这个世界的明日香正朝他所在的方向望来。她的目光穿透了他，真嗣知道她看不见他，但有那么一瞬，他几乎发誓看到她的表情变了。是厌恶吗……？他想着明日香，真正的明日香……不是这个幻想中的明日香。如果她知道他正在考虑这件事，会告诉他什么？考虑接受一个虚假的现实？她会因此恨他，而最终，他只会更加痛恨自己。

"_You are still having doubts?"_  
“你还在犹豫吗？”

"I like it but...it isn't real, even though I desire this, even though I want it...it isn't real. It's just a facsimile, it's fake. I'd just be running away if I accepted this and I've done too much of that. The Asuka there...she might accept me but the real Asuka she would never accept me if I did something like that."  
“我喜欢这里，但是……它并不真实，尽管我渴望这一切，尽管我想要它……它只是个复制品，是假的。如果我接受了这一切，那只是在逃避，我已经逃避得太多了。那里的明日香……她或许会接受我，但真正的明日香，如果我做出那样的事，她绝不会接受我。”

"_You would rather live where you can be hurt than where you cannot?"_  
"你宁愿生活在可能受伤的地方，也不愿去一个无法受伤的地方？"

"I guess that's correct...because at least then I know what's real and what isn't. Knowing that it wasn't real would just cause me more pain because no one there would be the real people."  
"我想那是正确的……因为在那里，至少我知道什么是真实的，什么不是。知道那不是真实的只会让我更痛苦，因为没有一个人是真正的人。"

The scene shifted again and Shinji found himself back in the white space he had been in earlier, Ayanami was stood in front of him again.  
场景再次转换，真嗣发现自己回到了之前所在的白色空间，绫波零再次站在他面前。

"It was just as your father said. You would be strong enough to reject it."  
"正如你父亲所说。你足够坚强，能够拒绝它。"

Shinji looked around, confused as to her meaning.  
真嗣环顾四周，对她的话感到困惑。

"There was no virus Shinji, the virus was me. I am the one with the power to end this, I can send you back to where you want to be. I can end this process of instrumentality for everyone if you desire it."  
"没有病毒，真嗣，病毒就是我。我有结束这一切的力量，我可以把你送回你想去的地方。如果你愿意，我可以终止所有人的神格化进程。"

"I do." "我愿意。"

She smiled, "You must understand though that not everyone will feel the same way you do. The majority will wish to remain in their perfect worlds. These people will over time become your enemies as my enemies use them to fight against you. You must be prepared to make choices you may not like."  
她微笑着说：“你必须明白，并非所有人都与你感受相同。大多数人会选择留在他们完美的世界里。随着时间推移，这些人会成为你的敌人，我的敌人会利用他们来对抗你。你必须准备好做出可能不喜欢的选择。”

"I understand." "我明白了。"

"People will only return to you if they desire it, and even then the rebuilding process will be slow. I will have my people assist you as there will be a backlash. Thanks to the serum that was developed this process will happen across my enemies' ships as well. You must be sure you want this."  
“人们只有在渴望回归时才会回到你身边，即便如此，重建过程也将是缓慢的。我会让我的人协助你，因为会有反弹。多亏了研发的血清，这个过程也会在我敌人的船上发生。你必须确定你真的想要这样。”

He nodded understanding her completely, there was no turning back now.  
他点头表示完全理解她的话，现在已无回头之路。

"I do want this." "我确实想要这个。"

As soon as he finished speaking the scene shifted again, cross shaped light flared up around him as he felt his body being forced away again. Pain shot through each part of his body as if he was being torn apart and slowly stitched back together.  
他话音刚落，场景再次转换，十字形的光芒在他周围爆发，他感到自己的身体再次被强行拉扯离开。剧痛如潮水般涌遍全身，仿佛被撕裂后又缓慢地缝合起来。

_'What...what is this?' '这...这是什么？'_

The pain was too much, he felt his body lifted but he wasn't able to find out where too. Closing his eyes he allowed himself to pass out.  
疼痛太过剧烈，他感觉自己的身体被抬起，却无法确定去向何方。闭上眼睛，他任由自己昏迷过去。

_-------------_

Asuka blinked and found herself looking into an eternal white space. A room what appeared to be completely white and stretched on forever. She reached into her jacket for her hand gun but found her pockets completely empty. She turned around at the sound of a familiar voice.  
明日香眨了眨眼，发现自己正凝视着一片永恒的白色空间。一个看似完全白色、无边无际的房间。她伸手去夹克里找手枪，却发现口袋空空如也。听到一个熟悉的声音，她转过身去。

"_Sohryu I do not wish to hurt you, I wish to speak with you."_  
“惣流，我不想伤害你，我只想和你谈谈。”

The voice sent a chill down Asuka's spine because it belonged to a person that Asuka had up until now thought was dead. Even with the sighting earlier it still scared her, the fact that she could hear Ayanami and could now see her. Asuka stumbled backwards with fear.  
那声音让明日香脊背发凉，因为它属于一个她至今仍以为已故的人。尽管之前有过目击，但听到绫波的声音并能看见她，依然让她感到恐惧。明日香因恐惧而踉跄后退。

"Ayanami you…you're...how?"  
“绫波，你……你……怎么……？”

"There is much I need to explain to you Sohryu, this is the process of Instrumentality which yourself and Ikari started. The process in which every human soul has ascended from their bodies and connected in one collective entity. Each soul living peacefully in their desired world, yourself and Ikari have been disconnected from this process. Shinji because he is the one who began the process...yourself however...your heart rejected it from the beginning."  
“我有太多需要向你解释的了，惣流。这是人类补完计划的过程，你和碇君启动了这个过程。在这个过程中，每个人的灵魂都从肉体中升华，连接成一个集体实体。每个灵魂都在他们理想的世界中和平地生活，你和碇君则被从这个过程中分离出来。真嗣因为他开始了这个过程……而你……你的心从一开始就拒绝了这个过程。”

"My...my heart rejected it?" Asuka stammered out.  
"我...我的心拒绝了它？" 明日香结巴地说道。

"That is correct, your only desire is to go back and not to live within a perfect world. You desire immediately to go back to a world where there is pain and suffering."  
"没错，你唯一的愿望是回去，而不是生活在一个完美的世界里。你渴望立刻回到一个充满痛苦和苦难的世界。"

She thought about what she had just been told, it was true. Given the choice she would reject it immediately, she wouldn't run away like that. The thought of it made her sick even though she knew she had in the past tried to convince herself that her problems did not exist.  
她思考着刚刚被告知的事情，这是真的。如果有选择，她会立即拒绝，她不会那样逃避。一想到这，她就感到恶心，尽管她知道过去曾试图说服自己问题不存在。

"If my desire is to go back then why am I here?"  
"如果我的愿望是回去，那我为何会在这里？"

"Because you are only one half, both you and Shinji must agree to allow humanity to return for you to successfully return."  
"因为你只是半身，你和真嗣都必须同意让人类回归，你才能成功返回。"

"So why are you here Ayanami?"  
"那么，绫波，你为何在此？"

"I am here because I am the centre, I am the gateway through with all souls pass. What you see in front of you is the human vessel designated Rei Ayanami but this vessel contains the soul of the second Angel, Lillith."  
"我在此，因我是中心，我是所有灵魂必经的门户。你眼前所见之人形名为绫波零，但此躯壳内寄宿着第二使徒莉莉丝的灵魂。"

"You...you're an Angel?" "你...你是使徒？"

"That is correct, my designation by your standards would be the second but I was born at the same time as the one known as Adam. I am the leader of another faction working against the ones you have seen. We arrived on this planet thousands of years ago but a war forced both me and Adam into stasis until we were discovered by SEELE."  
"正是如此，依你们的分类，我被称作第二使徒，但我与被称为亚当的存在同时诞生。我是另一派系的领袖，与你们所见的那一方为敌。数千年前我们降临此星球，但一场战争迫使我和亚当进入休眠，直至被 SEELE 发现。"

She stopped speaking for a moment as the scene shifted to an unfamiliar setting. From what she could see it appeared to be a tomb of sorts, from the markings and ornaments she would guess Egyptian but there were many other markings there unfamiliar to her.  
她停顿了一下，随着场景转换到了一个陌生的地方。从她所见来看，这似乎是一种墓穴，从标记和装饰来看，她猜测是埃及的，但那里还有许多她不熟悉的其他标记。

"What is this place?" “这是什么地方？”

"This is where they held me for thousands of years until I was discovered by Gendo Ikari and awoken. This is a recreation of the tomb from my own memories."  
“这就是他们囚禁我数千年的地方，直到被碇源堂发现并唤醒。这是我根据自己记忆重建的墓穴。”

"Egyptian?" “埃及的？”

"No, but many of the things here did find their way into the Egyptian empire. No, this is a place that sank before the Egyptian empire. A place spoke of only in your legends..."  
"不，但这里的许多东西确实流传到了埃及帝国。不，这是一个在埃及帝国之前沉没的地方。一个只在你传说中提到的地方……"

Asuka turned and looked at her sceptically, "You can't be serious?"  
明日香转过身，怀疑地看着她，"你不是认真的吧？"

"I do not understand why you have trouble believing this, considering all that you have seen."  
"考虑到你所见过的种种，我不明白你为何难以相信这一点。"

Asuka laughed, "I guess the idea of a sunken continent is still a bit hard for me to believe especially considering that you're telling me that your people have been here since before that time."  
明日香笑了，“沉没大陆的概念对我来说还是有点难以置信，尤其是你告诉我你们的人民早在那时之前就居住在这里。”

"Understandable but my origin is not important, I needed to show you this so that you could see that I am on your side."  
“可以理解，但我的起源并不重要，我需要向你展示这一点，以便你能明白我是站在你这边的。”

"If you were on our side you would have prevented this and not brought us here. Instead you..."  
“如果你站在我们这边，你就应该阻止这一切，而不是带我们来这里。相反，你……”

"Took the rest of the survivors and did the same to them as our enemies did? I know Sohryu, but we had no choice, for this to occur every human had to undergo this process. It was the only way, I promise you will return. Shinji is currently making the decision. I regret I have to offer him the choice but I am sure he will make the right decision."  
"将其他幸存者也如我们对敌人所做的那样对待？我了解 Sohryu，但我们别无选择，为了让这一切发生，每个凡人都必须经历这个过程。这是唯一的办法，我向你保证你会回来的。Shinji 正在做出决定。我很遗憾必须让他面对这个选择，但我确信他会做出正确的决定。"

She paused again but before Asuka could speak she started speaking again, "There is one thing I would like to mention to you. One thing that has not been cleared up, the subject of Katsuragi and her child."  
她再次停顿，但在 Asuka 能开口之前，她又开始说话了，"有件事我想向你提一下。有一件事还没有澄清，那就是 Katsuragi 和她孩子的问题。"

"Why did Keel want her child?"  
"为什么 Keel 想要她的孩子？"

"He saw the child as a threat, that child is the first of a new line of humans. Genetically engineered to be resistant to disease, to be resistant to us and to be very much like yourself and Ikari. It was a desperation manoeuvre by Gendo which may have placed you all in unnecessary danger but it was one that he deemed necessary."  
"他将那个孩子视为威胁，那个孩子是新一代人类的开端。通过基因工程设计，他们能抵抗疾病，抵抗我们，并且与你和碇司令极为相似。这是碇司令在绝望中采取的策略，虽然可能将你们置于不必要的危险之中，但他认为这是必要的。"

Asuka could barely hide her anger, she had begun to actually trust Gendo but now hearing this she didn't know any more. Her thoughts wandered across to Shinji, did he know about this too now? If their minds were connected there was the chance he might know about it. She turned to Ayanami and questioned her further.  
明日香几乎无法掩饰她的愤怒，她开始真正信任碇司令，但现在听到这些，她已经不确定了。她的思绪飘向了真嗣，他现在也知道这件事吗？如果他们的心灵相连，他有可能已经知道了。她转向绫波，进一步质问她。

"Why a child though, why not more people like me and Shinji who were already grown? Surely Keel would have known a baby would be unable to fight."  
"但为什么是孩子呢，为什么不选择更多像我和真嗣这样已经长大的人？基尔肯定知道一个婴儿是无法战斗的。"

"That is correct but Keel was paranoid, the child was a potential threat so he wanted it. That child though is not alone, there are more in the world that will be like it. A new race of humanity, however unfair it may seem you and Shinji must ensure that they survive. When you return Keel and the others will hunt you down, they will use the bodies of those humans that did not return against you and when they do you must be ready to fight back."  
"没错，但基尔多疑，那孩子是个潜在威胁，所以他想要。不过那孩子并不孤单，世界上还有更多像它一样的存在。一种新的人类种族，尽管这听起来可能不公平，但你和真嗣必须确保他们存活。当你回来时，基尔和其他人会追捕你们，他们会利用那些未能回归的人类身体来对付你们，而当那一刻到来时，你们必须准备好反击。"

It sounded so strange, so bizarre that this person...that Rei was talking to her like this. This was not the Rei that Asuka had known but at the same time she could see it was. She was still there but something else had taken hold. Asuka nodded.  
这听起来太奇怪了，太不可思议了，这个人...丽竟然这样和她说话。这不是阿斯卡认识的丽，但同时她又能看出这就是丽。她还在那里，但某种东西已经占据了主导。阿斯卡点点头。

"We'll fight back, we've came too far to give up now."  
"我们会反击的，我们已经走得太远，现在不能放弃。"

**-------------**

**Shoreline 海岸线**

Shinji opened his eyes and looked out across the sea, it was still night time but he could see huge white flashes in the sky. In the distance he thought he could make out the faint image of Rei Ayanami but when he blinked it was gone.  
真嗣睁开眼睛，望向大海，夜色依旧，但他能看到天空中巨大的白色闪光。远处，他以为自己隐约看到了绫波零的身影，但眨眼间便消失了。

_'Must have been my imagination...'  
“一定是我的幻觉……”_

He slowly turned his head to the right and saw, in the distance, another figure lying down. Her red hair scattered around her head. Shinji scrambled to his feet but found himself unable to carry his own weight. He resorted to crawling over towards her and knelt beside her.  
他缓缓将头转向右侧，远远望见另一道身影躺卧在地。她的红发四散在头周围。真嗣挣扎着站起身，却发现难以承受自身的重量，只得改为匍匐前行，跪在她身旁。

_'Asuka...is this really her? Is this real, am I actually back?'  
'明日香...这真的是她吗？这是真实的吗，我真的回来了吗？'_

He reached out with his hand and gently stroked the woman's forehead, it was warm and it was definitely real. She didn't stir though, he decided for a moment just to leave her and let her rest. He looked out across the shore and into the distance. Everything was silent, it didn't seem like there was a living thing for miles around but he was fine with that. They would return in time and when they did he would be ready. They would rebuild and they would continue to fight back.  
他伸出手，轻抚女子的额头，温暖而真实。然而她并未醒来，他决定暂时让她休息。他眺望海岸线，远方的景象一片寂静，似乎方圆数里内毫无生机，但他对此感到安心。他们终将归来，届时他将做好准备。他们将重建家园，继续抗争。

He took a brief look at Asuka again and smiled before laying himself down next to her, he put his arm round her and held her close to him. He didn't know how she would take it when she did wake up but at the moment he didn't care. She was all he wanted right now, to be close to him and to be next to him.  
他再次短暂地看了明日香一眼，微笑着在她身边躺下，伸出胳膊环绕着她，将她紧紧拥入怀中。他不知道她醒来后会如何反应，但此刻他并不在乎。此刻他只想要她，靠近他，陪伴在他身边。

Ayanami's words were still etched into his mind though, '_You must understand though that not everyone will feel the same way you do. The majority will wish to remain in their perfect worlds. These people will over time become your enemies as my enemies use them to fight against you. You must be prepared to make choices you may not like.'_  
绫波的话依然深深印在他的脑海中，‘你必须明白，并非每个人都与你感受相同。大多数人希望留在他们完美的世界里。随着时间推移，这些人将成为你的敌人，我的敌人会利用他们来对抗你。你必须准备好做出可能不喜欢的选择。’

He thought about it, would he be able to fight against people he once knew if it came down to it? Would he be able to defend himself, he had already seen situations in the past where he hadn't been able to and it has cost people their lives. Would he be faced with decisions like that again?  
他思考着，如果真的到了那一步，他能否与曾经认识的人为敌？他能否保护自己，他已见识过过去无法应对的局面，那曾让许多人丧命。他是否会再次面临那样的抉择？

"You know Shinji...if you keep thinking like that then you won't be ready."  
"你知道吗，真嗣...如果你一直这样想，你就无法准备好。"

He jumped a little when he heard Asuka's words, he must not have been aware that he was thinking out loud nor must he have been aware that she had woken up.  
听到明日香的话，他吓了一跳，他一定没有意识到自己在自言自语，也没有意识到她已经醒了。

"How long have you been awake?"  
"你醒了多久了？"

She grinned, "Since you put your arm around me...I would have said something but I knew you weren't going to rape me so I didn't mind. We're the only two here...we're the last two people on Earth for this moment in time."  
她咧嘴一笑，"既然你把手臂搭在我身上...我本想说些什么，但我知道你不会侵犯我，所以我并不介意。这里只有我们两个人...在这个时刻，我们是地球上最后两个人。"

"I know...it's unusual. They'll return though...I made sure they would...in time they'll all return to us."  
"我知道...这很不同寻常。但他们会回来的...我确保了他们会...随着时间的推移，他们都会回到我们身边。"

She reached up and kissed him, taking him by surprise, he returned the kiss wrapping his arms around her and gently stroking her body. She pulled away and whispered too him "Congratulations Shinji."  
她伸手吻了他，让他有些措手不及，他回吻着，双臂环绕着她，轻轻抚摸她的身体。她退开一步，低声对他说："恭喜你，真嗣。"

**A/N:** Wow thirty chapters and it's finally over. Not to mention this is my longest chapter ever so that's pretty good. This has taken up a good portion of my time over the past year or so but it's been worth it. I loved writing this, making improvement with every chapter I wrote and seeing people's reactions to it. The ending was difficult to write as you would imagine, I'd like to think I did a good job with it and that the people reading it will enjoy it.  
作者注：哇，三十章了，终于完结了。更不用说这是我有史以来最长的一章，相当不错。过去一年左右的时间里，这部作品占据了我相当多的时间，但这一切都是值得的。我喜欢写作，每一章都在进步，并看到人们对它的反应。结尾部分写起来很困难，我想我做得不错，希望读者们会喜欢。

Before I go on there are two people I'd really really like to thank for this. The first of which would be my girlfriend Charly. Not really much to say really, she had supported the fic and read a good chunk of it. She is also responsible for drawing the fic's version of Asuka and Shinji. If you would like to see it then it is available for viewing on her DeviantArt page, her username there is LadyMyrina and the picture is simply titled conspiracy. This is something she didn't have to do but did for me, and I really appreciate it. For being so awesome and supportive, I'm dedicating this chapter specifically to her.  
在我继续之前，有两个人我特别想感谢。首先是我的女朋友查理。其实没什么好说的，她一直支持这部同人作品，并阅读了大部分内容。她还负责绘制了这部同人中明日香和真嗣的形象。如果你想看的话，可以在她的 DeviantArt 页面上找到，她的用户名是 LadyMyrina，图片简单地命名为 conspiracy。她本不必这么做，但她为我做了，我真的很感激。为了她的出色和支持，我特别将这一章献给她。

The second of which would be my pre reader Ste, the same guy who pre read my previous fic Strange New Worlds. Ste is an awesome guy who has had to put up with my endless number of grammatical mistakes and confusion over the then/than. He had taken time out of his life to read this when he could be doing something better. I really appreciate that and I'm glad to have a friend like that.  
其中第二位是我的预读者 Ste，也就是预读过我之前作品《陌生新世界》的那位朋友。Ste 是个非常棒的人，他忍受了我无数的语法错误和对'then/than'的混淆。他在百忙之中抽出时间来阅读这篇作品，而我深感感激，很高兴能有这样的朋友。

Third of which is the cheesy one, all the people who had read this fic and reviewed and everything. J.G, Dartz, Himonky, Hououza and anyone else who has commented on it. Thank you so much, your words and comments mean a lot to me and any advice and criticism that was given was taken on board and employed.  
第三位是那些温馨的读者们，所有阅读过这篇作品并留下评论的朋友们。J.G、Dartz、Himonky、Hououza，以及所有发表过评论的其他人。非常感谢你们，你们的言语和评论对我意义重大，任何建议和批评我都已接受并付诸实践。

Anyway like I said I hope you enjoyed this fic, please don't hesitate to leave a review or contact me.  
总之，正如我所说，希望你们喜欢这篇作品，请不要犹豫留下评论或与我联系。

### Comment
[bittersweet-stories](https://m.fanfiction.net/u/12389913/bittersweet-stories): This story has been on my mind for days. I do not think I will ever emotionally recover from this story. Thank you for this literature piece of gift. I hope you take care and are doing good, wherever you are.  
苦乐参半的故事：这个故事在我脑海中萦绕多日。我想我永远无法从这情感冲击中恢复。感谢你这份文学馈赠。无论你身在何处，愿你保重，一切安好。

**Guest**: I have no idea why I suddenly decide to read an almost 2 decade old fanfic, but got to say I love it. The Asuka here is much stronger, the Shinji here still got some annoying tendency (and still shows…) despite being adult, though at least everything work out at the end.  
访客：我也不知道为什么突然决定读一篇近二十年前的同人小说，但不得不说我很喜欢。这里的明日香更加坚强，这里的真嗣虽然仍有令人讨厌的倾向（而且依然存在……），尽管已经成年，但至少最终一切都有了圆满的结局。

By the way, not sure if I’m imagine things but I feel like there is a manga that’s post rebuild 3.01.0 with similar concept (though of course with Shkinami instead of Saroyu)  
顺便一提，不确定是不是我臆想，但我觉得好像有一部漫画，是关于《新世纪福音战士新剧场版：破》之后的，概念相似（当然，是以真希波代替了纱罗妪）

[y2nad](https://m.fanfiction.net/u/15721726/y2nad): This was certainly one of the better AUs I've read through. I'm not sure if the older spin-off video game and manga have anything to do with your inspiration for this but I honestly would've rathered had them based on this story lol. Your sense of world-building, plot, and setting were quite excellent in developing a parallel to the original story. The slight deviations and twists on the characters themselves were also neat, I always like when someone builds off the characters being slightly older and more mature, offers uncharted land in my opinion. My only issues would be inconsistency in pacing and deus ex machina/retconning with how often characters just went "missing" or were conveniently absent/present from the plot just to pad for development while keeping parallel to the OG timeline. However, the in-depth analysis of the mind games between NERV and SEELE were well orchestrated and written, combined well with the "mystery" aspect of the investigations. And the decision to make the parents not completely pragmatic, sociopaths to give depth behind why they did what they did helped give the story a better ending alongside a chance to mend the relationships. The neat cherry on top. Going to continue reading through the rest of your works.  
y2nad：这无疑是我读过的更出色的同人宇宙之一。我不确定那部较早的衍生视频游戏和漫画是否对你的创作有所启发，但我真心希望它们能基于这个故事改编，哈哈。你在世界构建、情节和背景设定方面的造诣相当出色，成功打造了一个与原作平行的故事。角色本身的细微偏差和转折也处理得很好，我一向喜欢看到角色因年龄增长而更显成熟，这在我看来开辟了新的探索领域。唯一的问题在于节奏的不一致性，以及频繁使用机械降神/时间线重置手法，角色时而“失踪”，时而为了剧情发展而方便地缺席或出现，以保持与原时间线的平行。然而，NERV 与 SEELE 之间心理博弈的深入剖析写得相当精彩，与调查的“神秘”元素结合得恰到好处。此外，让父母角色不完全冷酷无情，赋予他们行为背后的深层动机，不仅为故事增添了深度，也为关系的修复提供了可能，使得结局更加圆满。 完美的点睛之笔。我会继续阅读你的其他作品。

**Y U BERZERK**: I blame the Angels for this whole mess! Those eldritch abominations are always being monsters and generally screwing up human events.  
Y U 狂暴：这一切混乱都怪那些天使！那些诡异的可憎之物总是作恶多端，还总是搅乱人类的事务。

[J.G. The Gamer](https://m.fanfiction.net/u/854343/J-G-The-Gamer): And so it ends. And so it ends. Almost a year in the making. I know how you said it would be a difficult one to end after so much work.  
J.G. 游戏玩家：就这样结束了。就这样结束了。几乎历时一年。我知道你说过，在投入这么多心血之后，要收尾会很难。

Interesting take on the Instrumentality project, with having Shinji understand that his imaginary world just isn't real. Kind of reminded me of the Matrix in a way. That and the Rei clone was the key to setting the whole thing off.  
对人类补完计划的独特解读，让真嗣意识到他幻想中的世界并非真实。某种程度上让我想起了《黑客帝国》。还有就是，丽这个克隆体是整个事件的关键。

LOL, I think I got an idea of who those nine nutcases who could take more lead than pitbulls were based on. Shame Asuka didn't get to defeat them though.  
哈哈，我想我知道那九个比斗牛犬还能承受子弹的疯子是基于谁了。可惜明日香没能打败他们。

I sort of feel the whole thing was a little rushed though. I may be wrong however, but I was hoping to see more of the battles and the invasion and such. Well an agent's life usually is behind the scenes, fighting in the shadows, winning the battles that no one sees. But one only sees that the peace is still kept through these shadow wars.  
我总觉得整个故事有点仓促。虽然我可能错了，但我本希望能看到更多战斗和入侵的场景。毕竟，特工的生活通常是幕后操作，在阴影中战斗，赢得无人知晓的战役。但正是这些隐秘的战争，维系着和平。

And in the end, Shinji gets the girl. YAY! I almost wish there was an epilogue chapter to this to get a little closure all around for everyone else involved in this cataclysmic war. But I can deal with this ending as is.  
最终，真嗣赢得了女孩的心。耶！我几乎希望这里有一个尾声章节，以便为这场灾难性战争中的每个人带来一点圆满的结局。但我可以接受这样的结局。

Despite my frustrations you know I've had with this story, and the numerous threats I've made on your life. I cannot argue that this story was MUCH better than SNW by about a dozen miles. I give this story a 9.7/100. Probably perhaps this came out better than SNW because mystery and the such is right up your alley. I didn't worry too much about grammar because I have difficulties myself catching grammar errors... so says MBS. But your spelling was bang on and I was fine with it. I liked the way your story was written so much, that I've actually wanted to incorporate a bit of your style into my own works.  
尽管我对这个故事感到沮丧，并且对你发出了无数次的生命威胁。我不得不承认，这个故事比《星际迷航：下一代》好上十几倍。我给这个故事打 9.7 分。也许这比《星际迷航：下一代》更好，因为神秘和这类题材正是你的强项。我没有过多担心语法，因为我自己也很困难地捕捉语法错误...所以 MBS 这么说。但你的拼写非常准确，我很满意。我非常喜欢你的写作风格，以至于我实际上想将你的风格融入到我自己的作品中。

Can't wait for the next story JCM. Hopefully it'll be just as good.  
迫不及待想看 JCM 的下一部作品了。希望它同样精彩。

[J.G. The Gamer J.G.](https://m.fanfiction.net/u/854343/J-G-The-Gamer): Oh joy, Asuka and Rei have been captured AGAIN. And I guess this is where they face Armisael, the 16th Messenger.  
J.G. 游戏者 J.G.: 哦，天哪，明日香和绫波又被抓了，又是老套路。我猜这次他们要面对的是第 16 使徒亚米沙尔。

Asuka sure is tough, hanging in there despite the hell she went through a chapter prior. But one knows being tough can only get you so far... something like an overheated car on the verge of breakdown.  
明日香确实坚韧，尽管上一章经历了那么多磨难，她依然坚持着。但我们都知道，仅凭坚韧是远远不够的...就像一辆即将崩溃的过热汽车。

Shinji's close, but close sometimes isn't enough. I can tell the Endgame is near. Where the final moves will be made, and the showdown will commence for the fate of humanity.  
真嗣已经很接近了，但有时候接近并不足够。我能感觉到终局即将来临。届时将做出最后的决策，为人类的命运展开最终的对决。

**Adam**: I like how you've developed Gendo's character. You didn't cop out and make him pure bastard like I've seen people do far too often. Plotwise, your story continues to improve itself each chapter; Shinji and Asuka's relationship is developing smoothly. About the only problem I see with "Conspiracy" involves spelling.  
亚当：我喜欢你如何塑造源堂这个角色。你没有回避，没有像我常看到的那样把他塑造成一个纯粹的混蛋。从情节上看，你的故事每一章都在不断进步；真嗣和明日香的关系也在平稳发展。关于《阴谋》唯一的问题，我觉得是拼写方面。

[Himonky](https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1044323/Himonky): It is a bit slower, but really introspective into Asuka. Her whole world is collapsing with Shinji gone, and you've done an excellent job of showing that.  
Himonky：节奏是慢了些，但确实深入到了明日香的内心。她的整个世界随着真嗣的离去而崩塌，你很好地展现了这一点。

First scene wasn't great, but not bad. It put some intrigue on the table and got things moving. Kaji and Asuka's relationship had some light shown onto it here.  
第一幕虽然不算精彩，但也并不糟糕。它带来了一些悬念，让事情开始动起来。加持和明日香的关系在这里有了一些展现。

I loved the Gendo/Fuyutsuki scene. Lots of hints here and some real character development for the two of them. For the first time, Asuka is said to be as important to the scenario as the other two. While it's definately interesting, I don't know what to think about this. Part of what I like about her is the under-dog mentality I can get about her.  
我非常喜欢源堂和冬月的那个场景。这里有很多暗示，两人的角色发展也很真实。第一次，明日香被提到在这个情境中与另外两人同样重要。虽然这确实很有趣，但我不知道该怎么想。我喜欢她的一部分原因，就是那种我能感受到的弱者心态。

Rei's return created some sparks. I think with her final revelation to Asuka, Asuka should probably calm down and get over it. She does sort of owe Rei, although I doubt she would see it that way. Also, a very good reason for why Rei left NERV in the first place.  
丽回来时确实激起了一些火花。我认为随着她对明日香的最终启示，明日香应该会冷静下来并释怀。她确实欠丽一些东西，尽管我怀疑她是否会这么看。此外，这也是丽当初离开 NERV 的一个很好的理由。

And Marduk's statement comes out. I'm surprised you had him return so suddenly like this, but it's good. Kaji's certainty and then being wrong is also well done, showing that he doesn't know nearly as much as he thought he did.  
然后马杜克的声明出来了。你让他这么突然地回来让我有点惊讶，但这样做很好。加持的自信然后又出错也处理得很好，显示出他并不像自己以为的那样了解一切。

Dead ends all around. The "doomed from the start" mentality you've given the whole chapter fits really well with the way you ended it. NERV didn't get organized, so they've gotten nothing accomplished. Can't say I blame them though, since there's really no place to start.  
四处碰壁。你给整个章节赋予的“注定失败”心态与结尾方式非常契合。NERV 未能组织起来，所以他们一事无成。不过，我并不怪他们，毕竟真的无从下手。

Good update. Things are clicking along nicely and I do wonder what you're going to do with Shinji. A part of me thinks he might not come back for a long while, if at all...  
更新很棒。事情进展顺利，我确实好奇你会如何处理真嗣。我的一部分认为他可能不会很快回来，甚至可能根本不回来……

My guess for the next chapter is either Shinji's thoughts/life during this same time period or possibly Arael's assault. Definately looking forward to it.  
我猜测下一章要么是真嗣在这个时期的想法/生活，或者是 Arael 的攻击。非常期待。

[Kaliaila](https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1153149/Kaliaila): Interesting few chapters. Seeing both completely original developments in the story and characters as well as more from both of the original canon stories.  
卡利亚拉：这几章颇为有趣。既有故事和角色全新的发展，也融入了两部原作的更多元素。

The double agent and the woman being pregnant after being told she can't have children from the X-files side. Foreshadowing of the next few angels as well as the introduction of the last angel into the story and him telling us that they are now working with Seele, or more to the point Keel (as I really doubt he told the comittee about his deal with them).  
双面间谍与被告知无法生育却怀孕的女性，这一情节来自《X 档案》。预示着接下来几位天使的登场，以及最后一位天使的引入，他告诉我们他们现在正与 Seele 合作，更确切地说是与基尔（我怀疑他并未向委员会透露与他们的交易）。

Lots of character development in completely original directions too. Rei questioning her purpose and really her entire world as opposed to how she was always sure of it in cannon. So much so that Keel would go so far as to blatantly try and recruit her to undermind Gendo. Shinji and Asuka actually reaching out to each other and being the support the other never had in the original Eva series. Also once again see Gendo showing pride and trust in Shinji, but still quick to dismiss it as nothing.  
角色发展也呈现出全新的方向。丽开始质疑自己的目的，乃至整个世界观，这与她在原作中始终坚定不移的形象截然不同。基尔甚至明目张胆地试图招募她来削弱碇源堂的势力。真嗣和明日香真正向彼此伸出援手，成为对方在原版《EVA》中未曾拥有的支持。同时，碇源堂再次表现出对真嗣的骄傲与信任，但转瞬又将之视为无物。

Lots to look forward to and wonder about in the coming chapters. The committee thinks they are going to be the leaders of the new world, but Keel knows different. What is Keel's actual agenda? What is the scenario that Gendo is working to steer Shinji towards? What role will Misato's "impossible" pregnancy have in the story, something similiar to the X-files original, something more Eva, or another original tangent? Will the bonds that Shinji and Asuka seem to be forming with each other be enough to counter avert the plans their opponents have for them?  
接下来的章节中有很多值得期待和思考的内容。委员会认为他们将成为新世界的领导者，但基尔知道事实并非如此。基尔的真实议程是什么？碇源堂正在努力引导真嗣走向何种局面？美里那看似不可能的怀孕将在故事中扮演什么角色，是类似《X 档案》原作的情节，还是更加《EVA》风格，亦或是另辟蹊径的原创发展？真嗣和明日香之间似乎正在形成的羁绊，是否足以对抗对手为他们设下的计划？

Great job so far using the best of both series with plenty of original ideas to keep it all from being predictable. Just keep them coming.  
到目前为止做得非常出色，融合了两部系列作品的精华，并融入了大量原创想法，使其不落俗套。请继续保持这样的创作。

[Himonky](https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1044323/Himonky): Now that was one hell of a chapter. I'd thought I'd seen that you were going to deepen the conspiracy, but this is more like a sunken city in the antarctic. I thought you'd peaked in the last chapter...not even close.  
Himonky：这真是一个令人震撼的章节。我本以为你会加深阴谋的层次，但这更像是在南极发现的一座沉没城市。我以为上一章已经是巅峰了...结果还远未触及极限。

SPOILERS  剧透警告

Only very rarely in fics do I second guess events. I'm very much wondering whether or not Spencer is telling the truth or not. If Shinji has had a coma for that long...this fic is going to be completely different from what I'd expected.  
在同人文中，我很少对事件产生怀疑。但我现在非常想知道 Spencer 是否在说实话。如果 Shinji 已经昏迷了那么久...这篇同人文将会与我预期的完全不同。

The way I see it, there are two likely ways for you to take this. One is keeping the focus in 2015. Shinji may go back in time somehow. A lot of weird stuff has happened, so I don't doubt this as a possibility. If he doesn't go back and you keep the focus in 2015, he's more or less dead. It wouldn't wreck it...but it would certainly change a great many things.  
依我看，你有两种可能的处理方式。一种是将焦点保持在 2015 年。Shinji 可能会以某种方式回到过去。发生了很多奇怪的事情，所以我并不怀疑这种可能性。如果他没有回去，而你仍然将焦点保持在 2015 年，那他基本上算是死了。这不会毁掉故事...但肯定会改变很多事情。

Or you might have this in the future, where Shinji has just woken up. I'm not really sure what to expect if you go by this route. Maybe a sort of Post Third Impact fic?  
或者你可能会遇到这样的未来，真嗣刚刚醒来。如果走这条路线，我真不确定会发生什么。或许是某种《第三次冲击》后的故事？

Good chewing out of Asuka by Rei. A nice seudo-Instrumentality scene for Shinji at the beginning.  
丽对明日香的一番严厉训斥。开头为真嗣营造了一个美好的伪神识场景。

Big step up JCM. Can't complain about grammar or spelling here either. Now I'm going to be a nervous reck if you don't get more up soon.  
JCM 大步向前。语法和拼写方面也无可挑剔。现在如果你不尽快更新更多内容，我就要紧张得不行了。

[Himonky](https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1044323/Himonky): Now I understand why you've said you were looking forward to writing this chapter. I had to get on you for chapter 15 because I knew you could do better. And better you have done. Nice return to form here.  
Himonky：现在我明白为什么你说期待写这一章了。第 15 章时我还得催促你，因为我知道你能做得更好。而你确实做得更好了。这里的表现很出色。

SPOILERS  剧透警告

Major trust issues between Shinji and Asuka. For once Shinji is on the outside, with Asuka knowing more than him. He certainly doesn't seem to like this. He seemed a little selfish when he thought he wanted Leliel all to himself. Also, a bit of his old (new?) spinless self in the beginning when he didn't want to take the case. The slap and kiss have had much larger reprecussions than I'd expected.  
真嗣和明日香之间存在严重的信任问题。这一次，真嗣处于被动，明日香知道的比他多。他显然不喜欢这种情况。当他以为自己想要独占雷里尔时，他显得有些自私。此外，在案件开始时，他那旧有的（新的？）无主见的一面也显露出来。那一记耳光和亲吻带来的后果远比我所预料的要严重得多。

Starring into the abyss in the man's eyes. I've always been attracted to writing like this. You've also dropped vague hints of a much deeper conspiracy than has been previously shown by Kensuke and the man's questioning of reality. There may be a much bigger chasm than I'd previously expected...  
凝视着男人眼中的深渊。我一直被这样的写作所吸引。你也隐晦地暗示了一个比之前健介和男人对现实的质疑所展现的更深层次的阴谋。可能存在一个比我所预料的更大的深渊...

The dummy plug: I wonder how exactly you're going to get this to work. Mind control comes to mind, or perhaps body swapping. Should be interesting, looking ahead a bit.  
替身插头：我很好奇你究竟打算如何实现这一点。可能是心灵控制，或者是身体交换。应该会很有趣，期待后续发展。

A bit more development of Touji and Kensuke than you've previously had. They were less background and more primary characters in this chapter. Perhaps NERV will offer them jobs after this. Touji specifically.  
相较于之前的章节，对东治和真希波的描写更为深入。他们在这章中不再是背景角色，而是更为重要的主要角色。或许在这之后，NERV 会给他们提供工作，特别是东治。

Shinji's injection with something...I wonder if it's an 'antidote' to the previous serums he's been given or some other sort of serum. The betrayal was also very nicely well done. Based on canon, he's going to free himself...but I'd personally like to see Asuka kick some ass. Not likely though I suppose.  
真嗣被注射了某种东西……我猜这可能是之前他接受过的血清的‘解药’，或者是另一种血清。背叛的情节处理得非常到位。根据原作，他会自救……但我个人更想看到明日香大显身手。不过，这似乎不太可能。

Asuka's cold exterior flaunts itself. You have her blaiming Shinji a little bit more harshly than in canon. But you also have her soft interior coming out. Her crying and getting mad at Shinji for going in without her testify to this. I wonder if she'll have a mirror to her talk in the canon with Rei.  
明日香冷酷的外表展露无遗。你让她对真嗣的责怪比原作中更为严厉。但同时，她的柔软内心也逐渐显露。她哭泣并因真嗣独自行动而对他发怒，这正印证了这一点。我好奇她是否会与原作中与绫波的对话形成某种镜像。

Interesting use of Gendo as well. It was brief, but you did show that he really cares about Rei. Good work.  
对碇源堂的运用也颇有趣味。虽然简短，但你确实展现了他对绫波的关心。做得好。

Grammar was much better, though there is always room for improvement. Some sentances seem to be very long and with a lot of commas. For example: "All three of them sat for a brief moment in silence, Touji looking at him, a serious expression on his face, Kensuke however was grinning." I think you might want to have "All three of them sat for a brief moment in silence, Touji looking at him with a serious expression on his face. Kensuke however was grinning." I think the main thing would just be to try to cut back on the commas. Some sections were really good on this, others they would flare up a bit. It could just be me though.  
语法有了很大改进，但仍有提升空间。有些句子似乎过长且逗号过多。例如：“他们三人沉默地坐了一会儿，东治看着他，脸上带着严肃的表情，而真希波却在咧嘴笑。”我觉得你可以改成：“他们三人沉默地坐了一会儿，东治带着严肃的表情看着他。而真希波却在咧嘴笑。”主要就是尽量减少逗号的使用。有些部分在这方面做得很好，其他部分则稍显繁琐。可能只是我的个人看法。

Overall, major improvement from the last chapter. I really like this chapter and I think you were right to say it has major importance in your plot. Things are going to take a turn for the worst for Shinji and co., but it certainly makes for more interesting reading. I look forward to 17.  
总体而言，比上一章有了显著进步。我非常喜欢这一章，也认为你所说的它在你的剧情中具有重大意义是正确的。对于真嗣等人来说，事情即将急转直下，但这无疑让阅读变得更加引人入胜。我期待着第 17 章。
