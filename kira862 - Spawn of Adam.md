### Chapter 1: The Demon From Hell  
第一章：来自地狱的恶魔  

Disclaimer: I don't own Neon Genesis Evangelion, any of the characters, or any of the stuff relating to the franchise.  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》，也不拥有其中的任何角色或与该系列相关的任何内容。

Rated M for: Strong Language, Violence, blood and gore (in later chapter), and adult themes.  
分级为 M，原因包括：强烈的语言、暴力、血腥和恐怖（在后续章节中），以及成人主题。

**Well I finally got around to posting my story of Evangelion. So here is the first chapter. One of the things that made NGE so interesting was the relationships between the characters. Though it was also because of the psychological aspects which made in interesting to me. I try to stick close to the core of what made it interesting by having the characters question themselves in their own minds and of course developing the love-hate relationship of Shinji and Asuka. And without further ado I give you Spawn of Adam.  
好吧，我终于抽出时间来发布我的《福音战士》故事了。以下是第一章。《新世纪福音战士》之所以引人入胜，其中一个原因在于角色之间的关系。当然，心理层面的描绘也让我觉得它非常有趣。我试图紧扣使其有趣的本质，让角色们在内心深处自我质疑，并自然地发展出真嗣和明日香之间爱恨交织的关系。废话不多说，现在就为您呈现《亚当的子嗣》。**

**Update: 12/26/14.  更新日期：12/26/14。**

**So I've long known that Spawn of Adam has its fair share of problems, from its many grammatical errors, to the early interactions between Shinji and Asuka being somewhat out of place compared to how things started to take shape. With that said, I'm gonna begin re-uploading each chapter, fixing mistakes, and overall rewriting some stuff. In this chapter in particular I've completely changed the first interaction between them so that Asuka's been toned way down compared to how she initially acted.  
我早就知道《亚当的子嗣》存在不少问题，从诸多语法错误，到真嗣和明日香早期的互动与后来逐渐成形的情节相比显得有些突兀。话虽如此，我打算开始重新上传每一章，修正错误，并整体上重写一些内容。特别是这一章，我彻底改变了他们第一次互动的情节，让明日香的行为比最初的表现要收敛得多。**

Shinji Ikari looked out the window from where he sat in his homeroom class. It had been raining for close to a week now, and the rain depicted what his mood felt like right now: miserable. Shinji had never cared much for a social life and shunned people away when they got to close to him. He preferred to sit in class and listen to his SDAT while the teacher ran through the normal, boring routine of lecturing without pause. His teacher had gotten tired of having to put up with Shinji's constant absences, and him not paying attention in class and just acted like his seat was empty. Shinji didn't care anymore whether he wanted him there or not. He just came to school and slept whenever his roommate at home became too much of a pain in the ass to deal with.  
碇真嗣坐在教室里，目光投向窗外。雨已经下了将近一周，这雨正如他此刻的心情：凄凉。真嗣向来不热衷于社交生活，每当有人试图靠近，他便避之不及。他更愿意坐在教室里，听着 SDAT，任由老师无休止地进行那枯燥乏味的讲课。他的老师早已厌倦了真嗣频繁的缺席和课堂上心不在焉的态度，仿佛他的座位空无一人。真嗣已不再在乎老师是否希望他留在那里。他来学校只是为了逃避，每当家里的室友变得难以忍受时，他就在课堂上打盹。

Shinji sighed and continued to look out the window. He had received an envelope this morning from his father stating that he would be moving the next day. That was one reason why Shinji never had a social life. His father who worked at the Nerv facilities somewhere in Tokyo-3, constantly kept his son moving from apartment to apartment not letting him stay in the same place very long. Shinji hated his father for this, and the fact that he hadn't even seen him for over a year. His father had abandoned him to go work on his stupid Nerv projects, 'Whatever those were,' thought Shinji.  
真嗣叹了口气，继续望向窗外。今早他收到了父亲的一封信，说明天就要搬家了。这也是真嗣从未有过社交生活的原因之一。在东京-3 某处 NERV 设施工作的父亲，不断让儿子从一个公寓搬到另一个公寓，不让他长时间待在同一个地方。真嗣为此憎恨父亲，更因为已经超过一年没见过他了。父亲为了那些愚蠢的 NERV 项目抛弃了他，“管它是什么呢，”真嗣心想。

He continued to look out the window when he heard the bell ring, signaling the start of lunch. 'God damn this day,' he thought. 'I wish it would just hurry up and be over with so I can go to my next home. I can just hope that it'll be better than what I'm stuck with now.'  
他继续望着窗外，这时铃声响起，标志着午餐时间的开始。“该死的今天，”他心想，“真希望它能快点结束，这样我就可以去下一个家了。我只希望它比我现在被困的地方要好。”

He was the last one to get up from his chair and walked swiftly past the teacher as he shot Shinji a scowl. 'Don't even think he bothered to write my name down on the register. Though it doesn't matter now. I'm leaving so I won't be seeing him any more.'  
他是最后一个从椅子上站起来的人，迅速走过老师身边，老师对真嗣投以怒视。“他甚至可能都没在名册上写下我的名字。不过现在无所谓了。我要离开了，不会再见到他了。”

---

Leaving the school grounds, he suddenly wished he would have just stayed put. Within minutes of exiting the school, he was soaked to the bone and his clothes felt like they were weighing him down a few extra pounds.  
离开学校后，他突然希望自己刚才没有动。刚走出校门几分钟，他就被淋得浑身湿透，衣服感觉像是重了几磅，压得他喘不过气来。

Shinji however didn't want to go home, or what he called a home right now. Later, he would get back, pack up, and simply wait for tomorrow to come. He didn't feel like facing his roommate right now. This morning they had gotten into a shouting match over last nights party that had been held. Shinji had come back from strolling the streets of Tokyo-3 to find his room a mess, empty bear bottles littering the floor, and the smell of vomit lingering. Worst of all, he was stuck disinfecting the whole place, and now just this morning he found out he was leaving.  
然而，真嗣并不想回家，或者说他现在称之为家的地方。晚些时候，他会回去收拾行李，然后简单地等待明天的到来。他现在不想面对他的室友。今早他们因为昨晚的派对吵了起来。真嗣从东京-3 的街头漫步回来，发现房间一片狼藉，满地都是空啤酒瓶，呕吐物的气味挥之不去。最糟糕的是，他不得不负责整个地方的消毒工作，而现在就在今早，他得知自己要离开了。

'Should have left the idiot to clean the mess up himself,' he thought bitterly.  
“早知道就让那傻瓜自己收拾烂摊子了。”他苦涩地想。

Most of his time spent in Tokyo-3, he had taken long walks through the streets and alleyways and he knew the place so well that he could close his eyes and walk by memory. It was one way that he used to escape the reality that he was facing. With his SDAT in hand, he would walk aimlessly through Tokyo until he found a suitable spot to fall asleep. He almost wished that his father would just let him sleep outside. At least he was more content this way.  
在东京-3 度过的多数时光里，他常常漫步于街道和巷弄之间，对这片地方了如指掌，甚至闭上眼睛也能凭记忆行走。这是他逃避现实的一种方式。手持 SDAT，他会漫无目的地穿梭于东京，直到找到一个合适的角落入睡。他几乎希望父亲能让他睡在外面，至少这样他更感满足。

He walked aimlessly for hours until he arrive at a spot that he visited often. He had arrived at the Bay of Tokyo and looked towards the sun which was just starting to set. It was stuff like this that brought him into his own world. Watching the sun, he could forget about everything and just watch until it set. Then, though he would be forced back to the sharp reality that was his life and plunged into his own misery again. 'Its not like its my fault that I'm miserable. All my father ever does is shun me from place to place.'  
他漫无目的地走了几个小时，直到来到一个常去的地方。他来到了东京湾，望着太阳刚刚开始西沉。正是这样的景象让他沉浸在自己的世界里。凝视着夕阳，他可以忘却一切，只是静静地看着它落下。然而，每当太阳沉没，他又会被迫回到那尖锐的现实生活，再次陷入自己的痛苦之中。'我这么痛苦又不是我的错。父亲总是把我从一个地方赶到另一个地方。'

'Ah, but its your decision not to connect with people,' said a small voice in his head.  
'啊，但与人建立联系是你自己的选择，'他脑海中有个细小的声音说道。

'I never get a chance though. I rarely stay at the same school for three months. How the hell am I supposed to connect with people and then stay in contact with them if I move around so much?'  
“但我从未有机会。我很少在一所学校待满三个月。如果我总是四处搬家，我怎么可能与人建立联系并保持联系呢？”

The voice didn't respond as though admitting defeat.  
那个声音没有回应，仿佛承认了失败。

Shinji now laid back against the grassy shore and looked up into the sky, or what he could see of it. Many building towered over him and their tall peaks made it difficult for him to see much of the sky. He felt like they were pressing down around him. 'Damn this city,' he thought. 'There is nothing to do except get drunk, according to my roommate.' Even Shinji had to smile at that thought. 'Probably bending over the toilet right now and feeling his dinner coming up.'  
真嗣现在背靠在草地上，抬头望向天空，或者说他能看到的那部分天空。许多建筑物高耸在他周围，它们的尖顶使得他很难看到更多的天空。他感觉它们像是在他周围压迫下来。‘该死的这座城市，’他想，‘除了喝醉，我的室友说这里什么都没有。’就连真嗣想到这一点也不禁微笑。‘现在大概正弯着腰对着马桶，感受着晚餐涌上来吧。’

Shinji would have liked to continue laying their until the sun finally set but willed himself to get up. Even though he hated his roommate he thought it appropriate to tell him that he would be leaving tomorrow. Pushing himself up into a sitting position he gave one final look at the sun before he turned to go, but then did a double take.  
真嗣本想继续躺着直到太阳最终落下，但还是强迫自己起身。尽管他讨厌室友，他觉得还是应该告诉他明天自己要离开。他用力坐起身，在转身离开前最后看了一眼夕阳，却突然愣住了。

He wasn't sure how long they had been there, but someone was down by the water looking out across the ocean. Shinji squinted his eyes trying to make out who could be down there. Standing up he looked again and saw that it was a girl and she must have been close to his age. She had long red hair that came down to the middle of her back, and her hair was separating into three parts thanks to the hair clips that she wore. She was wearing a simple yellow dress that was blowing against the wind. The contrast between herself and the setting sun in front of her was almost blinding. It was almost as though that fiery red hair and sun dress magnified herself and the sun so that she gave off an eerie orange glow. Shinji wasn't sure what made him do it but he stood there for sometime watching the back of her. He had a sudden urge to go down there and find out who she was, but then shook his head.  
他不确定他们在那里待了多久，但有人在水边眺望着大海。真嗣眯起眼睛试图辨认出那会是谁。他站起来再次望去，发现那是个女孩，年龄应该和他相仿。她有着一头长长的红发，垂至背部中间，发丝因佩戴的发夹而分成三股。她穿着一件简单的黄色连衣裙，随风飘扬。她与前方夕阳的对比几乎令人目眩。仿佛那火红的头发和太阳裙将她与太阳放大，散发出一种诡异的橙色光芒。真嗣不确定是什么驱使他这样做，但他站在那里凝视着她的背影。他突然有种冲动想走下去，弄清楚她是谁，但随即摇了摇头。

"No point," he said softly. "Tomorrow I'll be gone again so theres no point in finding out who she is."  
“没意义，”他轻声说，“明天我又将离开，所以没必要知道她是谁。”

Giving her back one last look he turned and walked back towards his soon to be old apartment. Though the thought of the setting sun and her was constantly on his mind for the rest of the night.  
最后看了一眼她的背影，他转身走回即将成为旧公寓的地方。尽管夕阳和她一直萦绕在他的脑海中，直到深夜。

---

Shinji woke up the next morning and waited outside his roommates door. When he had come home last night he had found him sleeping on the couch passed out. Deciding that he would just wait till the next morning, he had packed what little things he owned, and went to sleep.  
第二天早上，真嗣醒来后便站在室友的房门外等候。昨晚回家时，他发现室友醉倒在沙发上睡着了。决定等到第二天早上再说，他收拾了自己仅有的几样东西，便去睡了。

Now he was leaning against his roommates door with his bag in his hand waiting for him to get up. Shinji sighed and looked down at his watch. He was supposed to meet this Misato Katsuragi in the next few hours. Shinji frowned at the name of this unidentified person. From the sound of it she was a women, and Shinji hadn't had a woman as a roommate, yet.  
现在，他倚靠在室友的房门上，手里提着包，等待对方起床。真嗣叹了口气，低头看了看手表。他应该在接下来的几个小时内与这位葛城美里见面。真嗣对这个未曾谋面的人的名字皱了皱眉。听起来她是个女性，而真嗣还从未与女性同住过。

'Well, anything is probably better than what I'm stuck with right now,' he thought.  
“嗯，不管怎样，总比我现在的情况要好吧，”他心想。

Sighing again he slumped down into a sitting position and leaned his head against the door.  
他又叹了口气，颓然坐下，将头靠在门上。

'Ah hurry the hell up, he thought. 'I wanna get this over with.'  
'啊，快点吧，'他心想，'我想赶紧结束这事。'

Shinji wasn't sure how long he sat there waiting for his roommate to wake up, but it must have been at least half an hour. Feeling that he was starting to get drowsy from sitting there for so long, he stood up and turned to face the door. 'Enough. I'm getting his ass up.'  
真嗣不确定自己坐在那里等室友醒来有多久了，但至少有半个小时。感觉自己因为坐得太久而开始犯困，他站起身来，转向门。'够了。我要把他叫起来。'

He swung the door open about to tell his roommate to get the hell up. He was shocked to see that the bed was empty and seemed to have been for several hours.  
他猛地推开门，正准备叫室友起床。却惊讶地发现床上空无一人，似乎已经离开好几个小时了。

"What the hell. This is the first time I've known him to get up early."  
“搞什么鬼。这是我第一次知道他早起。”

Shinji looked at his watch again and knew that he wouldn't be able to tell him in person.  
真嗣再次看了看手表，知道无法当面告诉他了。

"I guess I'll just leave him a note telling him I've left. I'm sure he wont care. He's been talking about having his girlfriend start sleeping over."  
"我想我会给他留张字条，告诉他我已经走了。我肯定他不会在乎的。他一直在说要让他的女朋友开始留宿。"

Shinji looked around and realized how weird it was that he was talking about this out loud to himself and suddenly felt lonely. At least he had had someone to talk to, but now...  
真嗣环顾四周，意识到自己大声谈论这件事有多奇怪，突然感到孤单。至少他曾经有个人可以交谈，但现在...

"It'll work out," he said. Then shook his head and thought, 'I've got to stop talking out loud, its weird."  
"会好起来的，"他说。然后摇了摇头想，'我得停止自言自语，这太奇怪了。"

Walking over to the table he tore off a piece of paper on the notepad that was sitting there and rummaged in his bag to find a pen that would work. Finding one that was suitable he hastily scribbled a quick message about where he was going.  
他走到桌前，从放在那里的便签本上撕下一张纸，然后在包里翻找能用的笔。找到一支合适的笔后，他匆忙地草草写下他要去哪里的信息。

Hey, I see you woke up early, odd. Anyway I'm leaving finally and thought that I should at least tell you about it. I think I told you that I might get moved again by my father, but you might not have been sober at the time. Well, I'm finally leaving now so you don't have to worry about me upsetting your girlfriend when she's over.  
嘿，我看到你早起了，真奇怪。不管怎样，我终于要走了，觉得至少应该告诉你一声。我可能跟你说过我爸可能又要搬家，但当时你可能还没清醒。好吧，我现在真的要走了，这样你就不用担心我会在你女朋友来的时候惹她不高兴了。

Shinji paused here and remembered when he had walked in on the two of them making love. The thought of that still brought stomach acid up his esophagus. Not sure how to finish it now he simply signed his name at the end of it and carried it into his room and placed it on his futon.  
真嗣在这里停顿了一下，回想起他无意中撞见他们做爱的情景。一想到那个，他仍感到胃酸涌上食道。不确定现在该如何结束，他简单地在末尾签上名字，然后拿着纸条走进房间，放在他的被褥上。

Walking back into what was considered the living room, he gave everything one last look before he turned his back on his old home and walked out the door.  
他再次走进被视为客厅的地方，在转身离开旧家之前，他最后环顾了一眼四周，然后走出了门。

---

Shinji walked the quickest way to get to his destination. He had a little under forty-five minutes to get to this cafe where he was supposed to me Misato. Taking many short cuts down alleyways and old gravel roads, he paused for a minute against a street sign catching his breath. His SDAT had repeated itself several times over now and he pulled the earphones out of his ear getting bored with the music.  
真嗣以最快的路线赶往目的地。他还有不到四十五分钟的时间到达那家咖啡馆，他要在那里与美里见面。他穿过许多小巷和老碎石路，抄了近路，在一根路标旁停下来喘口气。他的 SDAT 已经重复播放了好几次，他感到无聊，便把耳机从耳朵里取了出来。

Stuffing it back in his bag he straightened up and swung his bag over his shoulder and continued on to the cafe.  
他把 SDAT 塞回包里，挺直身子，将包甩到肩上，继续向咖啡馆走去。

When Shinji arrived his first impression of it was one of disgust. It was tucked away in a corner of the street and looked as though it was reserved for only the poor. Now though that Shinji looked around he saw that he was in one of the old slums of Tokyo-3. It looked like a shack more than anything. The sign which hung over the front of the cafe was slightly lopsided and the nails that held it to the wood where rusted and obviously strained from the weight on the metal sign. The roof looked as though it had suffered many a battering from past storms and some of the shingles were missing. Shinji figured that it smelled like rot and mold inside and decided to wait outside. Or he felt that he would be mimicking his old roommate and vomiting.  
当真嗣到达时，他对这个地方的第一印象是厌恶。它蜷缩在街道的一角，看起来似乎只留给穷人。然而现在，当真嗣环顾四周，他发现自己身处东京-3 的老旧贫民窟中。它看起来更像是一个棚屋。悬挂在咖啡馆前方的招牌略微倾斜，固定它的钉子锈迹斑斑，显然因金属招牌的重量而承受着压力。屋顶看起来经历过多次暴风雨的摧残，有些瓦片已经缺失。真嗣猜测里面弥漫着腐烂和霉菌的气味，决定在外面等待。或者，他觉得自己可能会模仿旧室友，呕吐起来。

Sitting himself down on the edge of the sidewalk he waited there for Misato to pick him up and take him away to whatever place she came from. Shinji started feeling drowsy again and tried to keep himself awake, but to no avail.  
他坐在人行道边缘，等待美里来接他，带他去她来自的任何地方。真嗣又开始感到困倦，试图保持清醒，但无济于事。

It was sometime later when Shinji awoke to the sound of a car engine. It sounded like it was in agony and if it had voice Shinji knew it would be screaming. Pushing himself up into a sitting position he looked to his left where he thought he heard the sound coming from. Suddenly he saw a blue spec speeding towards him.  
过了一段时间，真嗣被汽车引擎的声音吵醒。那声音听起来像是在痛苦中挣扎，如果引擎能说话，真嗣知道它一定会尖叫。他撑起身子坐起来，朝他认为声音传来的左边看去。突然间，他看到一个蓝色的小点正飞速向他逼近。

'Shit,' he thought. 'That drivers crazy. If I don't move out of the way I'm gonna have my feet flattened into pancake.'  
“该死，”他想，“那司机疯了。如果我不躲开，我的脚就要被压成肉饼了。”

Rolling over so that he was several feet away from the curb he was suddenly glad that he had done so. The car hadn't slowed at all and only stopped when its two wheels on its right side struck the curb and ran up along it. If Shinji hadn't backed away as far as he had, he would have been pulled under the car.  
他翻滚着离开路边几英尺远，突然庆幸自己这么做了。那辆车完全没有减速，直到右侧的两个轮子撞上路边并沿着它行驶才停下来。如果真嗣没有及时后退，他就会被卷到车底下。

Shinji felt something trickling down his arm now and looked down to see that in his haste to get out of the way he had skinned his elbow. 'Wonderful,' he thought. 'Thanks to this crazy driver I'm bleeding now.'  
真嗣感觉到有什么东西顺着他的手臂流下来，低头一看，发现自己因为急于躲避而擦伤了手肘。'真倒霉，'他想，'都怪这个疯狂的司机，我现在流血了。'

Standing up slowly, he brushed the dust off his pants and shirt and now looked at his elbow. His elbow was tinged with gravel and dirt and was starting to sting a little bit. Kneeling down he reached for his bag to take a cloth out when someone grabbed his hand. He turned around slowly to see the driver of the blue car looking at him with a worried look in her eyes.  
他慢慢地站起来，拍掉裤子和衬衫上的灰尘，然后看向自己的手肘。手肘沾满了碎石和泥土，开始有点刺痛。他跪下来伸手去拿包里的布，这时有人抓住了他的手。他缓缓转过身，看到蓝色汽车的司机正用担忧的眼神看着他。

"Your not bleeding are you?"  
“你没流血吧？”

Shinji thought it would have been rude to state the obvious and make her feel ashamed and simply shrugged it off as though it was no big deal.  
真嗣认为直接指出这一点会显得很无礼，让她感到羞愧，于是他只是耸了耸肩，好像没什么大不了的。

"You are bleeding aren't you? Oh God I'm so sorry. I was just so late that I was forced to speed most of the way here, and I didn't see you and wasn't able to stop in time."  
“你流血了，对吧？哦天哪，真对不起。我太迟了，不得不一路加速赶来，没看到你，也没能及时停下来。”

She walked back to her car and opened the glove compartment and pulled out a simple first aid kit. Shinji thought this was going a bit far and opened his mouth to say so but she simply shook her head.  
她走回自己的车，打开手套箱，拿出一个简易急救包。真嗣觉得这有点过头了，正要开口说，但她只是摇了摇头。

"Its my fault that you're injured so let me do this."  
“你受伤是我的错，所以让我来处理吧。”

Shinji simply shrugged again and let her tend to his elbow. Then he felt the stinging grow stronger and had a sudden urge to yell out. He looked down and saw that she was rubbing his elbow with a small cloth that he suspected had alcohol on it. Looking away quickly so she wouldn't see the painful expression on his face. It was an odd feeling that he wasn't able to express. It almost felt like something a mother would do. Though he wasn't sure what a mother was like, since his had died when he had been young. Thoughts of his mother led to his father and he felt boiling hatred surge through him.  
真嗣只是再次耸了耸肩，任由她处理他的手肘。随后，他感到刺痛感愈发强烈，突然有种想要大叫的冲动。他低头一看，发现她正用一块小布擦拭他的手肘，他怀疑那布上沾了酒精。他迅速移开视线，以免她看到他脸上的痛苦表情。这是一种他无法表达的奇怪感觉，几乎像是母亲会做的事情。尽管他不确切知道母亲是什么样的，因为他的母亲在他年幼时就去世了。想到母亲，他不禁想起了父亲，一股沸腾的恨意涌上心头。

This stranger must have seen this and asked if he was all right. Shinji nodded and thought that he should at least thank her for what she was trying to make up for what she had done.  
这位陌生人一定察觉到了这一点，便问他是否还好。真嗣点点头，心想至少应该感谢她，因为她正试图弥补她所造成的伤害。

"Hey...um...thanks for well...helping..."  
"嘿...嗯...谢谢你...帮忙..."

"No problem," she smiled. "Its all my fault anyway so I feel responsible for cleaning it."  
"没事的，" 她微笑着说。"反正都是我的错，所以我有责任清理干净。"

"Thanks," Shinji mumbled again.  
"谢谢，" 真嗣又咕哝了一声。

The female stranger responded by putting a bandage over Shinji's scrape. Shinji now raised his elbow looked at it. It still stung a little, but at least it was clean. He could see that some blood was trying to seep through the bandage and knew he'd have to change it later.  
那位女陌生人用一个创可贴覆盖了真嗣的擦伤。真嗣抬起手肘看了看，虽然还有点刺痛，但至少干净了。他能看到有些血迹试图透过创可贴渗出来，知道稍后得更换它。

Looking over at the female driver he finally got a good look at her face. She seemed to be in her mid to late twenties. She had long purple hair that was tied back in a pony tail and on top of her head she had a pair of sun glasses. 'Way to young to be my mother,' thought Shinji. Then he looked at her chest and was surprised to see a Nerv I.D. badge pinned to her jacket which he now saw had the Nerv emblem of a leaf embedded on the shoulder.  
他转头看向那位女司机，终于看清了她的脸。她看起来二十多岁，有着一头紫色的长发，扎成马尾，头上还戴着一副太阳镜。'年纪太小了，不可能是我妈妈，'真嗣心想。然后他注意到她的胸前别着一个 NERV 的身份证章，现在他才看到她的夹克肩部嵌有 NERV 的叶子标志。

"Look I'm really sorry about what happened just now. I just..."  
“听着，我真的很抱歉刚才发生的事。我只是……”

"Don't worry so much about it. You've more than made up for what just happened." Shinji now gave her a small smile that she returned somewhat forcefully.  
"别太担心了。你已经远远弥补了刚才发生的事。" 真嗣现在给了她一个微笑，她也有些用力地回应了他。

Shinji surprised himself at the bluntness of his next question. "You don't happen to work at Nerv do you?"  
真嗣对自己接下来问题的直率感到惊讶。"你不会正好在 NERV 工作吧？"

The female driver frowned at him. "I didn't know many people knew about the existence of Nerv."  
女司机皱着眉看着他。"我没想到很多人都知道 NERV 的存在。"

"Well, the badge is in full few and you've got the emblem on your jacket. So it was a little bit obvious."  
"嗯，徽章闪闪发亮，你的夹克上也有标志。所以稍微有点明显。"

"How do you know so much? Do you know someone who works there?"  
"你怎么知道这么多？你认识那里工作的人吗？"

"Err yeah. My father does, at least, last time I talked to him he did. Though that was about a year ago."  
"呃，是的。我父亲在那儿工作，至少上次我跟他通话时是这样。虽然那已经是大约一年前的事了。"

"Your father," said the female driver now with a shocked look on her face.  
"你父亲，"女司机此刻脸上露出震惊的表情。

"I think so. Why you don't know him do you?"  
"我想是的。你怎么会不认识他呢？"

"Wait," she paused. "Your last name doesn't happen to be Ikari does it?"  
"等等，"她停顿了一下。"你的姓氏该不会是碇吧？"

"Yeah it does," said Shinji just as surprised.  
“是啊，确实如此，”真嗣同样感到惊讶地说道。

Suddenly the female driver sat down on the curb next to him and laughed out. This shocked Shinji more than anything that had happened so far that day. Her mood immediately changed from concerned to one of complete laxness. She suddenly hit him rather hard on the back, looked at him again, and laughed.  
突然，女司机坐在了他旁边的路边，放声大笑。这让真嗣比那天发生的任何事情都更加震惊。她的情绪立刻从关切转变为完全的放松。她突然重重地拍了一下他的背，再次看着他，又笑了起来。

"So I take it you know my dad?"  
“这么说，你认识我爸爸？”

"Know him. Everyone in Nerv knows who your father is. I work for him. He's the man thats in charge of Nerv. Gendo Ikari is well known for his experiments with-"  
"认识他。NERV 里的每个人都知道你父亲是谁。我为他工作。他是 NERV 的负责人。碇源堂因其与……"

She cut herself off and Shinji looked back at her rather blankly.  
她突然停了下来，真嗣茫然地回头看着她。

"Well," she said. "This makes my job a lot easier. Though I never would have thought that I'd almost run you over. I was a bit worried that you would have gotten tired of waiting for me."  
"好吧，"她说。"这让我的工作轻松多了。虽然我从没想过会差点撞到你。我还担心你会等得不耐烦呢。"

Shinji frowned at her, "You act as though you were planning to meet with...wait," and here Shinji turned to her and his eyes widened slightly. "You don't happen to be Misato Katsuragi."  
真嗣皱着眉头看着她，"你表现得好像是计划去见...等等，"说到这里，真嗣转向她，眼睛微微睁大。"你该不会就是葛城美里吧。"

She simply winked at him and said, "Bingo Shinji."  
她只是向他眨了眨眼，说："答对了，真嗣。"

Shinji was surprised but also felt happy with the change of circumstances. "So I take it that I'll be living with you for a while," he asked.  
真嗣感到惊讶，但也对情况的转变感到高兴。"那么，我是不是要和你一起住一段时间？"他问道。

"That appears to be so."  
"看来确实如此。"

Shinji suddenly felt happier than he could last remember. She didn't seem all that much like an adult now that she knew who he was but he didn't seem to care. He was just happy that he seemed to be able to talk with her easily.  
真嗣突然感到比他最近记忆中的任何时候都要快乐。她现在知道他是谁了，看起来并不那么像一个成年人，但他似乎并不介意。他只是很高兴能和她轻松地交谈。

"Well," she said standing up. "Now that I found you I suggest that we head back to my apartment and get you settled in." She looked at the bag that was sitting next to him. "I take it thats all the stuff you own."  
"好吧，"她站起身来说道，"既然我找到了你，我建议我们回我的公寓，让你安顿下来。"她看了看他旁边的包，"我想这就是你所有的东西了吧。"

Shinji looked down and nodded. It wasn't a whole lot of stuff. Most of it he had had for several years and he needed to get some new clothes. His old ones were starting to get too small.  
真嗣低头看了看，点了点头。东西并不多。大部分他已经用了好几年，需要添置些新衣服了。旧的已经开始显得太小了。

"Well, I think that I'll have to take you shopping sometime so you can get whatever you like. I take it you haven't had many choices to choose what you want."  
“嗯，我想我得找个时间带你去购物，这样你可以买到你喜欢的任何东西。我猜你之前没多少选择自己想要的东西的机会吧。”

Shinji continued to look down and mumbled a barely audible 'no.'  
真嗣继续低着头，用几乎听不见的声音咕哝了一声‘没有’。

Misato looked at him and felt a small smile appear on her face. Tapping him slightly on the shoulder she gestured for him to put his stuff in the back, which he did.  
美里看着他，脸上不由自主地露出了微笑。她轻轻拍了拍他的肩膀，示意他把东西放到后面去，他照做了。

"OK," she said. "Next stop my apartment. And I'll try not to drive too sporadically so you don't feel sick."  
“好，”她说，“下一站是我的公寓。我会尽量平稳驾驶，免得你晕车。”

At this point Shinji was just happy to have found somebody that seemed to care about him.  
此时，真嗣只是庆幸自己找到了一个似乎关心他的人。

---

Whatever Misato Katsuragi was, she was not clean. Navigating through the mess that was her apartment was almost impossible. Shinji took a small room adjacent to another room that was currently empty. He had thought about asking why he wasn't using that one, but decided it was best not to be rude. She was giving him a place to sleep after all.  
无论米萨托·卡苏拉基是什么样的人，她绝不是个整洁的人。穿越她那乱糟糟的公寓几乎是不可能的任务。真嗣住进了一个紧邻另一间空房间的小房间。他本想问为什么不让他住那间，但觉得还是不要失礼为好。毕竟，她给了他一个睡觉的地方。

One thing that he hadn't been expecting about her was the fact that she drank a lot of beer. Upon opening the fridge to get something to drink, he saw more six packs of beer than what had been at his old roommates place. Shinji wasn't sure whether to laugh, or feel annoyed and simply closed it and got water out of the tap.  
有一件事他没料到，那就是她喝很多啤酒。打开冰箱想找点喝的，他发现啤酒六包装的数量比他以前的室友那儿还多。真嗣不确定是该笑，还是感到恼火，最后他只是关上冰箱，从水龙头接了水喝。

Misato had to go back to work almost immediately when they had gotten back and said that she wouldn't be back until later in the afternoon. She said that she would tell his father that she had picked him up, and that now he was now living in her apartment. Shinji was guessing that his father didn't care. As long as he wasn't bothering him at all.  
米萨托几乎一回来就得立刻回去工作，她说下午晚些时候才能回来。她告诉他，她会通知他父亲已经把他接来了，现在他住在她的公寓里。真嗣猜想他父亲并不在乎。只要他不打扰他就行。

Shinji had gotten tired of the bottles of beer and bags of junk food littering the floor and decided to do clean the apartment. From what he saw, she mainly ate take out or instant meals.  
真嗣对满地的啤酒瓶和垃圾食品袋感到厌倦，决定打扫一下公寓。从他看到的来看，她主要吃外卖或速食。

'Well, good thing I taught myself how to cook these past years,' thought Shinji.  
'还好这几年我自学了烹饪，'真嗣心想。

Finished with the cleaning, he proceeded to take a shower but opened the wrong door and found himself face to face with a penguin. Shinji let out a loud yell that could be heard several floors down as he backed up to the fridge reaching for a blunt object. The penguin simply looked back at him blinking at him sleepily. Yawning widely the penguin grasped a hold of the sliding door and closed it once again, but not before giving a loud squawk in Shinji's direction  
打扫完毕后，他去洗澡，却误开了另一扇门，迎面撞见一只企鹅。真嗣惊声尖叫，声音响彻几层楼，他后退到冰箱旁，伸手去拿钝器。企鹅只是睡眼惺忪地眨眼看着他。打了个大大的哈欠，企鹅抓住推拉门再次关上，临走前还朝真嗣的方向发出一声响亮的鸣叫。

Shinji's heart was beating faster than he could last remember. 'What the hell is that woman thinking. Keeping a penguin in an environment like this.' Now though he wondered if the penguin had some bit of intelligence in it and decided to ask her later.  
真嗣的心跳比他记忆中任何时候都要快。'那个女人到底在想什么。在这种环境下养企鹅。' 不过现在他好奇那只企鹅是否有些许智慧，决定稍后再问她。

Sighing slightly he walked to the correct bathroom this time, stripped quickly, and was pleased to feel the hot water hitting his skin. For no apparent reason, his thoughts strayed to last night when he had seen that girl down by the shore against the setting sun. If he knew that things would have happened like this and he would be staying in Tokyo-3, then he would have asked her name at least. Though now it seemed that he wouldn't see her again. "Wonder what she's like..." He wondered out loud.  
他轻叹一声，这次走向了正确的浴室，迅速脱掉衣服，感受着热水洒在皮肤上的舒适。不知为何，他的思绪飘到了昨晚，他在海边看到那个女孩，夕阳映衬着她的身影。如果他早知道事情会变成这样，他会留在第三新东京市，至少会问她的名字。但现在看来，他可能再也见不到她了。“不知道她是什么样的人...”他自言自语道。

Suddenly he hit his head against the wall of the shower. Certain thoughts had just crossed his mind and he didn't quite appreciate them. He didn't even know who she was. Hadn't even seen her face for that matter. 'Stop thinking like that you idiot. The chances of seeing her again are almost nil.'  
突然间，他的头撞到了淋浴间的墙上。某些念头刚刚闪过他的脑海，他并不喜欢这些想法。他甚至不知道她是谁，连她的脸都没看清。'别再这么想了，你这个傻瓜。再见到她的可能性几乎为零。'

Turning off the hot water before anything else crossed his mind, he wrapped a towel around his waist and walked to his bedroom to change.  
他首先关掉了热水，然后围上一条毛巾，走向卧室换衣服。

Misato didn't come home until late at night. Shinji had fallen asleep in his new room with his SDAT waiting for her to come home. He awoke when he heard her stumbling around the kitchen and slid his door open a little to see her looking in the fridge for something.  
美里直到深夜才回家。真嗣在他的新房间里睡着了，SDAT 播放器还在等着她回来。听到她在厨房里跌跌撞撞的声音，他醒了过来，轻轻拉开房门，看到她在冰箱里找东西。

"Misato-san, you're home later than you said you would be."  
“美里小姐，你回来得比说的要晚呢。”

"Oh sorry Shinji. I had some things I had to take care of. Thanks for cleaning up around her. I've been meaning to, but I just don't have enough time."  
“哦，抱歉，真嗣。我有些事情需要处理。谢谢你帮她打扫。我一直想做，但就是没时间。”

Shinji highly doubted that she would have cleaned, even if she had a week of nothing to do, but he didn't care. It kept him occupied at least when he had nothing to do.  
真嗣高度怀疑即使她有一周的空闲时间，她也不会打扫，但他并不在意。至少在他无所事事时，这让他有事可做。

Sitting down in a chair next to her, he frowned when he saw that she had a can of beer in her hand. Even though Shinji was only fifteen he knew that drinking before bed wasn't the smartest thing to do, and opened his mouth to say something when she cut across him.  
他坐在她旁边的椅子上，看到她手里拿着一罐啤酒时皱起了眉头。尽管真嗣只有十五岁，但他知道睡前喝酒不是明智之举，正要开口说些什么时，她打断了他。

"I talked to your father and he wanted me to tell you something."  
"我和你父亲谈过了，他有些话让我转告你。"

Shinji wasn't it the mood to listen to anything that his father felt worthwhile but simply nodded.  
真嗣此刻并无心情听父亲认为有价值的事，只是简单地点了点头。

"He wants you to continue going to the school your currently attending."  
"他希望你继续在目前就读的学校学习。"

Shinji was surprised at this. "Does he want to keep me here for a while or something?"  
真嗣对此感到惊讶。“他是想让我在这里待一段时间吗？”

"Can't say," said Misato taking a huge gulp of beer.  
“不好说，”美里说着，猛灌了一大口啤酒。

"I met that penguin of yours but the way," said Shinji.  
“我顺便见到了你的那只企鹅，”真嗣说道。

Misato raised an eyebrow at him and put her beer down. "Forgot that I hadn't shown Pen-Pen to you yet. He didn't attack you or anything did he?"  
美里对他挑了挑眉，放下手中的啤酒。“忘了我还没带你见过 Pen-Pen 呢。他没攻击你吧？”

"No. Seemed like I woke him up though, but he just went back to sleep."  
“没有。不过我好像把他吵醒了，但他只是又睡回去了。”

"Just like him." She finished her beer and belched rather unladylike. She was a lot different than what he had expected.  
“他就这样。”她喝完啤酒，打了个相当不淑女的嗝。她和他的预期大相径庭。

"I'm going to bed now. I expect you to go to school like a good boy tomorrow. Make sure you do go, or you'll have to answer to me."  
"我现在要去睡觉了。我希望你明天能像个乖孩子一样去上学。一定要去，否则你得向我解释。"

Shinji chuckled, "You sound like a mother."  
真嗣轻笑道：“你听起来像个妈妈。”

"I'm now your guardian so its only natural that I look after you."  
"我现在是你的监护人，所以照顾你是理所当然的。"

Shinji blinked and felt tears forming in his eyes and hastily wiped them away with the back of his hand.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，感觉泪水在眼眶中形成，急忙用手背擦去。

"Well, I'll see you tomorrow Shinji, good night."  
“那么，明天见，真嗣，晚安。”

"Yeah, good night Misato."  
“嗯，晚安，美里。”

---

When Shinji arrived at school the next day whispers followed him wherever he went. Apparently most of the kids had thought he had finally dropped out. They were therefore surprised to see him there the next day. True to his word Shinji, didn't even bring his SDAT so that it wouldn't distract him. Now that he had a place that he could happily call home he felt like putting more of an effort into his school work, even if the other kids didn't believe him.  
第二天，当真嗣踏入学校时，耳边传来的窃窃私语如影随形。显然，大多数孩子都以为他终于退学了。因此，看到他第二天出现在学校，他们都感到惊讶。正如他承诺的那样，真嗣甚至没有带上他的 SDAT，以免分心。现在他有了一个可以称之为家的温馨之地，他觉得自己应该更加努力学习，即使其他孩子不相信他。

His teacher still didn't think that he was trying seriously though, and ignored him for most of the day. The morning passed without much of a difference in what Shinji was normally used to, and he was just thinking of going home when there teacher addressed them.  
尽管如此，他的老师仍然认为他没有认真对待学习，大部分时间都忽视了他。上午的时光与真嗣平常所经历的并无太大差别，正当他想着回家时，老师向他们讲话了。

"We have a new student that will be joining us today. She is an exchange student from Germany and she can speak Japanese fluently. She has also graduated from a German university at the age of fourteen and is extremely brilliant."  
“我们今天有一位新同学加入。她是从德国来的交换生，日语说得非常流利。她在十四岁时就从德国的一所大学毕业，极其聪明。”

He looked up from the piece of paper that he was reading from and looking towards the door. "Is that it then?" he asked with a slight annoyed tone in his voice?  
他从正在阅读的纸张上抬起头，望向门口。“就这样了吗？”他带着一丝不悦的语气问道？

"Yeah, thats enough," said an energetic voice from the other side of the door leading out into the hallway.  
“是的，够了，”门外走廊传来一个充满活力的声音。

Shinji was starring out the window and was only picking up about half of this. 'Just another annoying girl like the rest of them,' he thought.  
真嗣正望着窗外，只听进了一半的内容。'不过是又一个像其他女孩一样烦人的家伙，'他心想。

Again there teacher starting talking but the girl had cut across him now. "I can introduce myself," she said.  
老师再次开始讲话，但女孩此刻打断了他。“我可以自我介绍，”她说。

Even though Shinji wasn't paying attention to what was going on he could tell that a change in the room had happened. All the guys around him had started whispering all at once and Shinji could only assume that it had something to do with the new girl.  
尽管真嗣没有注意周围发生的事情，但他能感觉到房间里发生了变化。他周围的男生们突然同时开始窃窃私语，真嗣只能猜测这与新来的女孩有关。

The girl had started talking again either oblivious to the muttering of the guys or simply enjoying it.  
女孩又开始说话了，无论是对男生们的低语浑然不觉，还是单纯地享受着这种氛围。

Shinji heard the light tapping of chalk against the board and now heard her start talking again though this time he was paying attention enough to at least get her name.  
真嗣听到粉笔轻敲黑板的声音，现在又听到她开始讲话了，这次他至少注意到了她的名字。

"My name is Asuka Langely Soryu. Pleasure to meet all of you."  
“我叫惣流·明日香·兰格雷。很高兴见到大家。”

All at once their was a massive babbling from all the guys except Shinji who was once again ignoring the whole thing. Asuka had questions launched at her from all over the place and she couldn't help but smirk as all the guys fawned over her.  
一瞬间，除了真嗣外，所有男生都开始七嘴八舌起来。明日香被四面八方的问题轰炸，忍不住对那些围着她献殷勤的男生们露出得意的笑容。

It took sometime for there teacher to get everyone quieted down. When he had yelled at several guys who had tried to get her phone number and threatened several others to send them to the principles office, he told Asuka to take the empty seat in front of Shinji.  
花了些时间，老师才让所有人安静下来。他对着几个试图要她电话号码的男生大吼，又威胁要把其他几个人送到校长办公室，然后让 Asuka 坐在 Shinji 前面的空位上。

Shinji only caught this last part and sighed slightly. From the sound of this girl, she thought that she was superior to everyone else. He would have preferred to just continue looking out the window, but saw that somebody was standing over him.  
Shinji 只听到了最后这部分，微微叹了口气。从这女孩的语气来看，她自认为高人一等。他本想继续望着窗外，却注意到有人站在他面前。

Looking away from the window he came face to face with Asuka, who was starring back at him. The entire classroom had gone quiet and Shinji felt his heart stop as soon as he looked into her face.  
他转过视线，不再看向窗外，迎面遇上了 Asuka 的目光，她正盯着他。整个教室都安静了下来，Shinji 一看到她的脸，心跳仿佛都停止了。

'No way,' he thought. 'She can't be, but...no its gotta be her.'  
“不可能，”他心想，“她不可能是，但……不，肯定是她。”

He was looking up into the face of the girl he had seen on the beach. Her hair was the correct color and Shinji confirmed that it was her when he saw the hair clips that she had in her hair. His eyes strayed to her face and saw that she had blue eyes which seemed to be rather stern. He couldn't believe that he was looking into the face of her, and that he also knew her name now. What's more she was looking at him rather intently and curiously. 'This is awkward,' thought Shinji as beads of sweat formed on his forehead.  
他抬头看着那个在海滩上见过的女孩的脸。她的发色完全吻合，当看到她头发上的发夹时，真嗣确认了就是她。他的目光移到她的脸上，发现她有着相当严肃的蓝色眼睛。他不敢相信自己正凝视着她的脸，而且现在还知道了她的名字。更甚的是，她正相当专注且好奇地看着他。“这真尴尬，”真嗣想着，额头上冒出了汗珠。

Suddenly she put her hand out and flicked her forefinger against his forehead making him flinch slightly. Shinji wasn't sure what to make of this behavior. Was she teasing him, or what?  
突然，她伸出手，用食指弹了一下他的额头，让他微微一缩。真嗣不确定她这是什么意思。是在逗他吗，还是别的什么？

Suddenly their teacher cleared his throat slightly and Asuka turned around to frown at him. Shinji's eyes strayed over her again taking her in. Shinji felt that if he continued to stare at her, he would start having strange thoughts again, and quickly turned his gaze back to the window. Asuka saw this and now there was a very annoyed look on her face. She turned her back on him and sat down in front of him.  
突然，他们的老师轻轻清了清喉咙，明日香转过身来皱眉看着他。真嗣的目光再次掠过她，细细打量。真嗣觉得如果继续盯着她看，他又会开始产生奇怪的想法，于是迅速将视线转回窗外。明日香看到这一幕，脸上露出了非常不悦的表情。她转过身背对着他，坐在他前面。

Shinji could hear the muttering of the fellow males in his classroom all discussing what had just happened between the two. "Why does he get to sit behind her?"  
真嗣能听到教室里其他男生在窃窃私语，讨论着刚才两人之间发生的事情。"为什么他能坐在她后面？"

"And why did she flick his forehead? Do they know each other from somewhere?"  
“还有，她为什么弹他的额头？他们是不是在哪儿认识？”

Shinji was getting annoyed at this, and saw that in front of him Asuka was steadily turning red.  
这让真嗣感到恼火，他看到前方的明日香正逐渐涨红了脸。

However the teacher started to call out roll and brought the class back order.  
然而，老师开始点名，将课堂秩序恢复了。

Asuka meanwhile was thinking about what had just happened. When she had walked into the class every single guy was drooling over her, though that one behind her hadn't even flinched when she walked in. Either he was gay, retarded, or had no emotions of which she thought the last one was mostly true. She had attempted to get a reaction out of him by flirting with him a little, just to tease him, but he didn't even respond. 'How pathetic,' she thought. She couldn't stand weak guys.  
与此同时，明日香正在思考刚刚发生的事情。当她走进教室时，每个男生都对她垂涎三尺，唯独她身后的那个家伙在她进来时连眼皮都没动一下。要么他是同性恋，要么是智力障碍，要么就是毫无情感，她认为最后一种可能性最大。她试图通过稍微调情来激起他的反应，只是为了逗逗他，但他甚至没有任何回应。'真是可悲，'她想。她无法忍受软弱的男人。

Meanwhile the teacher had continued to call out names and Asuka answered when she heard hers called. When the teacher asked if Ayanami Rei was still absent Asuka smirked, 'So the precious First Child goes to this school as well. What a fun experience that will be, trying to have a conversation with the doll. She's even more lifeless than the guy behind me.'  
与此同时，老师继续点名，听到自己的名字时，明日香应了一声。当老师询问绫波零是否仍缺席时，明日香轻蔑一笑，'原来那个珍贵的第一适格者也在这所学校啊。跟那个娃娃交流一定很有趣，她比坐在我后面的家伙还要死气沉沉。'

The teacher went through the list of names and Shinji was starting to wonder if his name was even still on their when the teacher called out his name rather reluctantly.  
老师逐一念出名单上的名字，真嗣开始怀疑自己的名字是否还在上面，这时老师颇为勉强地叫出了他的名字。

"And Shinji Ikari. You're still here aren't you?" It was as if the teacher wished he wasn't.  
“还有碇真嗣，你还在这里吧？”仿佛老师希望他不在似的。

"Yeah," replied Shinji. 'Though I sure as hell don't want to be,' he thought.  
“嗯，”真嗣回答道。'虽然我绝对不想这样，'他心想。

Asuka however had spun around in her chair when she heard Shinji's last name, and frowned at him.  
然而，听到真嗣的姓氏后，明日香在椅子上转过身来，皱着眉头看向他。

Shinji noticed this but continued to stare out the window. 'God what is wrong with her? As far as I know she has no reason to hate me at all. Or is she just normally annoyed at everyone?'  
真嗣注意到了这一点，但继续凝视着窗外。'上帝啊，她怎么了？据我所知，她没有任何理由恨我。还是她对每个人都这样烦躁？'

Asuka had heard that Shinji's last name was Ikari but was still surprised to hear it. 'So your the son of Gendo Ikari who's in charge of Nerv, huh. I guess going to this school wasn't a complete waste of my time.'  
明日香曾听说真嗣的姓氏是碇，但亲耳听到还是感到惊讶。'原来你是那个负责 NERV 的碇源堂的儿子啊。看来来这所学校也不完全是浪费我的时间。'

Turning around, Asuka faced the front of the room, ignoring Shinji for the rest of the class period.  
明日香转过身，面向教室前方，整个课间再也没有理会真嗣。

Shinji however couldn't help but have his eyes stray towards her occasionally. She was really quite beautiful, even if her attitude was a little rough. Shinji was really starting to wish that he had just asked her name yesterday. If he had, maybe things wouldn't have gotten off to such a rough start.  
然而，真嗣忍不住时不时将目光投向她。她真的很美，尽管态度有些粗鲁。真嗣开始后悔昨天没有问她的名字。如果当时问了，也许事情就不会一开始就那么糟糕。

---

After school Shinji slowly walked back towards Misato's apartment. He figured that she would be wanting to hear about what he did in school today. 'She can be a bit annoying at times,' he thought. But then she was the best roommate that he had, so he wasn't complaining.  
放学后，真嗣缓缓走向美里小姐的公寓。他猜想她会想听听他今天在学校做了些什么。'她有时确实有点烦人，'他想。但她是他最好的室友，所以他并不抱怨。

As Shinji walked he couldn't help but notice that Asuka was walking on the sidewalk opposite of where he was. It seemed that the two of them where heading in the same direction and Shinji felt slightly nervous, remembering that their paths would cross at the next intersection.  
真嗣走着走着，忍不住注意到明日香在他对面的便道上走着。看起来他们俩正朝着同一个方向前进，真嗣感到有些紧张，记得他们的路线会在下一个路口交汇。

As she crossed the sidewalk to get on his side, he hurriedly sped up so that he could be in front of her. He was nervous now about talking to her, considering she seemed to dislike him. Shinji really didn't want to talk with her right now, and constantly looked over his shoulder to check that she was still a good distance away. Call him a coward if you will, but the last thing he wanted was to get on this girls bad side. Surprisingly though, he heard her calling out to him.  
当她穿过便道来到他这边时，他急忙加快脚步，以便能走在她前面。他现在对和她说话感到紧张，考虑到她似乎不喜欢他。真嗣真的不想现在和她说话，并不时回头确认她还在一段距离之外。如果你愿意，可以称他为懦夫，但他最不想的就是惹恼这个女孩。然而，出乎意料的是，他听到她在叫他。

"Oi, you, from this morning. Slow down a minute, I want to talk to you."  
“喂，你，今早的那个。慢点儿，我有话跟你说。”

Shinji did his best to ignore her, and kept walking forward, but his pace quickened slightly. He heard hurried footsteps behind him however, and soon, Asuka was matching her pace with his, several feet behind him. Ignoring her he continued to walk at a steady pace.  
真嗣尽力忽视她，继续向前走，但脚步稍稍加快了些。然而，他听到身后急促的脚步声，不久，明日香便与他保持了几步之遥，步伐一致。他继续稳稳地走着，对她视而不见。

'My god,' she thought in German. 'What does it take to get a reaction from this idiot?'  
“我的天，”她用德语想，“要怎样才能让这个白痴有点反应？”

She continued walking directly behind him, but changed pace again, so that she was walking at the same pace next to him. Shinji couldn't help it, and glanced over at her. Asuka was looking over at him. Her lips were smiling, but there was something malicious in her eyes that Shinji didn't care for.  
她继续直接跟在他身后走着，但又改变了步伐，以便与他并肩而行。真嗣忍不住瞥了她一眼。明日香正看着他。她的嘴角带着笑意，但眼中却闪烁着真嗣不喜欢的恶意。

'Does she expect me to say something? Or should I be acting like all the other guys in my classroom did?'  
'她是不是期待我说些什么？还是我应该像班上其他男生那样表现？'

Asuka didn't try say anything to him though, and after walking alongside him for a while in silence, Shinji heard her mumble something inaudible under her breath, and then she sped up past him, throwing him a rather vicious glance as she did.  
然而，明日香并没有试图对他说什么，在沉默中与他并肩走了一会儿后，真嗣听到她低声咕哝了一句听不清的话，然后她加快脚步超过了他，经过时还狠狠地瞪了他一眼。

Shinji slowed down, and then stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, looking up at the sky. 'Wonderful,' he thought. 'I get a cool roommate who acts like my guardian, but now I've met the strangest girl ever. Great way to start my new life out.'  
真嗣放慢了脚步，然后在人行道中央停了下来，抬头望向天空。'真是奇妙，'他心想，'我有了一个酷似监护人的室友，但现在又遇到了有史以来最奇怪的女孩。开启新生活的绝佳方式啊。'

Sighing slightly, he returned his eyes to the sidewalk, and continued walking. He was rather eager to get back to Misato's apartment, his new home, but he wished that Asuka would just go back to Germany.  
他轻轻叹了口气，将目光转回人行道上，继续前行。他相当渴望回到美里小姐的公寓，他的新家，但他希望明日香能直接回德国去。

---

"Misato I'm back," Shinji called as he took off his shoes and stepped into the apartment.  
“美里小姐，我回来了，”真嗣一边喊着，一边脱下鞋子走进了公寓。

"Ah good I was just getting worried. You took longer than I expected."  
"啊，太好了，我正担心呢。你比我想象中花的时间要长。"

"Well, some things happened," said Shinji as he walked into the kitchen and stopped dead when he saw that Misato was drinking tea with someone.  
"嗯，发生了一些事情，" 真嗣说着走进厨房，却在看到美里正和某人喝茶时愣住了。

Asuka was sitting at the kitchen table with Misato holding a tea cup in her hand which immediately fell to the floor, shattering, sending tea in all directions.  
明日香坐在厨房的桌子旁，手里拿着茶杯，茶杯立刻掉到地上，碎裂开来，茶水四溅。

Shinji blinked blankly back and suddenly realized what she was wearing. She was dressed in a loose tang-top which fell loosely around her chest revealing a little more then Shinji cared to comment on. She had apparently abandoned the need to even bother with pants and was in nothing more than her underwear, which were also white. What's more she had removed the hair clips and now her hair was meshed together in one long wave.  
真嗣茫然地眨了眨眼，随即突然意识到她穿的是什么。她身着一件宽松的唐装上衣，松松垮垮地垂在胸前，露出了比真嗣愿意评论的还要多的部分。她显然已经放弃了穿裤子的念头，只穿着内衣，同样也是白色的。更甚的是，她摘掉了发夹，现在她的头发如同一道长长的波浪般披散着。

Asuka stared blankly back at him for several seconds before shouting, "WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?"  
明日香茫然地盯着他看了几秒钟，然后大喊道：“这他妈是什么鬼？”

She ran at him and grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him ferociously. Thankfully Misato stepped in between them before she was able to cause him any more bodily harm.  
她向他冲去，抓住他的肩膀猛烈摇晃。幸好美里及时介入，阻止了她进一步对他造成身体伤害。

"Asuka calm down," said Misato as she dragged her away from Shinji.  
“Asuka，冷静点，”Misato 边说边把她从 Shinji 身边拉开。

"Why is he here!?" “他为什么在这里！？”

Misato simply laughed. "I see that the two of you know each other from somewhere."  
Misato 只是笑了笑。“看来你们俩之前在哪儿见过面。”

Shinji now spoke up and said, "Unfortunately yes."  
真嗣这时开口说道：“不幸的是，确实如此。”

"What was?" yelled Asuka.  
“什么确实如此？”明日香大声问道。

"Now come on you two," said Misato. "You guys are both going to be living here, so I expect you to be able to get along."  
“好啦，你们两个，”美里说，“你们俩以后都要住在这里，所以我希望你们能和睦相处。”

They both stared blankly back at her.  
他们俩都茫然地回望着她。

"Come again?" asked Asuka. "I don't think I heard you correctly?"  
"再说一遍？" 明日香问道，"我觉得我没听清楚？"

"You. Two. Will. Be. Living. Together. Here," repeated Misato.  
"你们两个。将要。一起。住在这里，" 美里重复道。

Asuka looked blankly back at her and then turned around and walked out of the kitchen.  
明日香茫然地回头看了她一眼，然后转身走出了厨房。

"Asuka where are you going?" asked Misato as Asuka gathered up her things.  
“明日香，你要去哪儿？”美里问道，而明日香正在收拾自己的东西。

"I'm leaving. No way in hell can I live in the same apartment with this moron."  
“我要走了。我绝不可能和这个白痴住在同一个公寓里。”

With that she slammed the door and left the apartment.  
说完，她砰地一声关上门，离开了公寓。

Shinji was left standing alone in the kitchen as the whole thing hit him. 'Oh God. Me and Asuka living together? I wouldn't survive a day.' However when Misato came back in, she told him that Asuka had left without any intention of coming back.  
真嗣独自站在厨房里，这一切突然击中了他。'哦，天哪。我和明日香住在一起？我一天都撑不过去。'然而，当美里回来时，她告诉他明日香已经离开，没有回来的打算。

"What the hell happened between the two of you?" asked Misato.  
“你们俩之间到底发生了什么？”美里问道。

"...I'm not even sure," was all Shinji said, before he launched into the school day and what happened afterwards.  
“……我也不确定，”真嗣只说了这么一句，便开始讲述起学校里发生的事以及之后的经过。

---

By the time he had finished several hours had gone by and she could hear the steady plop plop as it started to rain outside.  
当他讲完时，几个小时已经过去了，她能听到外面开始下雨，传来一阵阵稳定的滴答声。

Misato looked out the window. She was starting to get worried about Asuka. She had left in nothing but that tang-top and underwear and was worried that she would be getting cold by now.  
美里望向窗外。她开始担心明日香了。明日香只穿着那件吊带衫和内衣就出去了，她担心她现在可能已经感到冷了。

Walking into the living room she saw that Shinji was contently sitting on the couch listening to his SDAT and reading a book. 'Does he really not care about here? Its not like she's the most unattractive girl out there.' Then she suddenly winced at the prospect of someone taking advantage of her with it raining like this.  
走进客厅，她看到真嗣正惬意地坐在沙发上，听着他的 SDAT，读着一本书。'他真的不在乎这里吗？她又不像是最不吸引人的女孩。'随后她突然因想到在这样的雨天有人可能会利用她而皱起了眉头。

"Shinji get up," she said pushing against his arm rather forcibly.  
“真嗣，起来，”她相当用力地推了推他的手臂说道。

"Huh...Oh Misato, what do you want?"  
“嗯...哦，美里，你想要什么？”

"What I want is for you to go out and find Asuka."  
"我想要的是你去找到明日香。"

Shinji frowned, "Why? You heard her, she doesn't want to be in the same room with me."  
真嗣皱眉，"为什么？你听到了，她不想和我待在同一个房间里。"

"So are you saying you aren't worried about her at all?"  
"那么你是说你一点都不担心她吗？"

"I..." he hesitated. "She can taking of herself," he said finally.  
"我..." 他犹豫了一下。"她能照顾好自己，" 他最终说道。

"Look its raining out and she's left in clothes that aren't even suitable for the summer."  
"看，外面在下雨，她却穿着连夏天都不合适的衣服。"

"Thats her problem not mine."  
"那是她的问题，不是我的。"

This earned him a slap. Putting his hand up to his face, he felt the spot that stung slightly from where Misato's hand had struck him. Looking up, he saw that she was glaring at him with something close to hatred.  
这让他挨了一巴掌。他抬起手摸向脸颊，感觉到被美里手掌击中的地方微微刺痛。抬头一看，只见她正用近乎憎恨的目光瞪着他。

"Are you that insensitive, Shinji? Do you seriously not care what could happen to her? She's out there in the freezing rain, possibly being picked up by some guy in a truck with who knows what happening to her. And you say that it's her problem not yours. She's right you don't have emotions. You're a coward."  
“你就这么迟钝吗，真嗣？你真的不在乎她可能遭遇什么吗？她在外面冰冷的雨中，可能被某个开着卡车的家伙带走，谁知道会发生什么。而你却说那是她的问题，不是你的。她说的没错，你没有感情。你是个懦夫。”

He looked back at her and suddenly felt ashamed of himself for thinking like that. She was right he was emotionless and a coward.  
他回望向她，突然为自己那样想感到羞愧。她说得对，他是个没有感情的懦夫。

Sitting bolt upright now he flung himself off the couch and ran to his room tossing on a pair of jeans a long sleeve shirt and a jacket. He was about to leave the room when he decided that he better bring a spare for Asuka.  
他猛地坐直身子，从沙发上跳下来，冲进自己的房间，迅速套上一条牛仔裤、一件长袖衬衫和一件夹克。正要离开房间时，他决定最好给明日香带件备用的。

He ran out of his room and found himself face to face with Misato.  
他跑出房间，迎面撞上了美里。

"I...I-I'm sorry for being such an insensitive jerk. I'll be sure to find her and bring her back."  
“我……我……我很抱歉，我真是个不体贴的混蛋。我一定会找到她，把她带回来。”

With that he ran out the door into the downpour.  
说完，他便冲出门外，投身于倾盆大雨之中。

Misato smiled slightly at him now, "Hmph he just doesn't want to let on to his emotions."  
美里此刻对他微微一笑，"哼，他就是不想表露自己的情感。"

---

Shinji ran through Tokyo-3, thinking of all the possibilities where Asuka could have gone. It had been at least three hours since she left and forty-five minutes since this downpour had started. 'She must have found shelter somewhere,' he thought and decided to check around some of the slums that littered Tokyo-3. Though he hoped that she had stayed out of those. Even though he had only known her for a short while, and he couldn't say he liked her, he was feeling worried for her sake.  
真嗣在第三新东京市中奔跑，脑海里不断闪现着明日香可能去的地方。她离开至少已有三个小时，而这场大雨也已持续了四十五分钟。'她一定在某处找到了避雨的地方，'他想，并决定去检查一下遍布第三新东京市的贫民窟。尽管他希望她没有涉足那些地方。虽然他认识她不久，也谈不上喜欢她，但他还是为她感到担忧。

Soon Shinji found himself going door to door to peoples houses asking if they had seen a girl around age fifteen or sixteen with long red hair and blue eyes. He didn't feel like mentioning what she was wearing. None of them where able to provide any answer and Shinji eventually decided that she wasn't in this part of Tokyo-3.  
不久，真嗣发现自己挨家挨户地敲门，询问是否有人见过一个大约十五六岁、长着红色长发和蓝色眼睛的女孩。他觉得没必要提及她的穿着。没有人能提供任何线索，真嗣最终断定她不在这片东京-3 的区域。

His mind was starting to scream out at him for letting things escalate to this point. 'AH IF ONLY I HAD JUST ASKED HER NAME YESTERDAY THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED.' Suddenly he remembered the beach yesterday.  
他的内心开始尖叫，责怪自己让事情发展到这个地步。'啊，如果昨天我直接问她的名字，也许就不会发生这种事了。'突然，他想起了昨天的海滩。

'Yes,' he told himself. 'Thats got to be where she is.'  
'没错，'他对自己说，'她一定在那里。'

Running faster than he could remember, with the spare jacket flopping along his shoulders, he managed to get to the beach within the span of minutes. Looking down he couldn't see much, owing to the fact that a mist had settled on the beach. He quickly ran down the steps leading to the beach, and started calling out her name frantically.  
他跑得比记忆中任何时候都快，备用夹克在肩上拍打着，几分钟内就赶到了海滩。低头一看，由于雾气笼罩，几乎看不清什么。他迅速跑下通往海滩的台阶，开始疯狂地呼喊她的名字。

'Damn it, she better be here,' he thought.  
“该死，她最好在这里，”他心想。

This mist was so hard to see, that several times had tripped over wooden logs that had been washed up onto the beach. Suddenly, he tripped over something that was rather large and heavy. Falling to the ground he reached over and felt that it was a bag of some sort. 'Asuka's bag?'  
这雾气如此浓重，以至于好几次他都被冲上沙滩的木头绊倒。突然，他被一个又大又重的东西绊倒了。摔倒在地，他伸手一摸，发现那是一个包。“明日香的包？”

Suddenly he yelled out, "Asuka where are you!?"  
突然，他大喊道：“明日香，你在哪儿！？”

At first, all he could hear was his own voice returning to him on the wind, but then he thought he heard a reply from somewhere off to his right. Scooping up her bag, he ran in the direction of the voice only to trip over something much more squishy and heard a small yelp of surprise. He realized that he had fallen on top of her but didn't care about the position when he heard her voice.  
起初，他只能听到自己的声音随风回荡，但随后他似乎听到右边某个地方传来了回应。他抓起她的包，朝着声音的方向跑去，却不料绊倒在一个软绵绵的东西上，听到了一声小小的惊呼。他意识到自己压在了她身上，但听到她的声音时，他并不在乎这个姿势。

"Idiot, what are you doing out here in the freezing cold."  
“笨蛋，这么冷的天你在外面干什么。”

The mist cleared and he saw that he was a few inches away from her face.  
雾气散去，他发现自己离她的脸只有几英寸远。

"...Asuka," he said weakly.  
"...明日香," 他虚弱地说道。

She frowned up at him, and sighed. "How long do you plan on lying on top of me."  
她皱着眉头看向他，叹了口气。"你打算在我身上躺多久？"

"Ah, no...this is," muttered Shinji.  
“啊，不……这是，”真嗣喃喃道。

He pushed himself off of her, and saw that she had gotten up also. His face opened up into his first blush as he saw that the rain had made her tang-top see through. It clung to her body like a fly clung to fly paper and Shinji had to tear his gaze away from her.  
他推开她，发现她也站了起来。看到雨水让她的短上衣变得透明，紧贴在身上如同苍蝇粘在苍蝇纸上，真嗣的脸颊泛起了第一抹红晕，不得不移开视线。

"So what do you want?" she asked with a scowl.  
“那你想要什么？”她皱着眉问道。

Shinji looked back at her rather surprised. "Why do you think I'm out here in the freezing rain? It certainly isn't to go for a jog."  
真嗣回头看着她，显得有些惊讶。“你觉得我为什么会在这种冰冷的雨中？当然不是为了去跑步。”

"Real witty," she smirked.  
“真机智，”她微微一笑。

"I was worried about you."  
“我担心你。”

Asuka had to let that flow through her mind before it registered.  
明日香不得不让这些思绪在脑海中流淌，然后才逐渐理解。

"You where worried about me?" she whispered.  
“你担心我？”她低声问道。

"Of course. You just left without a word. Then this storm started up, and you...well weren't wearing much so...and also I well...I mean...your not the most err unattractive girl so...I was a bit well...worried about your well being. What with how you looked and...some guys might have wanted to take advantage of that."  
“当然。你一声不吭就走了。然后这场风暴开始了，而你……嗯，穿得不多，所以……而且我也……我的意思是……你不是那种……呃，不吸引人的女孩，所以……我有点……担心你的安危。考虑到你的样子和……有些家伙可能会想占你便宜。”

Asuka was amazed at what he was referring to.  
明日香对他所指的事情感到惊讶。

"You were scared that I might have been raped?" she whispered.  
“你担心我可能被强奸了？”她低声问道。

"Yeah," he mumbled. “嗯，”他含糊地应道。

She was touched by his chivalrousness but didn't want to admit it.  
她被他的骑士精神所感动，但不想承认这一点。

"Idiot, I can take care of myself." Frowning at him, she continued with, "Thanks though, I guess...or...well...yeah"  
"傻瓜，我自己能照顾好自己。" 她皱着眉头对他说，接着又补充道，"不过，还是谢谢了，我想...或者...嗯...好吧"

It was a little awkward for the two of them. Barely three hours ago they had been looking daggers at each other. Shinji took this moment to hand her her bag and also give her the spare coat.  
对他们两人来说，这有点尴尬。仅仅三个小时前，他们还彼此怒目而视。真嗣趁这个机会递给她她的包，还把备用外套给了她。

She looked at him, surprised at the thoughtfulness of this and took it without question. Though when she put it on she started shivering worse than ever.  
她惊讶于他的体贴，毫不犹豫地接过那件衣物。然而，当她穿上后，却开始比之前颤抖得更厉害。

"Is something wrong," he asked?  
“有什么不对劲吗？”他问道。

"Of course idiot, this thing is soaking wet. I felt better without it."  
“当然，傻瓜，这东西湿透了。不穿还好些。”

"Well, then take mine. It's warmer."  
"那好吧，用我的。我的更暖和。"

"With your body touching it, not a chance."  
"你那身体贴着它，别想了。"

"Oh just deal with it Asuka. Your freezing cold."  
"哎，别抱怨了，明日香。你冷得要命。"

"Fine," she snapped at him.  
"好吧，"她厉声对他说。

They both looked at the ground for a while before Shinji said, "Come on lets go back. Misato's worried sick about you."  
他们俩都盯着地面好一会儿，然后真嗣说："走吧，我们回去。美里担心得要命。"

"No, I still don't want to live in the same house as you."  
"不，我还是不想和你住在同一个屋檐下。"

"What, you have another place to go, or where you planning to sleep outside?"  
"怎么，你有别的地方可去，还是打算露宿街头？"

Asuka flushed angrily at what he said about her not having a place to sleep. "Anythings better than having to share an apartment with you, idiot."  
听到他说她无处可睡，明日香气得脸红。"总比和你这个白痴共住一个公寓强。"

"Fine then," sighed Shinji. "Have fun spending the night under a cardboard box."  
"好吧，"真嗣叹了口气。"祝你睡纸箱愉快。"

He turned to leave but felt her grab onto his wrist. He smiled slightly, 'Hmph figures.'  
他转身欲走，却感觉她抓住了他的手腕。他微微一笑，'哼，意料之中。'

She spun him around with surprising force and gave him something reminiscent of a smile. "Fine, you win, idiot. I'll stay at Misato's place until I find a proper place to stay. However," and here her tone turned deathly cold. "If I ever catch you sneaking into my room in the middle of the night, or peeking at me in the shower, I'll be sure to kick you so hard in the balls you'll have to have them surgically removed out of your ass."  
她以惊人的力量将他转过身来，给了他一个类似微笑的表情。"好吧，你赢了，傻瓜。我会暂时住在美里那里，直到找到合适的地方。不过，"说到这里，她的语气变得极其冰冷。"如果我再发现你半夜溜进我房间，或者偷看我洗澡，我一定会狠狠踢你的蛋蛋，让你不得不从屁股里做手术取出来。"

She walked past him, but not before giving him a light jab on his shoulder. 'What did I just do,' asked Shinji to himself? 'I actually convinced her to stay. I must be loosing my mind. I won't last till sunrise.'  
她从他身边走过，临走前轻轻戳了一下他的肩膀。'我刚才做了什么？' 真嗣自问。'我居然说服她留下来了。我一定是疯了。我撑不到天亮了。'

---

Asuka arrived back at Misato's apartment a little ahead of Shinji. Shinji hadn't wanted to give her an excuse to start physically abusing him again and walked several paces behind her.  
明日香比真嗣早一步回到了美里小姐的公寓。真嗣不想给她再次动手打自己的借口，于是故意落后她几步。

When Asuka walked back into Misato's apartment Misato threw her arms around Asuka and gave her a big hug. Shinji arrived back in time to see this and had to suppress a grin. 'Maybe it wont be so bad. Having her stay here.'  
当明日香走进美里小姐的公寓时，美里张开双臂给了她一个大大的拥抱。真嗣刚好赶到，看到这一幕，忍不住想笑。'也许她住在这里不会太糟糕。'

Misato let go of Asuka and now walked over to Shinji and gave him the same big hug. Shinji felt that his back was about ready to split in two. He looked over Misato's shoulder and saw that Asuka was laughing at him silently. The difference it brought to her features was astounding. Where before their had been moody, angry German girl, their now stood someone who seemed rather friendly, Shinji smirked at her slightly. Seeing this Asuka stopped laughing and gave him a scowl before she walked past them, to her room and slammed the sliding door to a close only to have it bounce back open.  
美里放开明日香，走向真嗣，同样给了他一个大大的拥抱。真嗣感觉自己的背快要被压断了。他透过美里的肩膀看到明日香在无声地嘲笑他。她的表情变化令人惊叹。之前还是个阴沉、愤怒的德国女孩，现在却显得相当友好。真嗣微微对她笑了笑。看到这一幕，明日香停止了笑声，瞪了他一眼，然后走过他们，回到自己的房间，用力拉上推拉门，结果门又弹了回来，敞开着。

"DAMN JAPANESE DOORS! CAN'T I EVEN GET SOME PRIVACY!? I'M GONNA NEED TO GET A LOCK ON THIS THING TO KEEP THAT IDIOT OUT!"  
"该死的日本门！我连一点隐私都得不到吗？！我得在这东西上装个锁，把那个白痴挡在外面！"

Shinji just laughed at her outburst and walked to his own room feeling suddenly tired. Flopping down on his own futon he couldn't help but feel slightly happy that he would be living together with Asuka. Rolling over onto his side he turned of his SDAT and fell asleep.  
真嗣只是对她的大喊大笑，然后走向自己的房间，突然感到疲惫。他扑倒在榻榻米上，忍不住感到一丝高兴，因为他将与明日香同住。翻身侧躺，他关掉了 SDAT，沉沉睡去。

### Chapter 2: The Chosen Child  
第二章：被选中的孩子  

**Posting Chapter 2 along with chapter 1. Its just how I do things. Get a nice long stream of chapters and post them together. Well I've also got another story going at the same time and that one currently takes precedence over this one. So don't expect to see this update as much as I (or you) would like it.  
与第一章一起发布第二章。我就是这么做事的。先写好一长串章节，然后一起发布。另外，我还有另一部作品同时在进行，目前那部作品优先级更高。所以别指望这部作品会像我（或你）希望的那样频繁更新。**

---

Touji and Kensuke were sitting at their desks waiting for class to start, and talking about none other than Asuka.  
当真和健介坐在他们的课桌旁，等待上课开始，谈论的正是明日香。

"I can't believe that we get a girl as hot as she is, and to think she's foreign. Just thinking about her gets me rigid," said Touji.  
"真不敢相信我们能遇到像她这么火辣的女孩，而且还是个外国人。光是想到她，我就硬了，" 东治说道。

Kensuke just nodded his consent aware that the same thing happened every time she walked by him. "I brought my best camera today just incase in case I was able to get a view up her skirt."  
真嗣只是点头表示同意，他知道每次她从他身边走过时，同样的事情都会发生。"我今天带了我最好的相机，以防万一我能拍到她的裙底风光。"

Touji turned to his friend, grabbed him by the shoulders and said, "If you do be sure to give a copy to me. That's gonna be some of the best jerk off material that we can get our hands on."  
东治转向他的朋友，抓住他的肩膀说："如果你拍到了，一定要给我一份。那将成为我们能弄到的最棒的打飞机素材。"

"What kind of underwear do you think she wears," asked Kensuke.  
“你觉得她会穿什么样的内衣？” 真嗣问道。

"With luck a silky red thong with matching bra if were lucky," replied Touji as he was fantasizing about it.  
“希望是红色丝质丁字裤配同款胸罩，如果运气好的话，” 东治一边回答一边幻想着。

Just then the two of them were brought out of their discussion by loud voices coming from the hall way.  
就在这时，走廊传来的嘈杂声打断了他们的讨论。

"What the fuck do mean you let Misato make our lunches for us today. You know how bad of a cook she is right?"  
“你他妈什么意思，让美里今天给我们做午饭？你知道她厨艺有多糟糕吧？”

Touji and Kensuke heard a loud audible sigh, then a response, "Hai Asuka, but I was to tired from last night to bother making anything," came Shinji's voice  
听到一声明显的叹息后，传来真嗣的声音：“嗨，明日香，但我昨晚太累了，懒得做任何东西。”

Kensuke and Touji's eyes widened in fear. 'Since when were Asuka and Shinji on a first name basis. 'And what the fuck did Shinji mean when he was to tired from last night. Surely they didn't have sex.'  
"健介和透治的眼睛因恐惧而睁大。‘明日香和真嗣什么时候开始直呼其名了？’‘还有真嗣说的昨晚太累是什么意思？他们该不会是……’”

The classroom door was then thrown open and in stepped the familiar German red head who every male had recently had thoughts about in their showers at home.  
教室的门突然被猛地推开，随即走进来的是那位熟悉的德国红发女孩，最近每个男生在家洗澡时都会想起她。

"Shinji no baka, how the fuck do expect me to eat the shit called food that Misato makes."  
“真嗣你个笨蛋，你他妈怎么指望我吃美里做的那堆狗屎一样的食物。”

"Then just eat the school food," said Shinji starting to get annoyed.  
“那就吃学校的食物吧，”真嗣开始感到不耐烦地说。

Asuka wheeled around and grabbed him by the shirt before yelling at him, "That shits almost as worse as Misato's cooking. I'd rather starve then eat it."  
明日香猛地转身，一把抓住他的衬衫，冲他吼道：“那玩意儿简直和美里做的饭一样糟糕。我宁愿饿死也不吃。”

"THEN STARVE," yelled Shinji back at her finally losing his patience.  
“那就饿死吧！”真嗣朝她吼回去，终于失去了耐心。

Asuka was surprised at his outburst. She always got what she wanted and she wasn't about to let him make a fool of herself in class. Drawing back her hand she intended to slap him with everything she had but he caught her hand as it was brought up to his face. She was now frozen in silent disbelief. 'This weak ass coward has the nerve to touch me. Well, he won't be standing much longer.' Now she brought up her knee and intended to knee him in the balls but she was frozen when she heard his comment.  
明日香对他的爆发感到惊讶。她总是能得到她想要的，绝不允许他在班上让自己出丑。她收回手，打算用尽全力扇他一巴掌，但他的手在她抬手到脸前时抓住了她。她现在僵住了，无声地难以置信。“这个懦弱的胆小鬼居然敢碰我。哼，他站不了多久了。”她抬起膝盖，打算用膝盖顶他的下体，但听到他的话时她僵住了。

"Incase you haven't realized Asuka their is only a certain amount of shit that I can take before I get pissed off and let it all out. So if you ever want to see the angry side of me continue to do what your doing. I've got enough hate built up over the span of my life, and wouldn't mind sending it all in your direction."  
“如果你还没意识到的话，我告诉你，明日香，我忍耐的极限是有限的，一旦超过我就会爆发。所以如果你想见识我生气的样子，就继续做你现在做的事。我这一生积累了足够的恨意，不介意全部发泄在你身上。”

Shinji let go of her hand and walked over to his desk, only realizing now that their fight was witnessed by the whole class. 'Maybe they'll think twice before talking behind my back.'  
真嗣松开了她的手，走到自己的桌前，这时才意识到他们的争吵被全班同学看到了。“也许他们以后在背后议论我之前会三思。”

Every male in the class was now looking at Shinji with absolute loathing. "Where the hell does he get off yelling at Asuka like that," said somebody whispering to their friend.  
班上所有的男生现在都用绝对厌恶的眼神看着真嗣。“他到底凭什么那样对明日香大吼大叫，”有人低声对朋友说。

"It looks like Asuka is in shock over what happened."  
"看起来明日香对刚才发生的事感到震惊。"

"Well, can't blame her, she's a new student and she now knows how much of an ass Shinji is."  
"嗯，也不能怪她，她是个新生，现在知道了真嗣有多混蛋。"

Asuka stood their for several minutes still looking straight ahead. This was the first time that she had ever been yelled at like that before, not even her step mother who she loathed. Getting control of herself she walked over to her desk, ignoring the fact that Shinji was behind her, and sat down.  
明日香站在那里好几分钟，依旧直视前方。这是她第一次被人那样吼，就连她讨厌的继母也没有过。她控制住自己，走到桌前，无视身后的真嗣，坐了下来。

Most of the class continued to stare at the two of them, though they were both staring off into space completely unaware of the stares they were getting.  
班上大部分同学继续盯着他们俩，尽管他们俩都茫然地望着远方，完全没有意识到自己正被人盯着。

---

During lunch Shinji was starting to have regrets about blowing up in Asuka's face. But she really was so damn bitchy sometimes. He thought that after last night they could have gotten along fairly well but that morning wasn't very fun.  
午餐时，真嗣开始后悔对明日香发火。但她有时候真的太刻薄了。他原以为经过昨晚他们能相处得不错，但今早并不愉快。

Shinji had woken up to his alarm going off and saw that he had almost no time to get ready. He had taken a quick shower tossed on some clothes and ran into the kitchen only to find Asuka sitting their tapping her finger on the table.  
真嗣被闹钟吵醒，发现自己几乎没有时间准备。他匆匆洗了个澡，套上衣服，冲进厨房，却发现明日香坐在那里，用手指敲打着桌子。

She had given him a sour look and just said food. Shinji had raised his eyebrows at this point and had asked why she didn't make it herself. He remembered that this was the start of one of her bitchy moods again. She had said that since Misato was such a lousy cook then it was his job to cook for her every morning before school and every afternoon when they came home.  
她给了他一个酸溜溜的眼神，只说了句“食物”。此时，真嗣挑了挑眉，问她为什么不自己动手。他记得这标志着她又一次进入了那种刻薄的情绪。她声称，既然美里是个糟糕的厨师，那么每天早上上学前和下午回家后，为他准备饭菜就成了他的职责。

Shinji had refused at first but then after receiving a sharp blow to the face he gave in and cooked her something that he had never tried since she didn't seem to like Japanese food. All in all he thought that his first attempt at a German breakfast was rather decent. Even Asuka seemed to think the sauerkraut was good, though she didn't mention anything of it.  
起初，真嗣拒绝了，但在脸上挨了一记重击后，他妥协了，为她做了些自己从未尝试过的东西，因为她似乎不喜欢日本料理。总的来说，他认为自己第一次尝试做德国早餐还算不错。就连明日香似乎也觉得酸菜不错，尽管她对此只字未提。

Then though when they were just about to leave Asuka had demanded that he also make lunch for them. Shinji had simply pointed to two sack lunches that were obviously supposed to be for them. Asuka had said that Misato had made those and that their was no way that she was going to touch anything that Misato cooked. Shinji could understand her reasoning, he had already had a bad experience with Misato who didn't even seem to know how to cook rice.  
然而，就在他们即将离开时，明日香要求他也为他们准备午餐。真嗣只是指了指两个显然是为他们准备的便当。明日香说那是美里做的，她绝不会碰美里做的任何东西。真嗣能理解她的理由，他之前已经有过一次糟糕的经历，美里甚至连煮饭都不会。

Asuka however had thrown her sack lunch at Shinji's face spilling the contents all over his face and forcing him to take a shower. Which made her even more pissed at him for almost making them late.  
然而，明日香却将她的便当袋扔向了真嗣的脸，里面的东西洒了他一脸，逼得他不得不去洗澡。这让她更加恼火，因为他差点让他们迟到。

Now though as Shinji had his back against railing up on the school roof he was starting to wish that he had just done what she asked. In truth he wanted to be her friend but she just blew off his attempts to make conversation when yesterday she had practically tried to seduce him. Though if he had done anything he assumed she would have kicked him in the balls. Suddenly he heard the opening and closing of a door and looked around to see two of his class mates, Touji and Kensuke. Touji was standing their rather threatening cracking his knuckles while Kensuke was holding his camera up as though preparing to start taking pictures.  
现在，真嗣背靠在学校屋顶的栏杆上，开始后悔没有听她的话。实际上，他很想和她做朋友，但昨天她几乎试图引诱他，而今天却对他的搭话置之不理。尽管如此，如果他真的做了什么，他猜她会一脚踢向他的下体。突然，他听到了开门和关门的声音，转头一看，是他的两个同学，东治和健介。东治站在那里，威胁性地活动着手指，而健介则举着相机，似乎准备开始拍照。

Shinji raised an eyebrow up at them and asked, "What do you two want."  
真嗣对他们挑了挑眉，问道：“你们两个想要什么？”

Touji's response was a mean right hook to the side of Shinji's face.  
冬二回敬的是一记狠辣的右勾拳，直击真嗣的脸颊。

Shinji was caught unaware and went flying to the concrete landing hard and reopening his cut that he had received when Misato almost ran him over. Feeling a steady pain in his arm and something warm trickling down and dripping down on the ground he looked up only to be greeted by another punch of Touji's.  
真嗣毫无防备，被击飞到水泥地上，重重摔落，之前被美里差点撞到时留下的伤口再次裂开。他感到手臂持续疼痛，有温热的液体缓缓流下，滴落在地。抬头一看，迎接他的却是冬二的又一拳。

This next one dazed him slightly as he saw white spots in front of him. Wiping a trickle of blood that had appeared at the side of his mouth he heard Touji say, "You little shit. What the fuck where you harassing Asuka for this morning."  
这一拳让他有些晕眩，眼前出现了白点。他擦去嘴角渗出的一丝血迹，听到冬二说道：“你这个小混蛋，早上干嘛骚扰明日香？”

Shinji would have loved to retort that she had it coming but felt like his head was going to split open any moment. It didn't help that Kensuke had now started taking pictures and was making his vision fade and turn blurry. Shinji then felt a sharp jab to his stomach and felt all the wind knocked out of him including his lunch. Wiping his mouth again which now tasted like blood and bile he looked up again to see Touji looking down on him, disgust all over his face.  
真嗣本想反驳说她自找的，但感觉自己的头随时都要裂开似的。更糟糕的是，健介现在开始拍照，让他的视线变得模糊不清。接着，真嗣感到腹部一阵剧痛，仿佛所有的空气连同午餐都被击飞了。他再次擦了擦嘴，现在嘴里满是血和胆汁的味道。他抬头一看，只见东治俯视着他，满脸的厌恶。

Touji then picked him up by the collar of his shirt and gave him a final warning, "If I ever see you yelling at Asuka again I'll make sure that you lose more than just your lunch."  
东治随后揪住他的衣领将他提起，给了他最后的警告：“如果我再看到你对明日香大喊大叫，我保证你失去的不仅仅是午餐。”

Looking up slowly at the jocks face Shinji smirked with what remained of his consciences and said, "If you were living with the redheaded bitch then you wouldn't be so inclined to hitting me." Upon saying this Shinji felt a blow to the front of his face and felt his nose breaking spewing blood everywhere before he passed out.  
真嗣缓缓抬头看着东治的脸，用仅存的意识冷笑道：“如果你和那个红发婊子住在一起，你就不会这么想打我了。”话音刚落，真嗣感到脸上重重一击，鼻子断裂，鲜血四溅，随后便失去了意识。

---

The first thing Shinji realized when he was conscious again was that someone had woken him up with a light pound on the top of his head. The second thing he realized was that his whole head was on fire. Touching the side of his face he felt a sticky sensation and pulled his hand away to see crimson blood on his hand. Remembering what had happened he put his had up to his nose and felt that it had been bent into a weird angle. Wincing slightly at how it felt he now moved his tongue around in his mouth to see if any teeth had been knocked loose. Not finding any he spit on the ground expecting to see blood but only seeing white saliva.  
当真嗣再次恢复意识时，他首先意识到的是有人用轻轻一击唤醒了他。接着，他意识到整个头部如同着火一般剧痛。他触摸脸颊，感觉到一种粘稠的感觉，抽回手时，手上沾满了鲜红的血。回想起发生的事情，他将手伸向鼻子，感觉到鼻梁已经扭曲成了一个奇怪的角度。微微皱眉，感受着这种不适，他开始在嘴里转动舌头，检查是否有牙齿松动。没有发现松动的牙齿，他吐了一口在地上，期待看到血迹，却只看到了白色的唾液。

"Thats disgusting," a voice in front of him said. "By the way you look like shit."  
“真恶心，”一个声音在他面前说道，“顺便说一句，你看起来糟透了。”

Shinji looked up and was surprised to see Asuka standing over him with a frown on her face. A mixture of emotions surged through Shinji including, loathing, spite, self hatred, and for some reason longing. How the hell he could still like her even with this being partially her fault for him ending up in this mess, he didn't know. Though now that he looked at her face more closely he thought he saw something else hidden behind that frown of hers, worry. Even so Shinji didn't want to have her laughing in his face so he rudely said, "What do you want?"  
真嗣抬头一看，惊讶地发现明日香正皱着眉头站在他面前。一股复杂的情绪涌上心头，包括厌恶、怨恨、自我憎恨，还有不知为何的渴望。他不知道自己怎么还能喜欢她，尽管这一切在某种程度上也是她的错，让他陷入这种困境。不过，现在仔细看她的脸，他觉得在那皱眉背后还隐藏着别的情绪，是担忧。即便如此，真嗣不想让她嘲笑自己，于是粗鲁地问道：“你想干嘛？”

Asuka was surprised at this tone of voice and said, "Nothing really, I just decided to skip class and was wandering around when I saw you passed out up here. What happened anyway."  
明日香对这种语气感到惊讶，说道：“没什么，我只是决定逃课，四处闲逛时看到你在这里昏倒了。到底发生了什么？”

Now Shinji could definitely detect the worry in her voice. "Why do you care? I figured seeing me like this would make you happy."  
现在真嗣可以肯定她的声音里带着担忧。“你为什么关心？我以为看到我这样你会高兴。”

This brought a sour look to Asuka's, "Asshole, why would I be happy about something like this."  
这让明日香露出了厌恶的表情，“混蛋，我怎么可能为这种事高兴。”

'And yet you seem to enjoy hitting me every chance you get,' thought Shinji. Giving her a final look he sighed and said, "Touji, that big dumb jock felt like fucking up my face after our little argument this morning."  
“尽管如此，你似乎每次有机会都要打我一顿，”真嗣心想。他最后看了她一眼，叹了口气说，“东治，那个大块头傻瓜，今天早上我们吵了一架后，他就想把我的脸打烂。”

Asuka starred back at him in surprise, "You mean that baka did this to you just because you yelled at me."  
明日香惊讶地回望着他，“你是说那个笨蛋就因为你对我吼了一声就把你打成这样？”

"Surprised? Expected for him to kick the shit out of me even more, I assume."  
"惊讶吗？我猜你以为他会把我打得屁滚尿流吧。"

Asuka looked back at him annoyed, "Why the hell do you think I'm enjoying this. It sickens me really."  
明日香回头恼怒地看着他，"为什么你他妈会觉得我喜欢这个。这真的让我恶心。"

"Hmph," was all Shinji managed to say.  
"哼，" 真嗣只能说出这么一句。

Suddenly he felt something soft hit his face and looked up to see a white rag hanging over the side of his head. Looking over in Asuka's direction he saw that she was watching him expectingly.  
突然，他感到有什么柔软的东西打在了脸上，抬头一看，发现一块白布挂在了他的头侧。他朝明日香的方向看去，只见她正期待地看着他。

"Thats to clean yourself off with. Now get a move on. I feel like vomiting from all that blood."  
“那是用来擦干净自己的。现在快点行动。我因为那些血感到想吐。”

Shinji nodded his consent and proceeded to wipe as much of the blood off of his face as he could. His white shirt was ruined though, the blood had already stained it.  
真嗣点头同意，开始尽可能地擦掉脸上的血迹。不过他的白衬衫已经毁了，血迹已经渗了进去。

"Why are you being nice to me all the sudden anyway, Asuka?"  
“为什么你突然对我这么好，明日香？”

Asuka who had had her back turned to him now wheeled around and said, "Don't get any ideas. I just feel like this is a good way for me to repay you for what you did last night. Also...I...feel that some of this...is well, my fault."  
背对着他的明日香转过身来，说道：“别多想。我只是觉得这样能回报你昨晚做的事。而且……我……觉得有些事情……嗯，是我的错。”

Shinji thought that his brain had shut down momentarily and he had miss heard what she just said. "Asuka, well, umm thanks. But this is more my fault. I was the one that got angry and yelled at you. Also, while Touji was hitting me, I kind of said somethings not so nice about you. I regret saying those now, it was more of the heat of the moment and I was still angry with you."  
真嗣觉得自己的大脑可能暂时关闭了，他怀疑自己听错了她的话。“明日香，嗯，谢谢。但这更多是我的错。是我生气了，对你大喊大叫。而且，当东治打我的时候，我好像说了一些不太好听的话。我现在后悔说了那些，那只是当时情绪激动，我还在生你的气。”

"Baka Shinji..." "笨蛋真嗣..."

Shinji continued to wipe the blood of his face while Asuka leaned over the railing and watched down town Tokyo-3. Shinji was surprised however when she crouched down next to him and frowned at his face. "You missed a spot by the way, bottom left lip."  
真嗣继续擦拭着脸上的血迹，而明日香则倚在栏杆上，俯视着东京-3 的市区。然而，当她蹲在他身边，皱着眉头看他的脸时，真嗣感到惊讶。“顺便说一句，你漏了一块，左下唇。”

Shinji hastily whipped the corner of his mouth, "Gone now?"  
真嗣急忙擦了擦嘴角，“现在干净了吗？”

Asuka laughed which again seemed to change the way she looked. "Yeah, you look a lot better."  
明日香笑了，这笑容似乎又改变了她的模样。“是啊，你看起来好多了。”

Now they stood their hanging over the railing looking at downtown Tokyo-3.  
现在他们站在那里，俯瞰着东京-3 的市中心。

"Hey Asuka how come you decided to skip class. Surely it wasn't to look for me."  
“嘿，明日香，你怎么决定逃课了？肯定不是为了找我吧。”

"What you baka. Of course not. I've already learned everything you guys are covering. Don't forget I graduated from a university at the age of fourteen. I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for...certain reasons."  
"你这个笨蛋。当然不是。我已经学完了你们正在学的一切。别忘了我十四岁就大学毕业了。如果不是因为...某些原因，我根本不会在这里。"

Shinji would have liked to know what those certain reasons but knew better than to ask. Suddenly he was pulled away from his thoughts when he saw Asuka reaching into the pocket of her blouse to pull out her phone.  
真嗣很想知道那些特定原因是什么，但他知道最好不要问。突然，他的思绪被拉了回来，因为他看到明日香把手伸进她的衬衫口袋里拿手机。

"Hai, yes I'm at school...I'll tell you later...NO!...You want me to come in?...Another one...hai, hai, I'll head their right now...OK see you soon." With that she hung up the phone and turned to Shinji. "Sorry baka but I've got some things that I've got take care of so I got to go. Though I expect you to have dinner cooked for me when I get home."  
"嗨，是的，我在学校...我稍后告诉你...不！...你想让我进去吗？...又一个...嗨，嗨，我马上过去...好的，待会儿见。" 说完，她挂了电话，转向真嗣。"抱歉，笨蛋，但我有些事情要处理，所以我得走了。不过我希望我回家时你已经把晚饭做好了。"

"Err what time will that be."  
"呃，那会是什么时候？"

Asuka knew that it could be anytime from now till the next day but just said sometime after six, hopefully.  
明日香知道这可能从现在到明天任何时候，但还是说大概六点后，希望如此。

"OK I'll have it ready when you get back. And Misato should be back around the same time to."  
"好的，你回来时我会准备好的。还有美里应该也差不多同一时间回来。"

Asuka didn't want to let on how close he was, just nodded and said that she would see him later that night.  
明日香不想透露自己有多接近他，只是点点头说晚上会再见他。

---

'Hmm I wonder what Asuka will want for dinner. She hates everything we Japanese eat so...I could go online I suppose and find something that she might like. Then again I think I read somewhere about something called Jagerschnitzel...err what did it include again.'  
'嗯，不知道明日香晚餐想吃什么。她讨厌我们日本人吃的一切……或许我可以上网找些她可能喜欢的东西。不过，我记得在某处读到过一种叫炸肉排的东西……呃，它包含什么来着？'

Suddenly Shinji was brought out of his train of thought when an announcement boomed through all of Tokyo-3. "The JSSDF has announced that Tokyo-3 will be going into lock down. All citizens will please head to the nearest shelter. I repeat all citizens will you please head to the nearest shelter. That is all."  
突然，真嗣的思绪被东京-3 全境的广播打断。"东京-3 特别防卫队宣布，东京-3 将进入封锁状态。请所有市民前往最近的避难所。重复一遍，请所有市民前往最近的避难所。完毕。"

Shinji stood their in shock, "Wonderful, what the hell could have happened that is sending all of Tokyo-3 into disarray." Not wanting to wait for something to happen Shinji quickly followed the now flashing signs that had popped up on street corners showing him the direction of the shelters.  
真嗣站在那里震惊不已，心想：“太好了，到底发生了什么鬼事情，让整个第三新东京市陷入混乱。”不想坐等事态发展，真嗣迅速跟随那些突然出现在街角的闪烁指示牌，指示着他前往避难所的方向。

Half way to the nearest shelter he stopped and thought, 'Wait what about Asuka...she'll be okay right. She heard the alarm.'  
在前往最近避难所的半路上，他停下脚步思索，‘等等，那明日香怎么办...她应该没事吧。她听到了警报。’

Running a little faster now he sped up and was soon in front of the shelter when he stopped again. 'But wait what if she is somewhere where she can't get to a shelter. Ahh why the hell am I even worrying about her. Its not like she ever showed any emotion to me.' Not true said a small voice in the back of Shinji's head. 'She obviously was worried about your condition earlier.'  
现在他跑得更快了，不久就来到了避难所前，却又再次停下。‘但是，万一她在某个无法到达避难所的地方怎么办。啊，我他妈为什么要担心她。她对我从来没表现出任何情感。’但内心深处一个小小的声音反驳道，‘她显然之前对你的状况很担心。’

'No not possible for her. Worrying about someone else is beneath her.'  
'不，她不可能的。担心别人对她来说是掉价的事。'

'Suit yourself then coward. But remember when you see her corpse, remember that you could have done something to prevent that from happening.'  
'随你便吧，懦夫。但记住，当你看到她的尸体时，记住你本可以做些什么来阻止这一切发生的。'

"GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY MIND," Shinji screamed out loud.  
“滚出我的脑海，”真嗣大声尖叫道。

"Hey kid stop screaming about random shit and get your ass in here."  
“嘿，小子，别再鬼叫那些乱七八糟的东西了，赶紧滚进来。”

Shinji looked up to see a middle aged man with his hand held out beckoning Shinji to get into shelter. "C'mon kid get in here or your gonna die."  
真嗣抬头一看，一个中年男子正伸出手招呼他进入避难所。“快点，小子，进来，不然你就要死了。”

Shinji almost put out his hand to grasp the middle aged man's hand when a small voice echoed in his mind, 'Coward.' It was the voice of Asuka and suddenly Shinji saw her as a corpse with the left side of her face torn away leaving one of her eyes dangling out of its socket. 'Where the hell where you Shinji. Cowering like the rest of them while I was trying to protect all your sorry asses. Your nothing but a coward.'  
真嗣几乎要伸出手去握住那位中年男子的手，这时一个微弱的声音在他脑海中响起：‘懦夫。’那是明日香的声音，突然间，真嗣眼前浮现出她尸体般的模样，左脸被撕裂，一只眼睛悬挂在眼眶外。‘你到底在哪里，真嗣？和其他人一样躲起来，而我却在试图保护你们这些可怜的家伙。你不过是个懦夫。’

'NO IT WASNT MY FAULT,' screamed Shinji in his head.  
'不，那不是我的错！' 真嗣在心里尖叫道。

'Yes it was, you abandoned me. I thought you cared about me. I thought something developed between us during that rainy night.'  
'是的，是你抛弃了我。我以为你关心我。我以为在那雨夜我们之间产生了某种情感。'

'HOW THE HELL, AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT I FEEL FOR YOU IF ALL YOU EVER DO IS YELL AT ME AND PUNCH ME.'  
'我他妈怎么知道我对你的感觉是什么，如果你总是对我大喊大叫还打我！'

'Wise up Shinji and find out what I'm really meaning.' The slowly rotting Asuka in Shinji's mind now put her hand up and slowly stroked the side of Shinji's face. Only now did Shinji see that the ends of some of her fingers were missing and the bones was perturbing out. 'No Asuka don't, I wont let this happen to you.'  
“醒醒吧，真嗣，弄清楚我真正的意思。”在真嗣心中逐渐腐烂的明日香举起手，缓缓抚摸着真嗣的脸颊。直到此刻，真嗣才注意到她的一些手指末端已经缺失，骨头令人不安地露了出来。“不，明日香，不要这样，我不会让你变成这样的。”

'Then you better get your sorry ass up and find me.' With that the Asuka in Shinji's mind gave him a light slap to the face jerking Shinji back to the present.  
“那你最好赶紧振作起来找到我。”话音刚落，真嗣心中的明日香轻轻扇了他一巴掌，将真嗣拉回了现实。

Shinji blinked his eyes slightly and now looked at the person with his hand extended. His appearance had changed and now he looked like a demon beckoning Shinji to hell. "C'mon kid. It will be okay. You'll be safe with us."  
真嗣微微眨了眨眼，现在看着那个伸出手的人。他的外貌变了，现在看起来像是一个召唤真嗣前往地狱的恶魔。“来吧，孩子。一切都会好起来的。跟我们在一起你会安全的。”

Shinji now looked behind him and saw that everyone had glowing red eyes. "No," said Shinji firmly. "I have something that I have to take care of. I wont be a coward anymore. I wont listen to you demons anymore."  
真嗣此刻回头一看，发现每个人的眼睛都闪着红光。“不，”真嗣坚定地说，“我有件必须要处理的事。我不会再当懦夫了。我不会再听你们这些恶魔的话了。”

With that Shinji turned his back on the shelter and walked away.  
说完，真嗣毅然决然地离开了避难所，背对着它走去。

---

Even though Shinji intended to look for Asuka he really had no idea where she was. Worse his noes which was still broken had started to bleed again and his vision was turning foggy again. 'God damn that Touji. If something happens to Asuka while I'm like this I will cut off his head,' he thought savagely.  
尽管真嗣打算去找明日香，但他其实根本不知道她在哪里。更糟糕的是，他那依然骨折的鼻子又开始流血，视线也再次变得模糊。‘该死的东治，如果我这样子的时候明日香出了什么事，我非砍了他的脑袋不可，’他恶狠狠地想。

Shinji suddenly caught his foot on the side walk and fell down hard on his chin. Shinji's teeth cut into his tongue and for a minute he thought that he had bitten his tongue off. Lying down on the side walk he spit and saw dark red in his saliva. 'Great by the time I find her I'll be a walking corpse.' Pushing himself off the ground he looked around. It appeared that he was the only person around still.  
真嗣突然绊倒在人行道上，重重地摔了个嘴啃泥。他的牙齿咬破了舌头，有那么一会儿，他以为自己把舌头咬断了。躺在人行道上，他吐了一口唾沫，看到唾液中带着暗红色。'太好了，等我找到她时，我已经是具行尸走肉了。'他用力撑起身体，环顾四周。看起来，他似乎是周围唯一的人。

'Damn it I've got to find her.' Pushing himself off the ground he suddenly fell back down when the ground start to shake. "What the fu-" was all he managed to say when the streets of Tokyo-3 started to bend and fold away into the ground. Turning around Shinji saw that the many skyscrapers where now being brought underground. Stunned at was happening he turned his head in every direction watching as buildings disappeared around him.  
'该死，我得找到她。'他用力撑起身体，突然地面开始摇晃，他又摔了回去。"搞什么鬼-"他刚开口，东京-3 的街道就开始弯曲折叠，沉入地下。真嗣转过身，看到许多摩天大楼正被带入地下。对眼前发生的一切感到震惊，他四处张望，看着建筑物在他周围消失。

"Shinji, hey Shinji, wake up, I SAID WAKE UP."  
“真嗣，嘿，真嗣，醒醒，我说了醒醒。”

Shinji felt a sharp pain to his already aching head and looked around to see Misato standing their with an anxious look on her face. "Shinji c'mon I've got to take you back to Nerv headquarters."  
真嗣感到本已疼痛的头部又是一阵剧痛，环顾四周，看到美里站在那里，脸上带着焦虑的表情。“真嗣，快点，我得带你回 NERV 总部。”

Shinji starred blankly back at her.  
真嗣茫然地回望着她。

"Shinji get up, you can't stay out here, its not safe."  
“真嗣，起来，你不能待在这里，这不安全。”

He continued to stare back at her.  
他继续盯着她。

"You wanted to help Asuka right?"  
“你想帮助明日香，对吧？”

This brought light to Shinji's eyes and he slowly stood up. "Asuka is at Nerv?"  
这使真嗣的眼睛亮了起来，他缓缓站起身。“明日香在 NERV 吗？”

Misato was afraid of how much she should tell Shinji. "Yes and I'll tell you about everything later, so lets go."  
美里担心自己该告诉真嗣多少。“是的，我稍后会把一切都告诉你，所以我们走吧。”

Shinji simply nodded and jumped into the passenger seat and Misato drove off.  
真嗣只是点点头，跳进了副驾驶座，美里便开车离开了。

---

Ten minutes later Shinji and Misato where on an elevator that was bringing them deep underground. Shinji thought that this was Nerv headquarters but never would have thought that it was directly under his feet. Finally getting control of his voice Shinji asked the question that had been nagging at him for the past ten minutes. 'Misato why are all the buildings of Tokyo-3 going underground? And why has an air raid siren been issued?"  
十分钟后，真嗣和美里在一部电梯里，电梯正将他们带到地下深处。真嗣以为这是 NERV 总部，但从未想过它就在自己脚下。终于控制住自己的声音，真嗣问出了过去十分钟一直困扰他的问题。“美里，为什么东京-3 的所有建筑都在向地下延伸？还有，为什么发布了空袭警报？”

Since Shinji had come this far Misato figured it would be best to answer some of his questions. "An Angel will be here soon and it will try to destroy us. Thats the best explanation I can give you right now, later I'll go into more detail later."  
既然真嗣已经走到了这一步，美里认为最好回答他的一些问题。“使徒很快就会来到这里，它会试图摧毁我们。这是我目前能给你的最好解释，稍后我会详细说明。”

"OK and please tell me, what is Asuka doing here, is it dangerous."  
“好的，请告诉我，明日香在这里做什么，这危险吗？”

Misato was silent for a minute before she said, "Lets just say that when everything is done she'll be glad that your here."  
美里沉默了一会儿，然后说：“这么说吧，当一切结束后，她会很高兴你在这里。”

"What did you mean by an angel anyway."  
"你说的天使到底是什么意思。"

"I told you I can't go into specifics right now, I'll tell you about it later."  
"我告诉过你现在不能细说，晚点再跟你解释。"

Shinji was surprised that Misato had snapped at him and just sat back in his seat and waited. Whatever these angels were they were making Misato panic worse then Shinji had ever seen. "They must be what the air raid is about."  
真嗣对美里突然对他发火感到惊讶，只是坐回座位等待。无论这些天使是什么，它们让美里恐慌的程度超过了真嗣所见过的任何情况。“它们一定是这次空袭的原因。”

Several minutes later Shinji found himself being ushered into something that looked strangely like the great pyramids in Egypt.  
几分钟后，真嗣发现自己被带到了一个看起来奇怪地像埃及大金字塔的地方。

"Misato wha-" "美里，这——"

"Quiet Shinji, I promise I'll explain detail but right now I need to think. Why do I always get lost when its a situation like this."  
"安静，真嗣，我保证会详细解释，但现在我需要思考。为什么每次遇到这种情况我都会迷路。"

"Well, you were always known as a bit of an air head during college," said a voice behind them.  
“嗯，你在大学时总是有点儿头脑简单，”一个声音从他们身后传来。

Misato spun around and saw her old college friend and coworker Ritsuko Akagi standing their smirking at her. "Ritsuko thank God you found me you know I always get lost around here."  
美里转过身，看到她大学时代的老朋友兼同事赤木律子站在那里，正对她露出微笑。“律子，谢天谢地你找到我了，你知道我在这儿总是迷路。”

Ritsuko simply said, "Unit 02 launched moments ago to combat the angel."  
律子只是简单地说：“2 号机刚刚出击，去对抗使徒了。”

Misato's smile fell at this bit of news. "OK I'll proceeded to the command center to take control of operations. She turned to leave but Ritsuko caught her hand, "Who's the kid," she said pointing to Shinji?  
听到这个消息，美里微笑消失了。“好的，我会前往指挥中心接管行动。”她转身要走，但律子抓住了她的手，“这孩子是谁？”她指着真嗣问道？

"Oh...well, this is the commanders son, Shinji Ikari."  
“哦……嗯，这是指挥官的儿子，碇真嗣。”

Ritsuko's eyes widened at this. "I thought the commander told you that under no circumstances were you supposed to bring him to headquarters."  
律子听到这话，眼睛睁大了。“我记得指挥官告诉过你，无论如何都不能把他带到总部来。”

"I know but Asuk...well, I found him in the middle of the street while the buildings were retracting underground. I couldn't just leave him out in the open. Also he seemed rather distressed."  
"我知道，但明日香...嗯，我在建筑物正在缩回地下的街道中央发现了他。我不能就这样把他丢在外面。而且他看起来相当不安。"

Ritsuko gave Misato a funny look before turning around and saying, "Fine but this is on your head and I have nothing to do with this. Just don't let anything happen to Unit 02."  
律子给了美里一个奇怪的表情，然后转过身说："好吧，但这事你自己负责，我可不掺和。只是别让零二号机出什么事。"

Misato looked at the back of her friend for a few seconds before turning to Shinji, grabbing his wrist and steering him in the correct direction.  
美里盯着她朋友的背影几秒钟，然后转向真嗣，抓住他的手腕，引导他走向正确的方向。

---

Shinji soon found himself in a wide room filled with computers and personal at each computer. In front of him was a massive screen that showed many different parts of Tokyo-3. He turned to ask Misato a question but saw that she was now issuing order to everyone  
不久，真嗣发现自己身处一个宽敞的房间，每台电脑前都坐着人。他面前是一块巨大的屏幕，显示着东京-3 的多个不同区域。他转身想向美里提问，却看到她正在向众人下达指令。

"What's the status of Unit 02?"  
“二号机的状态如何？”

"Pilots heart rate is seventy heart beats per minute. Sync rate is at a steady sixty-three with no signs of dropping. Umbilical cable is still attached."  
“驾驶员心率每分钟七十次。同步率稳定在六十三，没有下降迹象。脐带电缆仍连接着。”

"What about the angel...what are we calling this one?"  
"关于那个天使...我们怎么称呼这个？"

"Sachiel ma'am." "萨基尔女士。"

"Very well, what is the status of Sachiel."  
"很好，萨基尔的状况如何？"

"Computers show that its currently off the coast of Tokyo-3."  
"计算机显示它目前位于第三新东京市海岸外。"

"We are certain its an angel correct."  
"我们确定那是使徒，对吧。"

"Hai, pattern blue has been confirmed."  
"是的，已确认是蓝色模式。"

"OK, send up the rifles for Unit 02. Unit 02 will attack and destroy the enemy. What about Unit 00 by the way, has Rei recuperated enough yet to pilot it yet?"  
"好的，让 02 号单位准备好步枪。02 号单位将发起攻击并摧毁敌人。顺便问一下，00 号单位的情况如何，绫波恢复到可以驾驶了吗？"

"As for as I know no. Her right arm is still broken so she is not able to pilot it."  
"据我所知还不行。她的右臂仍然骨折，所以她还不能驾驶。"

"Very well...put Unit 01 on standby."  
"很好……让 01 号单位待命。"

Everyone looked at her. "Unit 01, I thought it was on an indefinite freeze?"  
所有人都看着她。“初号机，我以为它被无限期冻结了？”

"If we have to we will unfreeze it."  
“如果有必要，我们会解冻它。”

"What about the pilot?" “那驾驶员呢？”

Misato ignored the question and turned to the overhead screen. "Unit 02 I want you to engage the enemy away from Tokyo-3 attack it while its still off the coast."  
美里无视了这个问题，转向头顶的屏幕。“二号机，我要求你将敌人引离第三新东京市，趁它还在海岸线外时攻击它。”

"Hai," came a familiar voice over the speakers which Shinji recognized immediately.  
“明白，”扬声器中传来一个熟悉的声音，真嗣立刻就认了出来。

"As-u-ka?" “明日香？”

Misato heard him and looked around to see him starring at the screen in horror. Unit 02 was currently displayed on the screen fighting the angel. Unit 02 was painting in a bright red color which was to Asuka's liking. In its hand was a rifle which was currently zoomed in on the slowly approaching angel.  
美里听到他的声音，环顾四周，看到他正惊恐地盯着屏幕。屏幕上显示着 02 号机正在与使徒战斗。02 号机涂着鲜艳的红色，这正合明日香的心意。它手中握着一把步枪，目前正对准缓缓逼近的使徒进行瞄准。

"Asuka," said Shinji a little louder this time.  
“明日香，”真嗣这次稍微提高了声音说道。

Misato turned quickly to face him but to late. Shinji had darted to the nearest computer and wrapped his arms around the neck of the person stationed their, and pulled him backwards out of his chair. Standing over the microphone panting slightly he yelled into the microphone, "ASUKA WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF IN DANGER."  
美里迅速转身面对他，但为时已晚。真嗣已经冲到最近的电脑前，用双臂勒住坐在那里的人的脖子，将他向后拉出椅子。他站在麦克风前，微微喘息着，对着麦克风大喊：“明日香，你为什么要这样做？你不必让自己置身险境。”

Whether she heard him or not she gave no reply. Shinji was about to yell into again when he felt someone grab his wrist and drag him backwards before hitting him in the side of the face.  
无论她是否听到，她都没有回应。真嗣正要再次大喊时，突然感到有人抓住他的手腕，将他向后拖去，随后一拳打在他的脸颊上。

Shinji wasn't sure what number that made it today but he felt that his brain had finally popped loose and was floating freely in his head. Looking up slightly dazed he saw an angry Misato standing over him.  
真嗣不确定今天这是第几次了，但他感觉自己的脑子终于松动了，正自由地漂浮在脑袋里。他有些恍惚地抬头，看到愤怒的美里站在他面前。

"What do you think your doing," she hissed at him. "Under no circumstances are we allowed to bother the pilots while their in combat. I took you here knowing what charges I would face. Asuka however begged me to find you and make sure you were all right. And now you go pulling a stunt like this and-"  
“你以为你在做什么？”她低声呵斥他，“在任何情况下，我们都不允许在驾驶员战斗时打扰他们。我带你来这里，明知会面临什么指控。然而，明日香却恳求我找到你，确保你没事。现在你却做出这种事——”

Suddenly she was interrupted by one of the computer operators. "Unit 02's sync rate has dropped down to fifty-seven, fifty-six...still dropping."  
突然，一名电脑操作员打断了她。“二号机的同步率已经下降到五十七，五十六……还在继续下降。”

Misato cursed. "Keep monitoring her sync rate and heart rate let me know instantly if anything happens. What's the status on Unit 01?"  
美里咒骂了一声。“继续监控她的同步率和心率，一旦有任何情况立即通知我。初号机的情况如何？”

"The commander has lifted the freeze around it and has instructed you to do as you see fit. Though he said that under no circumstances does he want Unit 01 destroyed."  
“指挥官已经解除了对它的冻结，并指示您自行决定行动。不过他明确表示，在任何情况下都不希望初号机被摧毁。”

"I don't think he will have to worry about that."  
"我想他不必为此担心。"

Grabbing Shinji who was now sobbing on the floor she said, "If you want to help Asuka then follow my instructions."  
她抓住了在地上哭泣的真嗣，说道：“如果你想帮助明日香，那就听从我的指示。”

Shinji nodded and let her steer him towards his future.  
真嗣点点头，任由她引领自己走向未来。

---

Shinji was soon standing in front of Eva Unit 01. It looked like a demon more then anything that was supposed to defend mankind. On the way to Unit 01 Misato filled him in on everything from, the angels, Second Impact, the Eva's, and the purpose of Nerv. Shinji was now standing looking at Unit 01 digesting all the information that he had absorbed. Though throughout all Misato's information she left out everything about why Asuka was risking her life to protect him and everyone else. Shinji never would have guessed she would do that.  
真嗣很快站在了 EVA 初号机前。它看起来更像一个恶魔，而非本应守护人类的机器。前往初号机的路上，美里向他详细介绍了天使、第二次冲击、EVA 以及 NERV 的使命。真嗣现在站在初号机前，消化着所吸收的所有信息。尽管美里提供了大量信息，但她对为什么明日香会冒着生命危险保护他和所有人只字未提。真嗣从未料到她会这么做。

"Shinji," said a sudden booming voice.  
“真嗣，”一个突如其来的洪亮声音说道。

Shinji looked up past Unit 01 to a window at the top of the dock to see his father starring down at him.  
真嗣抬头望向初号机上方，码头顶端的窗户，看到他的父亲正俯视着他。

"Otou-san" "父亲大人"

"Shinji, do you know what piloting this Eva will do to change your life."  
"真嗣，你知道驾驶这个 Eva 会给你的生活带来怎样的改变吗？"

"Hai...and I'm prepared to take that responsibility. I will...protect Asuka and mankind."  
"是的...我已经准备好承担这个责任。我会...保护明日香和人类。"

His father continued to stare down at him. "Just remember that mankind as a whole is more important than a single individual."  
他的父亲继续低头盯着他。“记住，人类整体比单一个体更为重要。”

Shinji felt boiling rage at his father. 'So Asuka is just a simple object that lets you fulfill your objectives just like your using me now.'  
真嗣对他的父亲感到怒火中烧。‘所以明日香只是你实现目标的一个简单工具，就像你现在利用我一样。’

---

Gendo Ikari now cut the link between his son and himself and turned away to see his second in command Kozo Fuyutsuki standing their frowning at him.  
碇源堂切断了与儿子之间的联系，转身看到他的副手葛城美里站在那里，皱着眉头看着他。

"Is it wise to let your son pilot Unit 01."  
"让儿子驾驶初号机，明智吗？"

"Maybe not but with his help the Human Instrumentality Project will be sped up significantly. Its a risk I'm willing to take."  
"或许不明智，但有了他的帮助，人类补完计划将大大加速。这个风险我愿意承担。"

"What if _it_ happens." "万一发生了呢？"

"I have prepared for this day considerably. If _it_ does happen then I have taken the correct measures to prevent _it_ from getting out of hand. Also I still need Unit 02, for a while, so I don't want to lose it yet."  
“我已经为这一天做了充分的准备。如果真的发生了，我已经采取了正确的措施来防止事态失控。而且，我还需要 02 号机一段时间，所以现在还不想失去它。”

Kozo looked back at his friend. It was amazing how he could show so little emotion even when talking to his son. "If you think its worth it then we'll take it"  
“小藏回头看向他的朋友。令人惊叹的是，即使在与儿子交谈时，他也能表现出如此少的情感。“如果你认为值得，那我们就接受它。”

---

Shinji was sitting inside the entry plug inside Unit 01. He had received a shock when the plug had started to fill up with a clear fluid. He had at first panicked but relaxed when Misato said that it was to help him breath easier. Shinji felt slightly nauseous thought. It smelled like death somehow.  
“真嗣坐在 01 号机的插入栓内。当插入栓开始充满透明液体时，他受到了惊吓。起初他惊慌失措，但当美里说这是为了让他呼吸更顺畅时，他放松了下来。不过，真嗣还是感到有些恶心。不知为何，它闻起来像死亡的味道。”

"Shinji are you ready then."  
"真嗣，你准备好了吗？"

"Ha-hai." "哈-嗨。"

"Okay Asuka's Eva has just lost its umbilical cable so she has only five minutes left of energy left. We're sending you up elevator number five. It will put you closest to her position. When you get to the surface provide covering fire her while she dispatches the angel. Since you don't have any sync training this is as much as we expect of you."  
"好的，明日香的 EVA 刚刚失去了脐带电缆，所以她只剩下五分钟的能量了。我们派你乘坐五号电梯上去，它会把你送到离她最近的位置。当你到达地面时，为她提供掩护火力，同时她会处理掉那个使徒。由于你没有进行过同步训练，我们对你期望仅此而已。"

"Hai." "嗨。"

"Okay then release primary and secondary locks numbers one through thirteen. Have Eva Unit 01 proceeded to elevator number five."  
"好的，那么解除一到十三号主次锁定。让 Eva 初号机前往五号电梯。"

Shinji felt his Eva Unit being slowly moved forward on tracks that he couldn't see from where he was.  
真嗣感觉到他的 Eva 初号机正被看不见的轨道缓缓向前移动。

"What is Eva Unit 01's pilot sync rate," asked Misato.  
“EVA 初号机的驾驶员同步率是多少？”美里问道。

"Barely above the minimum forty-seven."  
“勉强高于最低的四十七。”

"Well, for a first time, its amazing. OK Eva Unit 01 at launch elevator. Release and close elevator shafts two, four, and seven. Propulsion system is all green. Sending Unit 01 to surface...now."  
“嗯，初次能做到这样已经很了不起了。好的，EVA 初号机，前往发射电梯。释放并关闭二号、四号和七号电梯井。推进系统一切正常。现在将初号机送往地面。”

Shinji was immediately jerked back into his seat as he felt himself rocketing up to the surface. 'Asuka please be okay,' he thought as he saw day light above him.  
真嗣立刻被猛地拽回座位，感觉自己正飞速冲向水面。'明日香，请一定要没事，'他想着，同时看到了上方的日光。

---

When Shinji first broke through to the surface he saw that Asuka and Unit 02 were being cornered against a building and was being hit repetitively.  
当真嗣首次破水而出时，他看到明日香和二号机被逼至一栋建筑旁，正遭受连续攻击。

"Damn it," yelled Shinji. "How the fuck do I even move this thing."  
“该死，”真嗣大喊，“这玩意儿到底怎么动啊。”

"Calm down Shinji," came Misato's voice. "Since the LCL fluid helps connect you to the Eva's mind all you have to do is think about moving and it will move. But you have to be concentrating really hard."  
"冷静点，真嗣，" 美里说道，"既然 LCL 液体有助于你与 Eva 的心灵连接，你只需集中精神想着移动，它就会动。但你必须非常专注。"

"Okay," said Shinji. He tried focusing on moving but an image of a slowly rotting Asuka kept on popping in his mind. 'No I promised her that I would help. I won't let that happen."  
"好的，" 真嗣说。他试图集中精力移动，但脑海中不断浮现出慢慢腐烂的明日香的形象。'不，我答应过她我会帮忙的。我不能让这种事发生。"

---

Misato was looking worriedly at the screen. "Unit 01 sync rate below minimum...what?"  
美里担忧地看着屏幕。"初号机同步率低于最低值...什么？"

Misato jerked over to the sound of the voice. "What?"  
美里听到声音猛地转过头。“什么？”

"Anomaly detected in the entry plug. Eva Unit 01 is rejecting the pilots thoughts."  
“插入栓内检测到异常。EVA 初号机正在排斥驾驶员的思维。”

"Quick eject the entry plug, protect the pilot."  
“快弹出插入栓，保护驾驶员。”

"Unable to, its rejecting the signature. Sync rate is dropping radically Eva Unit 01 has rejected the pilot and is shutting down. Life signs are dropping also. Unable to get a direct reading inside of Unit 01. Plug suit is not showing any vital signs."  
“无法执行，它在拒绝签名。同步率急剧下降，EVA 初号机已排斥驾驶员并正在关闭。生命迹象也在减弱。无法直接读取初号机内部情况。插入栓服未显示任何生命体征。”

Misato was standing horrified at Eva Unit 01. This was why no one was able to pilot it. It always rejected the pilot and killed it.  
美里站在 EVA 初号机前，惊恐万分。这就是为什么没人能驾驶它。它总是排斥驾驶员并将其杀死。

---

Inside the entry plug Shinji was gasping for breath. He had lost consciousness several times already but was still thinking over and over, 'move...move..move...move.'  
在插入栓内，真嗣喘息着。他已经多次失去意识，但仍一遍遍地想着，‘动啊...动啊...动啊...动啊...’

"GOD DAMN IT,' he screamed out loud. "I'VE GOT TO HELP ASUKA. DAMN YOU PILE OF SHIT MOVE...MOVE...move...mov-"  
"该死，'他大声咆哮。"我得去帮明日香。该死的破车，动啊...动...动...动-"

Shinji was slowly blacking out when he heard a voice in his head. 'So you want to help the person important to you.'  
真嗣渐渐失去意识时，他听到脑海中有个声音。'所以你想帮助对你重要的人。'

"Hai," he said weakly. "是的，"他虚弱地回答。

'Well I must say that out of all the pilots that have ever tried to sync with me you are easily the most interesting out of all of them. Your willpower is something to marvel at...very well I authorize you as the pilot of me Unit 01. From this day forth anybody else who tries to pilot me shall die upon entering this plug."  
“好吧，我必须承认，在所有试图与我同步的驾驶员中，你无疑是最引人注目的一个。你的意志力令人惊叹……很好，我授权你成为我的驾驶员，零一机。从今天起，任何试图驾驶我的人一旦进入驾驶舱，都将丧命。”

Shinji just smiled slightly and felt himself wake up. A faint green light was flashing on and off inside of the entry plug. It simply said Shinji Ikari.  
真嗣只是微微一笑，感觉自己醒了过来。驾驶舱内，一盏微弱的绿色灯光在闪烁。上面简单地写着：碇真嗣。

Suddenly Shinji felt white hot needles entering his skin. Looking down he saw that wires were digging into his skin and merging with his nerves. "What...are...you doing Unit 01."  
突然，真嗣感到皮肤像被滚烫的针刺入。低头一看，他发现电线正刺入他的皮肤，与他的神经融合。“零一机，你在做什么？”

'This is the only way to truly sync with me. With this I'm able to read your thought easier. Don't worry about the lose of blood. Its only temporary.'  
'这是唯一能与我真正同步的方法。这样一来，我能更容易读取你的思维。别担心失血，这只是暂时的。'

Now that Shinji looked he saw that a pool of blood was slowly building up around him, and that the LCL fluid was steadily turning into his own blood. 'Whatever,' he thought. 'As long as I save Asuka before I pass out I don't care.'  
现在，真嗣注意到自己周围正慢慢形成一滩血迹，LCL 液体也在逐渐变成他自己的血液。'无所谓了，'他想，'只要能在昏倒前救出明日香，我不在乎。'

'Thats what I like to hear,' said Eva Unit 01. 'Though if you don't mind its been a while since I was let loose like this so I'd like to have a little fun.'  
'我就喜欢你这种态度，'初号机说道，'不过，如果你不介意的话，我已经有段时间没这么自由了，所以我想稍微玩一玩。'

'What are you-' but then Shinji felt two hot wires pierce his temples and he knew no more.  
'你这是在——' 但随即，真嗣感到两股灼热如电的刺痛穿透了他的太阳穴，之后便一无所知了。

---

Shinji woke up to hear the sound of voices around him.  
真嗣醒来时，耳边环绕着周围的说话声。

"Its amazing that he survived with all the blood he lost."  
“他流了那么多血还能活下来，真是奇迹。”

"Even more amazing that Tokyo-3 isn't destroyed thanks to Unit 01 going berserk."  
"更令人惊叹的是，多亏了零号机发狂，第三新东京市竟然没有被摧毁。"

"Tell me what happened when you opened the entry plug again Misato?"  
"告诉我，当你再次打开插入栓时发生了什么，美里？"

"Shinji was just floating their with his plug suit on. All the controls had disappeared and he had those weird wires connected all along his body. What was even more disturbing was that the LCL fluid had mixed with his blood."  
"真嗣就那样穿着插入服漂浮在那里。所有的控制装置都消失了，他身上布满了奇怪的电线。更令人不安的是，LCL 液体已经和他的血液混合在一起了。"

"Doctor Akagi is that even possible?"  
"Doctor Akagi，这真的可能吗？"

"Theoretically yes, though its never been proven before."  
"理论上是的，尽管以前从未被证实过。"

Shinji slowly opened his eyes and saw a crowd of people around him.  
真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛，发现自己被一群人围着。

"Well, at least the angel was dispatched."  
"好吧，至少天使已经被派遣了。"

"Yes and thankfully Asuka had enough energy to disconnect Unit 01's umbilical cable or Unit 01 would still be rampaging around Tokyo-3."  
"是的，幸好明日香还有足够的能量断开 01 号机的脐带电缆，否则 01 号机还会在第三新东京市肆虐。"

Shinji opened his eyes wide at the mention of Asuka's named and looked back at everyone that was crowded around his bed, most of them which he had never seen before.  
听到明日香的名字，真嗣睁大了眼睛，回头看着围在他床边的众人，其中大多数他从未见过。

"What, where am I," he asked?  
"什么，我在哪里？" 他问道。

"Nerv hospital," replied Misato.  
"NERV 医院，" 美里回答道。

"What...how...I." "什么...怎么...我。"

"Calm down Shinji, everything is okay. The angel was defeated."  
"冷静点，真嗣，一切都好。使徒已经被打败了。"

Suddenly Shinji sat bolt upright which surprised everyone. "What happened to Asuka, where is she."  
突然，真嗣猛地坐直了身子，这让所有人都吃了一惊。“明日香怎么了，她在哪儿？”

"Right here baka." "就在这儿，笨蛋。"

Shinji looked around and saw Misato and Ritsuko move out of the way as Asuka walked up to Shinji's bed.  
真嗣环顾四周，看到美里和律子让开了路，让明日香走到真嗣的床边。

Misato motioned to Ritusko and everyone else to let the two be alone, and they left the room leaving the two teens to sort things out.  
美里示意律子和其他人让这对年轻人单独相处，他们便离开了房间，留下两个少年去解决问题。

With everyone gone Asuka sat down on the edge of Shinji's bed and looked out the window. Shinji meanwhile sat back down and was somehow comforted that she was next to him.  
所有人都离开后，明日香坐在真嗣床边，望向窗外。与此同时，真嗣也坐了回去，不知为何，她在他身边让他感到安慰。

"Why did you do that," asked Asuka breaking the silence.  
“你为什么要那么做？”明日香打破了沉默问道。

"Err do what," replied Shinji.  
“呃，做什么？”真嗣回答道。

Asuka turned to face him, took a deep breath and said, "Why did you risk your life, to the point of bleeding to death to help me."  
明日香转向他，深吸了一口气，说道：“你为什么要冒着生命危险，甚至流血至死来帮我。”

Shinji didn't even need to think about. "Well, this may sound stupid to you...and I don't care what you think but, even though we argue a lot and don't seem to get along...you're the first person that I've been able to talk to easily. I guess you could say that your my first friend."  
真嗣甚至不需要思考。“嗯，这对你来说可能听起来很蠢……而且我不在乎你怎么想，但尽管我们经常争吵，看起来相处得并不好……你是我第一个能轻松交谈的人。我想你可以说，你是我的第一个朋友。”

"You mean you've never had friends before me?"  
“你是说，在我之前你从来没有过朋友？”

"No, I've always been on the move my entire life. My father sent me from place to place so I never got to know people. Eventually I just shut everyone out around me since I knew that I would only be leaving eventually."  
“是的，我一生都在四处奔波。我父亲把我从一个地方送到另一个地方，所以我从没机会认识人。最终，我只是把自己封闭起来，因为我知道我迟早会离开。”

"Is that why you seem to hate your father so much?"  
"那就是你为什么似乎如此憎恨你父亲的原因吗？"

"Yes,"...'That and the fact that he abandoned me and let my mother die,' though Shinji thought this to himself.  
"是的，"...'还有他抛弃了我，让我母亲死去的事实，' 虽然真嗣只是在心里这么想。

Asuka was furious for some reason at Shinji. "You baka, I can take care of myself."  
不知为何，明日香对真嗣感到愤怒。"你这个笨蛋，我能照顾好自己。"

"I know its just-" Shinji didn't want to tell her about the vision he had of her rotting corpse.  
"我知道这只是——" 真嗣不想告诉她关于她腐烂尸体的幻象。

"Just what?" “什么意思？”

"Nothing, forget about it."  
"没什么，忘了吧。"

They both sat in silence for a while, then Asuka asked the next question. "What happened to you anyway...back their inside Eva Unit 01. It went berserk and tried to destroy everything in sight, including me...you weren't controlling it were you?"  
他们俩沉默地坐了一会儿，然后明日香问了下一个问题。"你到底怎么了……在那边，在 Eva 初号机里。它发狂了，试图摧毁视线中的一切，包括我……你不是在控制它，对吧？"

"No, Asuka I could never harm you. I don't remember much after I blacked out, but the Eva said that it would protect you if I let it have a little fun"  
"不，明日香，我绝不会伤害你。我昏迷后记不太清了，但 Eva 说只要让它稍微玩一下，它就会保护你。"

"So you didn't care what happened to Tokyo-3, as long as I was safe you were happy?"  
"所以你不在乎东京-3 发生什么，只要我安全你就满意了？"

"Hai, something like." "嗯，差不多是这样。"

"You baka, I'm not worth it."  
"你这个笨蛋，我不值得你这样。"

"Sorry...I just didn't want to lose you," suddenly his eyes narrowed. "And don't say that your not worth it, because you are," her words had brought back what his father had said about one individual compared to humanity.  
"对不起...我只是不想失去你，"突然他的眼神变得锐利。"而且不要说你不值得，因为你值得，"她的话让他想起了父亲曾经说过关于一个人与整个人类的比较。

"You honestly care that much about me," asked Asuka?  
"你真的这么在乎我吗？" 明日香问道？

"Yes I do...well when your like this at least."  
"是的，我确实...至少当你这样的时候。"

"Meaning what exactly," Asuka snapped back.  
"具体是什么意思？" 明日香厉声反问。"

Shinji was entering dangerous water but plunged ahead stubbornly, "Just that when your angry and moody your not that much fun to be around."  
真嗣正踏入危险的水域，但他固执地继续说："只是觉得当你生气和情绪低落时，和你在一起就没那么有趣了。"

"What was that you baka. If you weren't so badly injured I'd give a good whack on the head...but instead I'll do this. Slowly reaching around Shinji's neck she brought him into a small one armed hug. "Thanks for worrying about me...though if you ever say I'm not fun to be around when I'm angry I guarantee that you'll make up in the middle of the night breathing through your mouth."  
"你这个笨蛋，刚才那是什么。如果不是你伤得这么重，我真想好好敲一下你的头...不过现在，我只能这样。她缓缓地绕到真嗣的脖子旁，用一只手臂轻轻地抱住了他。“谢谢你担心我...不过如果你敢说我生气时不好相处，我保证你会半夜醒来只能用嘴呼吸。”

"You know its not very threatening when you're hugging me and telling me that at the same time."  
"你一边抱着我一边说这种话，实在没什么威胁力。"

Asuka broke apart from him now and gave him a weird look before she started laughing, and Shinji joined in.  
明日香松开了他，给了他一个奇怪的眼神，然后开始大笑，真嗣也跟着笑了起来。

When Asuka stopped laughing the first thing she said was, "You need to get to sleep now. Ritsuko says that you need to spend two days here until you recover. You lost a lot of blood and it wouldn't be good for you to pass out while at Misato's apartment."  
当明日香停止笑声后，她说的第一件事是：“你现在需要去睡觉了。律子说你需要在这里待上两天直到恢复。你失血过多，在美里公寓里昏倒可不好。”

"Yeah your probably right."  
“嗯，你大概是对的。”

They both looked at each other for a while before Asuka said, "Well I'll check up on you after I get back from school I guess."  
她们彼此对视了一会儿，然后明日香说：“好吧，我想我放学后会来看你的。”

"M'kay see you then." "好的，那到时候见。"

With that Asuka walked out of the hospital and Shinji leaned back to go to sleep but heard a ear splitting racket when Asuka left.  
说完，明日香走出了医院，真嗣则靠回椅背准备入睡，但明日香离开时却传来一阵震耳欲聋的噪音。

"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU GUYS DOING. WHERE YOU JUST LISTENING INTO OUR ENTIRE CONVERSATION."  
"你们他妈的在干什么？难道一直在偷听我们的对话吗？"

Shinji had to suppress a laugh as he rolled over, 'Typical Asuka,' he thought before he drifted off to sleep.  
真嗣翻身时不得不忍住笑意，'典型的明日香，'他想道，随后便沉沉睡去。

### Chapter 3: Visions 
第三章：幻象  

**OK well, against me better judgement I am posting chapter 3. This is...I don't know how to phrase it other than I'm amazed at how this chapter ended up. Lets just say that I hit off some of the more psychological aspects with this one and it in turn developed into the story which I intend on writing now. Funny how that works with me. I never find out how the story is going until I write the first few chapters. Anyway enough of my rambling...  
好吧，尽管违背我的判断，我还是发布了第三章。这...我不知道该如何表达，除了惊讶于这一章的结局。这么说吧，我触及了一些更心理层面的内容，结果它发展成了我现在打算写的故事。有趣的是，我总是要写完前几章才能知道故事的走向。好了，我的唠叨就到此为止...**

---

Gendo Ikari was looking down at the manila envelope on his desk. "Is this the data that you received from the first fight between the third angel and the pilot of Eva Unit 01?"  
碇源堂低头看着桌上的牛皮纸信封。“这是你在第三次使徒与 EVA 初号机驾驶员第一次战斗中收到的数据吗？”

"Hai," replied Ritsuko who was standing in front of the commanders desk.  
"嗨，" 站在指挥官办公桌前的律子回答道。

"And," asked Gendo in a evened voice? "What have you found."  
"那么，" 源堂用平稳的语气问道？"你发现了什么。

"Are you asking to give me a summary of that report."  
"你是要我给你总结那份报告吗。

Gendo nodded his head and waited for a reply.  
源堂点了点头，等待着回复。

Taking a deep breath Ritsuko started talking. "It seems that at first Eva Unit 01 rejected Shinji's synchronization. Though for some reason the Eva allowed him to pilot it after Shinji became upset about something."  
深吸一口气，律子开始讲述。“起初，EVA 初号机似乎拒绝了真嗣的同步。但不知为何，真嗣因为某事变得沮丧后，EVA 却允许他驾驶了。”

"Does this pertain to Pilot 02."  
“这与二号驾驶员有关吗？”

"Hai, I believe so. Shinji was screaming something about Asuka and from what I have determined the Eva saw how much willpower Shinji possessed and allowed him to pilot it."  
"海，我相信是的。真嗣一直在尖叫关于明日香的事情，根据我的判断，Eva 看到了真嗣所拥有的意志力，因此允许他驾驶。"

"Is he still usable as a pilot?"  
"他还能作为驾驶员使用吗？"

"I can't confirm that without sync tests, commander."  
"没有同步测试，我无法确认这一点，指挥官。"

Gendo continued to look at her evenly waiting for her to continue.  
源渡继续平静地看着她，等待她继续说下去。

"Now, about Eva Unit 01's reaction. It seems that something happened inside of the entry plug between Shinji and the Eva. This is confirmed by Misato Katsuragi's testimony of what she discovered when the entry plug was removed and the LCL fluid was removed."  
“现在，关于 EVA 初号机的反应。似乎在真嗣和 EVA 之间，插入栓内发生了什么。这一点得到了葛城美里关于她在移除插入栓和 LCL 液体时所发现情况的证词的证实。”

"Meaning?" “什么意思？”

"What were originally thought to be metallic wires are the Eva's nerves. Apparently they connected directly with Shinji's nervous system so as to sync with him better. According to analysis when they synced the ratio was well above Asuka's highest ratio. It also seems that Eva Unit 01 will reject anybody that enters the entry plug and is not Shinji. We had a scientist exam the inside of the entry plug while it was inserted into the Eva. Apparently he suffered from a high level of contamination."  
"最初被认为是金属线的其实是 EVA 的神经。显然，它们直接与真嗣的神经系统相连，以便更好地同步。根据分析，当他们同步时，比例远超明日香的最高比例。似乎 EVA 初号机会排斥任何进入插入栓且不是真嗣的人。我们让一位科学家在插入栓插入 EVA 时检查其内部。显然，他遭受了高水平的污染。""

"Is that all?" "就这些吗？""

"One last thing, sir. I don't know why but when Shinji's blood mixed with the LCL fluid it omitted a reaction similar to the same pattern that an angel gives off."  
"还有最后一件事，长官。我不知道为什么，但当真嗣的血液与 LCL 液体混合时，它产生了一种类似于使徒发出的反应模式。""

"Pattern blue?" "蓝色模式？"

"Hai sir. Whatever changed with the LCL fluid made the AT field of the Eva stronger for a brief period."  
"是的，长官。LCL 液体的变化使得 EVA 的 AT 力场在短时间内变得更强了。"

Gendo leaned back in his chair now with his hands in his lap.  
碇源堂向后靠在椅子上，双手放在膝上。

"Very well then Ritsuko. If that is all you may go."  
"很好，那么，律子。如果没别的事，你可以走了。"

"Hai, commander Ikari." "明白，碇司令。"

When Ritsuko left Gendo picked up the manila file and leafed through it before pausing on a picture of his son. "Maybe I should have never brought him to Tokyo-3 in the first place."  
当律子离开后，碇源堂拿起那份马尼拉纸文件，翻阅着，直到目光停留在他儿子的照片上。"也许我一开始就不该把他带到第三新东京市。"

"And yet thanks to him we now are able to use Eva Unit 01 to its full potential," said Kozo as he stepped out of the shadows. "Though having him around still proves to be a risk."  
"然而多亏了他，我们现在能够充分发挥 Eva 初号机的全部潜力，" 高雄从阴影中走出说道。"尽管有他在身边仍然是个风险。"

"He was always a risk but we took it and see what happened."  
"他一直是个风险，但我们还是冒了这个险，看看发生了什么。"

"Yes but Ritsako's data didn't give you anything that you didn't know already."  
"是的，但律子的数据并没有给你带来任何你原本不知道的信息。"

Gendo frowned and looked down at the envelope. "Maybe, but the information about Shinji and Pilot 02 could prove to be useful."  
源堂皱了皱眉，低头看着那封信封。“或许吧，但关于真嗣和二号驾驶员的信息可能会证明是有用的。”

"Meaning," asked Kozo with a raised eyebrow.  
“你的意思是？” 高雄挑起眉毛问道。

Gendo smirked, "He's got a reason to pilot Eva Unit 01 as long as Pilot 02 is still working with Nerv."  
源堂冷笑道，“只要二号驾驶员还在与 NERV 合作，他就有理由继续驾驶 EVA 初号机。”

---

Shinji was released from the hospital two days later in a full recovery. Misato threw a party for him in his return. Though it consisted of Misato, Ritsuko, and a rather reluctant Asuka.  
两天后，真嗣完全康复出院了。美里为他举办了一个欢迎回家派对。虽然参加的只有美里、律子和一个不太情愿的明日香。

"Ah why do I have to celebrate this. Its so stupid. Its the baka's own fault for ending up like that in the first place."  
“啊，为什么我非得庆祝这个。真是蠢透了。说到底，那笨蛋自己搞成那样，怪得了谁。”

Misato paused in the middle of chugging a can of beer. "Asuka the least you could be is somewhat relieved he's at least alive."  
美里正大口喝着一罐啤酒，停了下来。“明日香，至少你可以为他还活着感到一丝欣慰吧。”

Shinji sighed and said, "Really Misato I don't care that much whether she's glad I'm here or not."  
真嗣叹了口气，说道：“真的，美里，我并不太在乎她是否高兴我在这里。”

Asuka threw Shinji a scowl and stood up and walked toward her door and slammed it shut.  
明日香瞪了真嗣一眼，站起身走向自己的房门，砰的一声关上了。

Ritsuko sighed and turned to Misato, "I heard that Kaji has been reassigned here."  
律子叹了口气，转向美里，“我听说加持已经被调到这里了。”

Misato responded by spitting out her beer spraying Shinji in the face. "WHAT, THAT JERK IS STATIONED HERE."  
美里回应的方式是吐出啤酒，喷了真嗣一脸。“什么，那个混蛋被调到这里来了。”

"Hai," said Ritsuko calmly.  
“是，”律子平静地说。

"Who's Kaji," asked Shinji.  
“谁是加持？”真嗣问道。

Misato was about to open her mouth and say he was a stuck up jerk and a pervert when Ritsuko answered for her, "He's Misato's ex boyfriend."  
美里正要张嘴说他是个自以为是的混蛋兼变态，这时律子替她回答了，“他是美里的前男友。”

Shinji was rather shocked at that and looked to see Misato steadily turning red in the face. "As if I need reminding that a dated that damn jerk." Misato turned her gaze to Shinji, "How is school going for you now?"  
真嗣对此颇为震惊，转头看到美里的脸正逐渐变红。“好像我需要提醒自己曾经和那个该死的混蛋交往过似的。”美里将目光转向真嗣，“你现在学校情况怎么样？”

Shinji shrugged and said, "Little different then normal. Except all the guys in the class hate me."  
真嗣耸了耸肩说：“和平时有点不一样。只是班上所有男生都讨厌我。”

"Why's that?" "为什么呢？"

"Because I live with Asuka, their jealous. Heh I'd like to see them try living with her for a day and survive."  
"因为我跟明日香住在一起，他们嫉妒了。呵，我倒想看看他们试着跟她住一天还能不能活下来。"

"I heard that you asshole," came a voice through a closed door.  
"我听到你这个混蛋的话了，"一个声音从关着的门后传来。"

Shinji sighed and looked at his watch. "Uh I just got back and its time for school already."  
真嗣叹了口气，看了看手表。"呃，我刚回来，又该去学校了。"

"Well, here then," said Misato as she tossed Shinji a lunch.  
"那么，给你，"美里说着将一份午餐扔给了真嗣。

Shinji tried not to look disgusted and gave her a weak smile, "Uh thanks Misato."  
真嗣尽量不表现出厌恶，给了她一个虚弱的微笑，"呃，谢谢美里。"

"No problem, theirs one for Asuka too."  
"不客气，也给明日香准备了一份。"

Shinji could hardly suppress a groan.  
真嗣几乎忍不住要呻吟出声。

"Oh and Shinji I promised you that I would take you shopping for new clothes but I won't be back till late tonight. So I want Asuka to take you instead."  
“哦对了，真嗣，我答应过要带你去买新衣服的，但我今晚要很晚才能回来。所以我想让明日香带你去。”

"WHAT THE FUCK," came a loud yell from another room.  
“搞什么鬼，”另一个房间传来一声大喊。

Asuka immediately stormed out of her room and planted both hands on the table. "What the fuck do you mean I'm supposed to take this baka out shopping," she said this while pointing at Shinji. "Thats something that a mother should do."  
明日香立刻冲出房间，双手重重地拍在桌子上。“你他妈什么意思，让我带这个笨蛋去购物？”她一边说一边指向真嗣，“这种事应该是妈妈做的。”

"Think of this as a time to get to know each other a little better so you wont be arguing all the time because to tell you the truth I'm getting annoyed with it."  
“把这当作一个增进彼此了解的机会吧，这样你们就不会总是争吵了，说实话，我对此已经感到厌烦了。”

"If this baka wasn't such an idiot and a sociopath maybe I could get along with him. But he's had about as much social interaction between two humans beings as the teachers pet, First Child."  
“如果这个笨蛋不是这么白痴和反社会，也许我能和他相处得来。但他的人际交往能力简直就像老师的宠儿，第一适格者一样糟糕。”

Misato sighed, "This is exactly what I mean. Your constant bickering is enough to drive anyone crazy."  
美里叹了口气，“这正是我想说的。你们没完没了的争吵足以把人逼疯。”

"Hell no I'm not doing this," said Asuka while folding her arm.  
“绝对不干，”明日香一边说一边抱起双臂。

"Then how bout this. I'm _ordering_ you to take Shinji shopping."  
“那这样如何。我命令你带真嗣去购物。”

"And if I refuse." "如果我拒绝呢。"

"Then we take you off Unit 02."  
"那我们就把你从二号机上撤下来。"

Asuka flinched at that. "Ah damn you Misato. Fine I'll take the damn baka downtown later."  
听到这话，明日香退缩了。"该死的美里。好吧，我晚点会带这个笨蛋去市区的。"

Asuka grabbed Shinji by the collar then and dragged him off to school.  
明日香抓住真嗣的衣领，拽着他向学校走去。

"Will those to ever get along," mused Ritsuko?  
“他们俩能和睦相处吗？”律子若有所思地说。

"Not in this lifetime," said Misato.  
“这一生是不可能了，”美里说。

---

School had become something of a hell for Shinji. All the guys in the class still hated him and were still jealous that he and Asuka walked to school together every morning. Though he wasn't sure why all the girls hated him also. Maybe it had something to do with them being jealous of Asuka.  
学校对真嗣来说已经成了某种地狱。班上的男生们依然恨他，依然嫉妒他和明日香每天早上一起上学。虽然他不明白为什么女生们也恨他。也许是因为她们嫉妒明日香。

"Hey," said Asuka as they walked into class. "You did pack our own lunches and not the ones that Misato gave you."  
“嘿，”明日香走进教室时说道，“你带的是我们自己准备的午餐，不是美里给你的那些吧。”

"Hai," said Shinji as he handed her hers.  
“嗯，”真嗣说着递给她自己的那份。

She took it without another look at him and sat down at her desk. Shinji sighed and followed her and sat in his desk behind her.  
她接过东西，没再瞧他一眼，便坐回了自己的桌前。真嗣叹了口气，跟着她走过去，坐在她身后的座位上。

"Look how smug that bastard is about sitting close to Asuka."  
看看那混蛋坐在明日香旁边得意的样儿。

Shinji heard this and moved his eyes slightly to the left to see the boys who's names he didn't know were talking about him.  
真嗣听到这话，微微向左移动视线，看到了那些他不知道名字的男生正在议论他。

Immediately a rush of images hit him pertaining to the boy. Shinji found himself watching the boy walking into some magazine store and browsing some of the more explicit ones. Next second he was watching the person showering. What disgusted Shinji the most he was masturbating and screaming Asuka's name at the same time. 'What the fuck is this,' thought Shinji. 'Why am I thinking this...or I'm I somehow seeing what this guy does.'  
霎时间，一连串关于那男孩的画面涌入他的脑海。真嗣发现自己正看着那男孩走进一家杂志店，翻阅着一些更为露骨的杂志。下一秒，他看到那人在洗澡。最让真嗣恶心的是，那人一边自慰一边尖叫着明日香的名字。'这他妈是怎么回事，'真嗣心想。'为什么我会想到这些...还是我不知怎么地看到了这家伙的行为？'

Reality came back and Shinji found himself starring at the blackboard which the teacher had started scribbling on.  
现实回归，真嗣发现自己正盯着黑板，老师已经开始在上面涂写。

'C'mon to think of it,' thought Shinji. 'It seems...familiar somehow.' Then he thought of the corpse like Asuka in his mind, her right eyeball running free of its socket. How the ends of her fingers looked like they had been chewed off, leaving the bone.  
'来想想看，'真嗣心想。'这似乎...有些熟悉。'然后他想起了脑海中明日香那具尸体般的模样，她的右眼球脱离了眼眶。她的指尖像是被啃食过，只剩下骨头。

'NOOOO THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.'  
'不！那不可能发生。'

'But it will unless you stop it,' said Asuka.  
'但如果你不阻止，它就会发生，'明日香说。

'GOD DAMNIT, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS IS.'  
'该死，我甚至不知道这是什么。'

"Hey baka." Shinji felt something rather hard slap him across the side of his face. He was pulled out of the nightmare to see Asuka frowning at him. "What," he said rather snappishly. Asuka simply pointed to the front of the room.  
"嘿，笨蛋。" 真嗣感到有什么硬物猛地打在了他的脸颊上。他从噩梦中惊醒，看到明日香正皱着眉头盯着他。"怎么了，" 他有些不耐烦地说。明日香只是指了指房间的前方。

"Shinji Ikari are you here."  
"碇真嗣，你在这里吗？"

"Ha-hai," Shinji felt his voice working overtime just to get the words out.  
"哈-哈伊，" 真嗣觉得自己的声音几乎要超负荷才能说出话来。

The teacher frowned at him and went back to his lecture.  
老师皱着眉头看了他一眼，又继续讲课了。

---

During lunch Shinji was leaning against the railing on the school roof thinking of what had happened to him during the morning. It seemed so realistic, whatever it was, and disturbing. The thing about Asuka still scared him though. He had thought that he had prevented it from happening but it looked like she could still die.  
午餐时，真嗣靠在学校屋顶的栏杆上，回想着上午发生在他身上的事情。那一切似乎如此真实，且令人不安。关于明日香的事依然让他感到恐惧。他本以为自己已经阻止了那件事的发生，但看起来她仍有可能死去。

'Damn it, what is happening to me. Am I some kind of psychic.' Really he wouldn't have put it past his own father to experiment on his newborn body.  
'该死，我到底是怎么了。难道我是什么心灵感应者吗？' 说真的，他不会怀疑自己的父亲在他刚出生时就在他身上做实验。

Suddenly he heard the door slamming open and saw that Asuka was striding over to him with a look of pure fury on her face. 'Great,' thought Shinji. 'What did I do this time?'  
突然，他听到门砰地一声被撞开，只见明日香怒气冲冲地朝他走来。'真棒，'真嗣心想。'这次我又做了什么？'

As she got closer he closed his eyes waiting for the hit to come, but it never did. Instead Asuka leaned up against the railing and threw her arms over the side. With that done she opened her mouth and screamed at the top of her voice. The sound echoed all across the academy grounds and Shinji had to cover his ears since she was next to him.  
当她走近时，他闭上眼睛等待着那一拳的到来，但它始终没有落下。相反，明日香靠在栏杆上，双臂搭在栏杆外。做完这些后，她张开嘴，用尽全力尖叫起来。声音在整个学院的场地上回荡，真嗣不得不捂住耳朵，因为她就在他旁边。

"What the hell was that about," asked Shinji?  
“这到底是怎么回事？”真嗣问道。

Asuka threw him a scowl before saying, "This school is a pain in the ass. I can think of a hundred things I could be doing right now. Plus all these perverted guys are starting to get on my nerves. A few actually tried to grope me."  
明日香瞪了他一眼，然后说道：“这学校真是烦死人了。我现在能想到一百件我想做的事。而且这些色狼越来越让我受不了。有几个居然还想摸我。”

Shinji had to suppress a laugh, "So what happened to them?"  
真嗣强忍住笑，问道：“那他们后来怎么样了？”

"One of them has his fingers shoved up the drinking fountain faucet. While the other one actually tried to ambush me in the girls bathroom. He's got his head stuck half way down a toilet now."  
“其中一个手指被塞进了饮水机的出水口。另一个居然在女厕所埋伏我，现在他的头卡在马桶里一半。”

Shinji did laugh this time. It was a relief to have her anger directed at someone else for a change.  
这次真嗣笑了。她的怒火能转向别人，这让他松了一口气。

"So what was wrong with you earlier this morning?"  
“那你今天早上怎么了？”

Shinji's smile dropped when he heard her question. "Nothing," he said simply.  
听到她的问题，真嗣的笑容消失了。“没什么，”他简单地回答。

"Don't give my that crap. You were starring off into nothing. What are you some kind psychopath."  
"别跟我扯这些废话。你刚才明显在发呆。你是不是有什么心理问题啊。"

Shinji didn't want to have to listen to her bitching at a time like this and ignored her  
真嗣不想在这种时候还得听她唠叨，于是选择了无视她

Then the two of them heard voices coming up the stairs.  
接着，两人听到楼梯上传来声音。

"So you got the pictures right?"  
"所以你拍到了那些照片，对吧？"

"Yeah she was getting a drink at the fountain and I stuck my camera under her skirt a little and got a shot of it."  
"对，她正在喷泉边取水喝，我稍微把相机伸到她裙子下面，拍到了一张。"

"And...what color." "然后呢...是什么颜色的？"

"White unfortunately." "真可惜，是白色的。"

"Even so half the guys in the school will want a copy of it. We should sell it for five dollars a picture...what do you think."  
"即便如此，学校里一半的男生都会想要一份。我们应该每张照片卖五美元...你觉得呢？"

"Sounds fair enough, though we'll want to keep this low. If she finds out what were doing she'll kill us. I've heard she messed some guys up pretty bad for trying to grope her."  
"听起来挺合理的，不过我们得低调行事。如果她发现我们在做什么，她会杀了我们的。我听说她对那些试图非礼她的家伙下手很重。"

"But its not like we'll be walking down the hallways with signs saying, COME GET A PICTURE OF ASUKA'S UNDERWEAR FIVE DOLLARS A PICTURE."  
“但也不至于我们会在走廊里举着牌子说，‘来拍明日香的内裤照吧，五美元一张’。”

"No I guess not." “我想应该不会。”

The two of them continued laughing as they walked up the stairs to the roof. When they got over the last landing they froze when they saw Asuka and Shinji starring back at them. Shinji seemed somewhat amused, knowing what was gonna happen. Asuka however was starring back at Kensuke and Touji with a death grin on her face.  
两人继续笑着走上通往屋顶的楼梯。当他们跨过最后一级台阶时，看到明日香和真嗣正盯着他们，顿时僵住了。真嗣似乎有些幸灾乐祸，知道接下来会发生什么。而明日香则带着一副死亡微笑，盯着健介和斗志。

Kensuke realized only to late that any hope of making money was just destroyed.  
剑介意识到得太晚了，任何赚钱的希望刚刚都被摧毁了。

"Oh boys," said Asuka sweetly. "I think you have something that I need to look at."  
“哦，男孩们，”明日香甜甜地说道，“我想你们有些东西我需要看看。”

Kensuke and Touji turned around to make a run for it but Asuka grabbed the back of their shirts and held onto them tight.  
剑介和冬二转身想逃跑，但明日香抓住了他们衬衫的后摆，紧紧地拽住。

"So were is it," she asked again in that sweet honey voice. It sent a chill down Shinji's spine. He hoped to never piss her off enough to make her use that voice.  
“那么，它在哪儿？”她再次用那甜美如蜜的声音问道。这声音让真嗣脊背发凉。他希望永远不要惹她生气到使用这种声音的地步。

Kensuke whimpered and held up the camera.  
剑介呜咽着举起了相机。

Asuka took it without question, and took out the tape. She tossed it at Shinji who caught it rather surprised that she would let him hold it. Trying not to think about what was on it Shinji pocketed it for now.  
明日香毫不犹豫地接过相机，取出了里面的磁带。她将磁带扔给真嗣，真嗣有些惊讶她会让他拿着，尽量不去想里面是什么内容，真嗣暂时把它放进了口袋。

Asuka now looked at the two of them nastily. "Right you two know what you've done and your reward is this."  
明日香此刻恶狠狠地盯着他们俩。“你们俩知道自己干了什么，这就是你们的下场。”

She kicked both of them in the balls sending them to their knees. Shinji had to turn away so as not to here the low grunting. It was something he would rather not experience. Just watching it was bad enough.  
她一脚踢向两人的裆部，让他们跪倒在地。真嗣不得不转过头去，以免听到那低沉的呻吟。这是他宁愿不去体验的。光是看着就已经够糟糕了。

Asuka now walked over to Shinji and held out her hand. He obediently took the tape out of his pocket and handed it to her. She put it back in and walked over to the railing of the school and dropped the camera off the school roof where it fell five stories and shattered upon contact with the ground. Shinji looked over and saw that the tape had broken apart and tape reel was strewn over the ground.  
明日香走到真嗣面前，伸出手。他顺从地从口袋里拿出录像带递给她。她将录像带放回相机，走到学校的栏杆旁，将相机从屋顶扔下，五层楼的高度让它落地时摔得粉碎。真嗣望过去，看到录像带已经断裂，磁带卷散落一地。

He suddenly felt Asuka grab his arm and said, "Fuck this. I'm done with school for today. Lets go home."  
他突然感觉到明日香抓住了他的手臂，说道：“去他妈的。我今天不想上学了。我们回家吧。”

Shinji wasn't able to do anything but nod.  
真嗣除了点头什么也做不了。

---

Being back home though was boring. Asuka immediately grabbed a soda and a bag of chips and sat down to watch T.V. for the rest of the day. Shinji sat with her for a while but eventually got annoyed with trying to understand what she was watching, it was in German.  
然而回到家后却很无聊。明日香立刻抓起一罐汽水和一袋薯片，坐下来准备看一整天的电视。真嗣和她一起坐了一会儿，但最终因为试图理解她在看什么而感到烦躁，那节目是德语的。

So Shinji went to his room and flopped down on his futon and tried to take a nap, but every time he closed his eyes that unbidden image of a rotting Asuka floated into his mind again. It was starting to get on his nerves now. How was he supposed to know when to stop her from dying? Its not like he could follow her everywhere she went, and she certainly wouldn't allow it anyway  
于是真嗣回到自己的房间，扑倒在榻榻米上试图小睡一会儿，但每次他闭上眼睛，那幅不由自主的腐烂明日香影像就会再次浮现在脑海中。这已经开始让他感到烦躁了。他怎么知道何时该阻止她死去？他不可能随时随地跟着她，而且她肯定也不会允许的。

In his feigned sleep he heard somebody open the door. Knowing it was Asuka he pretended to ignore her but was unable to when she kicked him in the side.  
在他假装睡觉时，他听到有人打开了门。知道是明日香，他假装不理会，但当她踢了他侧身一脚时，他无法再装下去。

"Get up baka, were going out."  
“起来，笨蛋，我们要出去。”

Shinji rolled over and was surprised to see Asuka standing their fully dressed. She was wearing a tight, red, sleeveless shirt that failed to hide a slight cleavage, and a dark tight blue pair of jeans. Shinji also saw that she had sun glasses on her head and that she was also wearing sandals.  
真嗣翻身一看，惊讶地发现明日香已经穿戴整齐地站在那里。她穿着一件紧身的红色无袖上衣，隐约露出一点乳沟，下身是一条深蓝色的紧身牛仔裤。真嗣还注意到她头上戴着太阳镜，脚上穿着凉鞋。

"C'mon baka, Misato wanted me to take you shopping so thats what I'm gonna do. Anything is better then just sitting on the couch and getting fat. Besides I need some new clothes too so thats the only reason that I'm doing this," she added.  
“快点，笨蛋，美里让我带你去购物，所以我就得这么做。总比整天坐在沙发上发胖强。再说了，我也需要买些新衣服，这是我唯一愿意做这件事的原因。”她补充道。

Shinji was surprised but nodded and turned to the bathroom to start changing.  
真嗣虽然惊讶，但还是点了点头，转身去浴室开始换衣服。

Several minutes later Shinji came out wearing blue jeans with a white short sleeve shirt, his favorite.  
几分钟后，真嗣穿着他最喜欢的蓝色牛仔裤和白色短袖衬衫走了出来。

Asuka looked him up and down, sighed and said, 'You really have no sense of fashion do you."  
明日香上下打量了他一番，叹了口气说：“你真是毫无时尚感，对吧。”

Shinji raised and eyebrow and walked past her to put his shoes on.  
真嗣挑了挑眉毛，从她身边走过去穿鞋。

'Coward,' thought Asuka before she followed him out the door.  
'胆小鬼，' 明日香在心里想着，随后跟着他走出了门。

---

They were in a part of Tokyo-3 which Shinji had hardly ever walked in. Asuka seemed to know her way around though fairly well.  
他们来到了东京-3 的一个区域，真嗣几乎从未涉足过。但明日香似乎对这里相当熟悉。

Soon though Shinji was wishing he hadn't let her drag him out there. The first store she dragged him into was nothing women's undergarments. Shinji had a feeling that Asuka was making him nervous on purpose. While she browsed around Shinji tried not to focus on one thing to long. He was starting to sweat and he saw that several other girls were looking at him and giggling rather loudly. Either Asuka saw this or not she didn't say.  
很快，真嗣就后悔让她把自己拖到这里来了。她拉他进的第一家店就是卖女性内衣的。真嗣有种感觉，明日香是故意让他紧张的。她在店里逛来逛去，真嗣尽量不去长时间关注某一样东西。他开始出汗，注意到有几个女孩正看着他，大声地偷笑。不管明日香有没有注意到这一点，她都没有说什么。

Asuka turned around then and held up a red bra. Showing it to Shinji who was determinedly looking the other way she said, "Well, what do you think baka. I think it would go rather well with my hair, and of course I'll have to buy matching underwear to go with it."  
明日香转过身来，举起一件红色胸罩。她向坚决不看向她的真嗣展示着，说道：“好吧，你觉得怎么样，笨蛋。我觉得它和我的头发很配，当然我还得买配套的内衣来搭配它。”

"Do you want my honest opinion," said Shinji who now had his back to her.  
“你想听我的真实意见吗？”真嗣背对着她说道。

"That is why I'm asking you, baka."  
“所以我才问你，笨蛋。”

Shinji took a deep breath hoping that he wouldn't regret his words and said, "That looks like something that a stripper would wear."  
真嗣深吸了一口气，希望自己不会后悔说出这些话，然后说道：“那看起来像是脱衣舞娘会穿的。”

Asuka was rather shocked that he had the nerve to say that. Though she was also glad that for once he had spoken his mind. In truth she had showed him it just to see what he would say. She hadn't really considered buying it in the first place. Smirking at his back she said, "Yeah I guess your right."  
明日香相当震惊他居然有胆量这么说。不过她也感到高兴，因为这次他终于说出了心里话。实际上，她给他看那件衣服只是想看看他会怎么反应，并没有真的考虑要买。她对着他的背影微微一笑，说道：“是啊，我想你说的没错。”

Shinji was surprised that she actually valued his opinion. "So are we done here?"  
真嗣惊讶于她竟然真的重视他的意见。“那我们这里的事就算完了？”

"Course not. I've got something that I seriously want to look at."  
“当然不是。我有件非常想看的东西。”

Asuka now grabbed Shinji's arm and steered him over to the swimsuit part of the store. For the next half an hour Asuka sorted through many different choices asking Shinji's opinion on some of them. Shinji who thought of how she would look every time she held a pair up simply shrugged and shook his head.  
现在，明日香抓住了真嗣的手臂，把他带到商店的泳装区。接下来的半小时里，明日香翻阅了许多不同的选择，不时询问真嗣的意见。每次她拿起一件泳装时，真嗣只是耸耸肩，摇摇头，心里想着她穿上会是什么样子。

"A lot of help your being," said Asuka.  
“你可真帮不上忙，”明日香说道。

"Is this something that most guys are supposed to know about?"  
"这是大多数男生都应该知道的事情吗？"

Asuka ignored him and went to the changing room to try on what she just picked out.  
明日香没理他，径直走向更衣室去试穿她刚挑中的衣服。

Shinji was leaning against the wall when Asuka step up to him and said, "Well, what do you think."  
真嗣靠在墙上，明日香走到他面前问道：“怎么样，你觉得呢？”

Shinji had to control his hormones correctly for this one. She had just put on a two piece red bathing suit that had a white strip going along the middle of the top. Shinji blinked and turned away so that he wouldn't be starring so much.  
真嗣这次得好好控制自己的荷尔蒙。她刚穿上一件红色两件式泳衣，上衣中间有一条白色条纹。真嗣眨了眨眼，转过身去，以免盯着她看太久。

"Ah fuck you Shinji, your no help." Asuka turned around to go back in and change out of it when Shinji spoke up, "I think you should get that."  
“啊，去你的，真嗣，你一点忙都帮不上。” 明日香转身准备回去换掉泳衣，这时真嗣开口了，“我觉得你应该买这件。”

Asuka turned around to see him determinedly looking the other way. "Your just saying that so we can leave, aren't you."  
明日香转过身来，看到他坚决地看着别处。“你只是这么说，好让我们能离开，对吧。”

Shinji didn't want to let up on how good he thought it looked on her. He was unwilling starting to get stiff and didn't want her to notice. "No, I think...that the red goes well with your hair."  
真嗣不想放弃他认为这衣服在她身上很好看的想法。他开始感到僵硬，不想让她注意到。“不，我觉得……红色和你的头发很配。”

Asuka raised an eyebrow at him and said, "Hmph whether you think it looks good or not I was planning on buying it anyway." Asuka walked past him but paused and smirked, "By the way try not to be so noticeable next time. I can tell you were starring at my chest."  
明日香对他挑了挑眉，说道：“哼，不管你觉得好不好看，反正我本来就打算买这件。”明日香从他身边走过，但停下脚步，微微一笑，“顺便说一句，下次尽量不要这么显眼。我能看出你一直在盯着我的胸部。”

She walked past him to change into her normal clothes leaving him to gape back at her. 'Damn her,' he thought. 'She just loves to aggravate me.'  
她从他身边走过，去换上平常的衣服，留下他目瞪口呆地看着她。‘该死，’他想，‘她就喜欢惹我生气。’

---

Predictably Shinji was stuck carrying the stuff that she had picked out. Now Asuka was looking around at the shops trying to decide what place would be best to get Shinji some new clothes.  
不出所料，真嗣正扛着她挑选的东西。现在，明日香正环顾四周的商店，试图决定哪一家最适合给真嗣买些新衣服。

Shinji was getting bored though and didn't particularly care whether he got new clothes or not. It's not like anyone was going to notice a change if he did dress a little differently.  
然而，真嗣开始感到无聊，并不特别在意是否要买新衣服。就算他穿得有些不同，也不会有人注意到这种变化。

"Hey, Asuka." “嘿，明日香。”

"Hmm." "嗯。"

"Lets skip this. I don't care whether I get new clothes or not."  
"跳过这个吧。我不在乎是否得到新衣服。"

"Misato ordered me to get you some, so I don't have a choice."  
"美里让我给你买一些，所以我别无选择。"

"But I'm saying that I don't care. It was bad enough being stuck in that...last store."  
"但我的意思是，我不在乎。被困在那个...上一家店里已经够糟糕的了。"

Asuka turned to him now and a grin appeared on her face. "Good because I wasn't taking this seriously anyway. I just wanted you with me so that I didn't have to carry my bags. Though make sure you tell Misato that I took you but you changed your mind. I don't want to get chewed out by her."  
明日香转过身来，脸上露出了笑容。"太好了，反正我也没认真对待。我只是想让你陪我，这样我就不用自己拎包了。不过记得告诉美里是我带你去的，但你改变了主意。我不想被她骂。"

"Hai, I will." "好的，我会说的。"

"Good, then lets go home. My feet are getting sore from all this walking anyway."  
“好，那我们回家吧。我的脚已经走得酸痛了。”

---

Soon the sun had started to set and rush hour was just starting. Shinji was walking a few paces behind Asuka and for some reason couldn't shake a worried feeling that he had all the sudden. 'What is this,' he thought as he looked around at the traffic rushing by him. 'Why do I have a sickening feeling as though something is going to happ-'  
不久，太阳开始西沉，高峰时段刚刚开始。真嗣跟在明日香后面几步远，不知为何突然感到一阵莫名的担忧。'这是怎么了，'他环顾四周疾驰而过的车流，心中思索，'为什么我会突然有种不祥的预感，仿佛即将发生什么——'

---

Shinji felt reality slip away from him. He was now above the street that he had just been walking on and looking down at the cars and pedestrians walking along. 'Why does this seem so...familiar? I don't think I've ever been to this side of Tokyo-3 before. Yet I can't shake this feeling that something is going to happen.'  
真嗣感到现实从他身边滑走。他现在正悬浮在刚刚走过的街道上方，俯视着下方的车辆和行人。'为什么这一切看起来如此……熟悉？我不记得曾来过第三新东京市的这一带。然而，我无法摆脱那种即将发生什么的感觉。'

At his thoughts he saw somebody stumble into the road. Next second the person was hit in the side from an oncoming truck and was dragged under. Even though Shinji couldn't see what was happening from his vantage point he could see that it was a gruesome scene. The person had been spit back out from under the truck and was now lying helpless in the road. Blood was seeping out onto the road where the person laid and Shinji could see unmistakable signs of body tissue. Even though he told himself it was all a dream he still felt like puking.  
他正想着，突然看到有人踉跄地闯入马路。下一秒，那人被迎面而来的卡车侧面撞击，拖入了车底。尽管真嗣从他的位置无法看清发生了什么，但他能看出那是一幕惨状。那人被卡车甩了出来，现在无助地躺在路上。血从那人躺着的地方渗出，真嗣能清楚地看到人体组织的痕迹。尽管他告诉自己这一切都是梦，他仍然感到想吐。

"Do you see what has happened," said a quite voice behind him.  
“你看到了发生的事，”一个平静的声音在他身后说道。

He turned around in mid air to see the Asuka from his dreams. Even though she was still missing half her face she was at least standing up now and not laying in a pool of her own blood.  
他在半空中转过身，看到了梦中的那个明日香。尽管她仍缺了半张脸，但至少现在站起来了，不再躺在自己的血泊中。

"What are you doing here," Shinji asked?  
"你在这里做什么？" 真嗣问道。

"Simple, watching what just occurred."  
"简单，观察刚刚发生的事情。"

"What do you mea-" "你是什么意——"

Next second Shinji found himself next to the body of the person who had just been dragged under the car. Shinji now felt his lungs collapse inside of him. Asuka was lying face up on the pavement with a blank, dead look in her eyes. Just like the one standing next to him this one had the side of her face torn off and an eye ball was hanging loosely over the side. Shinji now guessed what had happened to her fingers and saw that the skin had been shredded off thanks to the tires of the car.  
下一秒，真嗣发现自己站在刚刚被拖到车下的人旁边。真嗣此刻感到自己的肺仿佛在体内崩塌。明日香仰面躺在人行道上，眼中毫无生气，死寂一片。就像站在他身边的这个一样，她的半边脸被撕裂，眼球松松地挂在一边。真嗣现在猜到了她的手指发生了什么，看到皮肤被车轮撕碎。

Shinji continued to stare back into the eyes of the now dead Asuka. It was amazing how red her hair was now with half her skull missing. Shinji now saw that his physical self had rushed over, horror struck and was now weeping over her lifeless body.  
真嗣继续凝视着已经死去的明日香的双眼。她的头发在失去半个头骨后依然红得惊人。真嗣看到自己的身体冲了过来，惊恐万分，现在正对着她毫无生气的身体哭泣。

"Is this what you want," asked the Asuka next to him.  
“这就是你想要的吗？”他身边的明日香问道。

Shinji turned with a saddened look on his face. Looking back down at the corpse before him and said, "This is what will happen if I don't save her."  
真嗣转过身来，脸上带着悲伤的表情。他再次低头看着眼前的尸体，说道：“如果我不救她，这就是将会发生的事。”

The Asuka next to him nodded.  
他身边的明日香点了点头。

Shinji felt like he was about to break down from the sheer stress of what was happening to him. "What are these...these, visions? Why is this happening to me of all people?"  
真嗣感到自己快要被这突如其来的压力击垮了。“这些……这些，幻象是什么？为什么偏偏是我要经历这些？”

"I can't answer that," said Asuka. "I'm merely here to help you along in the beginning. What you decide to do afterward is your decision. Though I will say this. Your decision affects the lives of people around you. Whether this is a gift or a curse is entirely up to you. You can simply ignore what can happen, or what will happen."  
"我无法回答这个问题，" 明日香说，"我只是在这里帮助你起步。之后你决定做什么，是你自己的选择。不过我要提醒你，你的决定会影响到你周围人的生活。这是福是祸，全在于你。你可以选择忽视可能发生或将会发生的事情。"

"Are you suggesting that I'm able to see the future."  
"你是说我有预见未来的能力吗？"

"That seems to be the case. I don't know much about it myself. Though it seems that you are able to see the future of people who are close to you. You can't look into any random person's future and alter it to your desire."  
"看起来似乎是这样。我自己对此了解不多。不过似乎你能预见到与你亲近之人的未来。你无法随意窥探任何人的未来并按你的意愿改变它。"

Shinji was silent for a while before he sat down on the curb. Putting his hand up to his face he touched it gently and then lowered it to the now dead Asuka. "Is this what can happen or what will happen if I don't stop it."  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，然后坐在路缘上。他把手举到脸上，轻轻触碰，随后放到了已经死去的明日香身上。“这是可能发生的事，还是如果我不阻止就会发生的事。”

"Altering the future can be both dangerous for the person altering it and the person that is being altered by it. It is entirely up to you whether you do it or not."  
“改变未来对改变者和被改变者都可能很危险。是否这么做完全取决于你。”

"What is your suggestion?"  
“你有什么建议？”

"It doesn't matter to me either way. I have already died thanks to you. But it was planned that way also. This is simply an alternate reality that in which you chose to ignore the visions and continue on with your life. I'll admit that the end result wasn't pretty. You blamed yourself for killing me and in turn killed yourself. Humans can be rather pathetic."  
"对我来说都无所谓。我已经因为你而死了。但这也在计划之中。这只是你选择忽视预知并继续生活的另一个现实。我得承认，结果并不美好。你因害死我而自责，最终也自杀了。人类有时真是可悲。"

Shinji now looked up at the Asuka before him and frowned, "Who are you really."  
真嗣抬头看着眼前的明日香，皱起眉头，"你到底是谁。"

"Hmm well your not as dumb as you look. No I'm not Asuka. I'm simply taking her form so its easier to speak with you. She will have gone on by now."  
"嗯，看来你没看起来那么笨。不，我不是明日香。我只是借用她的形象，这样和你交流更方便。她现在已经离开了。"

Shinji frowned. He had so many things that he wanted to ask this pseudo Asuka but thought it was time to return to his own place.  
真嗣皱了皱眉。他有太多问题想问这个假明日香，但觉得是时候回到自己的地方了。

"How do I get back."  
“我怎么回去？”

The fake Asuka smirked and said, "However you want to."  
假明日香轻蔑地笑了笑，说：“随你高兴。”

---

All this happened in the span of seconds and Shinji continued to walk behind Asuka. 'That was interesting, though I'll save my worries later I need to decide what I want to do.' Though did he really have to think about that. Sure Asuka could be a complete pain to be around when she was in a bitchy mood. But Shinji still liked to be around her. 'I feel so stupid about having second thoughts about this, fuck I'm a coward.'  
这一切在几秒钟内发生，真嗣继续跟在明日香后面走着。'虽然那很有趣，但我还是把担忧留到以后吧，我需要决定自己想做什么。' 不过，他真的需要考虑这个吗？当然，明日香在心情不好时可能会完全是个麻烦。但真嗣仍然喜欢和她在一起。'我对这个有疑虑感到很愚蠢，该死，我真是个懦夫。'

"Hey Shinji come on lets cross here."  
嘿，真嗣，快点，我们在这里过马路吧。

Shinji looked around at where she was pointing. She was pointing to the other side of the street.  
真嗣环顾四周，看向她指的地方。她指的是街的另一边。

"C'mon baka Shinji if we cross here we can skip the next intersection. Besides," she said looking up and down the road, "their aren't any cars coming so this is the perfect chance."  
"来吧，笨蛋真嗣，如果我们从这里穿过去，就可以跳过下一个路口。而且，" 她上下打量着马路，"没有车过来，这是绝佳的机会。"

"Asuka, wait we shouldn't jaywalk."  
"明日香，等等，我们不应该乱穿马路。"

"Oh calm yourself. Your acting like the First Child." Asuka took a step off the curve and down onto the pavement. However the top of her sandal caught the edge of the curve and she stumbled forward before falling down to her knees. She was now in the lane of traffic closest to the curve.  
"哦，冷静点。你表现得像个第一适格者似的。" 明日香迈出一步，从路缘石上踏到人行道上。然而，她的凉鞋顶部勾住了路缘石的边缘，她踉跄着向前扑倒，双膝着地。她现在位于离路缘石最近的行车道上。

"FUCK, NO ASUKA," Shinji screamed.  
"操，不，明日香，" 真嗣尖叫道。

To Shinji's right he heard the roar of an engine. Turning around for a split second he saw a bright blue truck come skidding around the corner of the side street and pull onto the main street.  
在真嗣的右边，他听到了引擎的轰鸣声。转过身来的一瞬间，他看到一辆亮蓝色的卡车从侧街的拐角处滑行过来，驶上了主街。

'GOD FUCKING DAMNIT,' screamed Shinji in his head.  
'该死的，' 真嗣在心里咆哮。

Darting off the sidewalk with the eyes of every bystander on him he dove to Asuka as the truck was getting closer.  
他从人行道上疾驰而出，所有旁观者的目光都集中在他身上，他向着越来越近的卡车冲向明日香。

"ASUKA GOD DAMNIT GET UP," yelled Shinji at her as he grabbed her arm. Asuka however had frozen when she saw the truck, engine blaring, coming to great her.  
“明日香，该死的快起来！”真嗣朝她大喊，抓住她的手臂。然而明日香在看到那辆引擎轰鸣、疾驰而来的卡车时，整个人都僵住了。

"FUCK IT," yelled Shinji. Grabbing her arm he pulled her as hard as he could and practically picked her up, holding onto one of her arms. Summoning strength that he didn't know he had he jumped from the middle of the lane and landed haphazardly onto the edge of the curve. He heard the truck whiz by but knew that if he fell backwards with him holding her the way he was she could likely suffer a serious concussion, or worse.  
“去他的！”真嗣大喊一声，紧紧抓住她的手臂，用尽全力将她拉起，几乎是将她拎了起来，只靠一只手臂支撑。他爆发出自己都不知道的力量，从车道中央一跃而起，狼狈地落在弯道边缘。他听到卡车呼啸而过，但知道如果自己向后倒下，以他现在的姿势抱着她，她很可能会遭受严重的脑震荡，甚至更糟。

Instead he forced himself to lean forward and felt his foot slip off the edge of the side walk and crashed down hard on the side of his face. Almost immediately he heard a low thump as Asuka fell on top of him also.  
相反，他强迫自己向前倾，感觉到脚从人行道边缘滑落，重重地摔在了脸颊一侧。几乎立刻，他就听到一声低沉的撞击声，因为明日香也倒在了他身上。

Shinji felt blood building up inside of his mouth but ignored it. He had something else he had to worry about. Pushing himself up he found Asuka shaking uncontrollably on his chest.  
真嗣感觉到嘴里积聚着血，但他忽略了它。他有其他需要担心的事情。他撑起自己，发现明日香在他胸前颤抖不已。

"Asuka are you-" “明日香，你还好吗-”

But then he was lost for words as she broke down crying on his chest. Mouth wide open in surprise Shinji didn't know what to say in a situation like this. "Asuka," he swallowed, "its okay, everything is fine."  
但随后他便语塞了，因为她在他胸前崩溃大哭。真嗣惊讶得嘴巴大张，不知在这种情况下该说什么。“明日香，”他咽了咽口水，“没事的，一切都好。”

She shook her head and continued to cry even harder. Shinji now looked up and saw many worried faces looking back at him and her.  
她摇了摇头，哭得更厉害了。真嗣抬头望去，看到许多担忧的面孔正回望着他和她。

"Good God that was a fright, are you okay kid," said an elderly gentlemen.  
“天哪，真是吓人一跳，你还好吗，孩子？”一位老先生说道。

Shinji nodded and looked back at Asuka who he realized now had pushed herself off his chest and was starring wide eyed at everyone gathered their.  
真嗣点点头，回头看向明日香，他这时才意识到她已经从他胸前推开，正瞪大眼睛看着聚集在那里的每个人。

"No...no...," she whispered.  
“不……不……”她低声呢喃。

Shinji was worried, "Asuka what are you?" But then he froze when she screamed out loud.  
真嗣担心地问：“明日香，你怎么了？”但随即他僵住了，因为她大声尖叫起来。

"ASUKA!" "明日香！"

She had stood up quickly and had taken off down the sidewalk.  
她迅速站起身，沿着人行道飞奔而去。

"ASUKA WAIT." "明日香，等等。"

Asuka however continued to sprint as fast as she could. 'No...No...NO! I've been poisoned. I let people see my weakness. I can't let them know how weak I truly am. Least of all Shinji. How could I have used him as a sponge to cry my eyes out. I feel dirty. WHY AM I STILL ALIVE.'  
然而，明日香依旧竭尽全力地奔跑着。'不...不...不！我中毒了。我让人看到了我的弱点。我不能让他们知道我有多么脆弱。尤其是真嗣。我怎么能把他当作擦泪的海绵呢。我感觉肮脏。为什么我还活着？'

'Because he saved you,' said a small voice in her head.  
'因为他救了你，'她脑海中有个细小的声音说道。

'I didn't ask him to,' she retorted.  
'我没让他这么做，'她反驳道。

'Yet he did anyway.' '但他还是这么做了。'

'NO I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. I DON'T NEED ANYBODY ELSE.'  
'不，我能照顾好自己。我不需要任何人。'

'Could you have saved yourself if you weren't so afraid.'  
'如果不是因为害怕，你能自救吗？'

'I would rather die then rely on anybody. Least of all that coward.'  
'我宁愿死也不愿依赖任何人。尤其是那个懦夫。'

'Yet he wasn't a coward. He risked his own life to save you.'  
'但他并非懦夫。他冒着生命危险来救你。'

'STOP IT. GET OUT OF MY MIND.'  
'住口。从我脑海中滚出去。'

---

Soon Shinji had lost sight of Asuka and was leaning against a light post breath heavily. While he had ran he discovered that several teeth had been knocked loose and that they were hanging by little more than his gums. The blood was still flowing freely in his mouth and he had to spit every few seconds to keeping the saltiness out of his mouth.  
不久，真嗣便看不见明日香的身影了，他靠在一根路灯杆上，喘着粗气。在奔跑的过程中，他发现自己有几颗牙齿松动了，几乎只是靠牙龈勉强挂着。血仍在嘴里自由流淌，他不得不每隔几秒就吐一口，以保持嘴里没有咸味。

'Damn it Asuka. Why were you so afraid all the sudden?'  
“该死的明日香。你为什么突然这么害怕？”

Shinji soon willed himself to move off of the light post and continued running back to Misato's apartment where he was sure Asuka had gone.  
真嗣很快强迫自己离开路灯杆，继续跑回美里小姐的公寓，他确信明日香已经去了那里。

---

When Shinji opened the door he was glad to notice that her shoes were at least laying there. Though it looked as though she had thrown them across the floor when she had come in.  
当真嗣打开门时，他很高兴至少看到她的鞋子摆在那里。不过看起来她进来时像是把它们扔过地板似的。

He took his own shoes off and walked slowly inside. "Asuka," he said quietly.  
他脱下自己的鞋子，慢慢地走了进去。“明日香，”他轻声说道。

He didn't get a response back and walked inside a little further. Turning toward her door he knocked softly. "Asuka...are you there."  
他没有得到回应，又往里走了几步。转向她的房门，他轻轻地敲了敲。“明日香...你在吗？”

Again he didn't get an answer. Feeling a little worried he opened the door a little and peeked his head in. "Asuka?"  
他又没有得到回答。感到有些担心，他轻轻推开门，探头进去。“明日香？”

He was greeted with something being thrown at him. Though it missed his head it shattered close to it and Shinji felt something sharp scrape the side of his face. He pulled back his head quickly and shut the door as something else shattered against it. 'Damn, why the fuck is she acting like this. I just saved her life didn't I. She could at least show a little gratitude.'  
迎接他的是一个飞来的物体。虽然没砸中他的头，却在附近碎裂，真嗣感到脸颊一侧被什么尖锐的东西划过。他迅速缩回头，关上门，又有什么东西在门上碎裂。“该死，她到底为什么这样发疯。我不是救了她一命吗？她至少可以表现出一点感激之情吧。”

Shinji now walked away but stop dead in his tracks when a fleeting image of Asuka choking herself with some twine appeared in his mind.  
真嗣转身离开，但突然停下脚步，脑海中闪过明日香用细绳勒住自己脖子的画面。

"Its your fault Shinji, I can't let anyone know how weak I am. Least of all you."  
"这都是你的错，真嗣，我不能让任何人知道我有多脆弱。尤其是你。"

Without thinking he turned around and flung open the door to her room. Ignoring the fact that something else was aimed at his head he darted toward where she was, curled up in a corner with something that looked like a stuffed bear in her hands.  
他未经思考便转过身，猛地推开她房间的门。无视着有东西正瞄准他的头部，他冲向她所在的地方，只见她蜷缩在角落里，手里抱着一个看起来像毛绒熊的东西。

"NO DON'T COME NEAR ME," she shrieked as she tried to push herself farther back into the corner  
"不，不要靠近我，""她尖叫着，试图将自己更深地挤进角落里。

Shinji ignored her and looked at her carefully, then swore in his mind. He remembered what the fake Asuka had said about not relying to much on the visions. Sometimes they were only things that could happen, not things that would happen. Relaxing slightly he let out a deep breath and looked at her more closely. It seemed that she had gotten back slightly ahead of him. Her hair was a greasy mess from her sweat and it hung in great bunches around her face. She still had the red shirt and dark blue jeans on, though he saw that certain parts had stains on them.  
真嗣无视了她，仔细地打量着她，然后在心里咒骂了一声。他想起了假明日香关于不要太依赖幻象的忠告。有时候，那些只是可能发生的事情，而不是一定会发生的。他稍微放松了一些，深吸一口气，更仔细地看着她。似乎她已经稍微领先于他了。她的头发因为汗水而变得油腻凌乱，大团地垂在脸颊周围。她仍然穿着那件红色衬衫和深蓝色牛仔裤，尽管他注意到某些部分有污渍。

She still seemed nervous and had an afraid look in her eyes. Shinji wanted to calm her down, to prevent himself from seeing any more horrendous images appearing in his mind. Instead he sat down a few feet in front of her. This was the first time that he had been in her room and he looked around now at it. It was much cleaner than his and he saw that many of the things that she had came from Germany. She had hung several posters on her walls depicting famous artists. Shinji didn't recognized any of them though, he was more into the classics.  
她看起来仍然很紧张，眼中流露出害怕的神情。真嗣想让她平静下来，以免脑海中再出现更多可怕的画面。相反，他在她面前几英尺处坐下。这是他第一次进入她的房间，他现在环顾四周。这里比他的房间干净得多，他看到她的许多东西都来自德国。她在墙上挂了几张著名艺术家的海报。真嗣一个也不认识，他更喜欢古典艺术。

Turning his gaze back to her he saw that she had calmed down slightly but was now giving him a death glare. Truthfully Shinji preferred the hard ass Asuka instead of the frightened one. It didn't suit her.  
他转回视线看向她，发现她已经稍微平静了一些，但此刻正对他投以死亡凝视。说实话，真嗣更喜欢那个强硬的明日香，而不是那个惊慌失措的她。那不适合她。

Feeling that she was doing better he said quietly, "Asuka...are you okay?"  
感觉到她状态有所好转，他轻声问道：“明日香……你还好吗？”

She inhaled deeply and grabbed the nearest pillow and flung it at Shinji's face. Shinji didn't even care. The fact that she had reacted was all that he cared for. "Asuk-"  
她深吸一口气，抓起最近的枕头朝真嗣的脸扔去。真嗣根本不在意。她有所反应的事实才是他在乎的。“明日香——”

But now she tackled him to the floor and was now beating her fists repeatedly on his chest. "Damn you Shinji. Damn you, damn you damn you."  
但她此刻却将他扑倒在地，拳头如雨点般落在他的胸膛。“该死的真嗣。该死的，该死的该死的。”

Shinji continued to look up at her ceiling while she continued to pound his chest. Soon the punches became less frequent and with less power. Then she had seised hitting him and had pushed herself off of him and moved back to the corner.  
真嗣继续仰望着天花板，而她依旧捶打着他的胸口。渐渐地，拳击的频率和力度都减弱了。随后，她停止了击打，从他身上撑起，退回到角落里。

Shinji continue to stare at the wall waiting for her to reply. "Why did you do that?"  
真嗣继续盯着墙壁，等待她的回应。“你为什么要那样做？”

Shinji thought this was the stupidest question in the world. What was he supposed to, just stand there in shock as she died? He didn't think he could take seeing her die for a second time.  
真嗣觉得这是世界上最愚蠢的问题。难道他应该怎么做，就站在那里震惊地看着她死去吗？他觉得他无法承受再次目睹她死去。

"Do you honestly think that I could have watched that happen."  
"你真的认为我能眼睁睁看着那种事情发生吗。"

"But...I always seem to get on your nerves. Why would you risk yourself to protect someone like me?"  
"但是...我总是惹你生气。你为什么要冒着生命危险去保护像我这样的人呢？"

Shinji wasn't about to tell her about his visions. He didn't need her thinking that he was some sort of freak. "Do I need a reason. If I was to stand their and watch it would have been the same as killing you myself. I was able to save you and I took that."  
真嗣并不打算告诉她自己的那些幻觉。他不需要她认为自己是个怪胎。“我需要理由吗？如果我站在那里看着，那和亲手杀了你有什么区别。我救了你，我抓住了那个机会。”

"But I didn't want you to," she almost yelled. "I feel so disgusting...like vomiting. I was held by you GOD DAMNIT. I CRIED INTO YOUR CHEST. I WAS WEAK!"  
“但我并不想让你救我，”她几乎是在喊。“我感觉恶心……想吐。我被你抱住了，该死的。我哭着靠在你胸前。我太软弱了！”

"Is that what this is about? You felt weak. Asuka your one of the strongest people I know. Being able to pilot something like the Eva's is an inhuman task. When I piloted it...for that time, I felt like I was losing my mind. It was so disgusting floating in that damn liquid that smells so much like blood. I kept willing myself not to vomit every time I felt the bile coming up my throat. And you've been doing this full time, how could you call yourself weak. If anything I'm the weak one."  
“这就是问题的关键吗？你觉得软弱。明日香，你是我认识的最坚强的人之一。驾驶像 Eva 这样的东西是非人的任务。当我驾驶它……那段时间，我感觉自己快要疯了。漂浮在那股血腥味浓重的液体里，太恶心了。每次感到胆汁涌上喉咙，我都拼命忍住不吐。而你一直在全职做这件事，你怎么能说自己软弱呢。要说的话，我才是不够坚强的人。”

Asuka was silent. Shinji hadn't talked about his experience inside the Eva since he had been released from the hospital. It was always something that she and Misato knew that he would never talk about freely. "Shinji...do you plan on ever piloting Eva again."  
明日香沉默了。真嗣自从出院后，就再也没有谈及他在 Eva 中的经历。她和美里都知道，他永远不会自由地谈论这些。“真嗣……你打算再次驾驶 Eva 吗？”

Shinji didn't even have to think of that. "No, I can't, not for anything. I don't want to put myself in something as...demonic I guess, ever again."  
真嗣甚至不需要思考这个问题。“不，我做不到，无论如何都不行。我不想再让自己陷入那种……可以说是恶魔般的存在中了。”

"But the Eva's are supposed to be used to save mankind from the Angels."  
“但 Eva 本应被用来拯救人类免受使徒的威胁。”

"Yet what are the Angels. Why do they attack us? What have we done wrong."  
“然而天使是什么？他们为何攻击我们？我们做错了什么？”

Asuka was silent. It was something she never worried about. Though now that he brought it up she wondered also what the purpose of them could be. She knew about the possibilities of Third Impact and that the Angels were trying to initiate it.  
明日香沉默了。这是她从未担心过的问题。不过现在他提起了，她也想知道天使存在的目的。她知道第三次冲击的可能性，以及天使们试图引发它。

Now though she saw that Shinji had moved closer to her and was bending over her legs. Immediately she became defensive and said, "What the fuck are you doing. You better not being try to take a peek up my pant legs, because if you are I'l-"  
然而现在，她看到真嗣向她靠近，弯腰在她腿边。她立刻变得警觉，说道：“你在干什么？你最好不要试图偷看我的裙底，否则我可要——”

"Oh shut it Asuka," said Shinji forcefully.  
"哦，闭嘴吧，明日香，" 真嗣强硬地说道。

Asuka did, though it was because of her surprise. She had hardly heard Shinji snap back at her. Now though she asked in a more polite voice, "What are you doing then baka?"  
明日香确实闭嘴了，但这只是因为她感到惊讶。她几乎没听过真嗣对她反唇相讥。不过现在她用更礼貌的语气问道，"那你到底在干什么，笨蛋？"

"You probably never realized it, but when you fell you scraped your knees." Shinji was looking at her pant legs now and saw that where the knees were was a little damp.  
"你可能从未注意到，但你摔倒时擦伤了膝盖。" 真嗣现在正盯着她的裤腿看，发现膝盖处有点潮湿。

"Asuka can I have you roll up your pant legs to your knees?"  
“明日香，你能把裤腿卷到膝盖上吗？”

She threw him a scowl but complied. "You better not try anything suspicious are you'll be on your stomach gasping for air."  
她瞪了他一眼，但还是照做了。“你最好别动什么歪脑筋，否则你就得趴在地上喘不过气来。”

Shinji ignored her comment and looked down at her knees. The blood had dried in certain areas but was still flowing slightly. "We'll have to staunch this and wrap it up with something."  
真嗣没理会她的警告，低头看着她的膝盖。血在一些地方已经凝固，但仍有轻微流出。“我们得先止血，然后用东西包扎一下。”

"Don't you mean I," said Asuka standing up. "I'm not letting you touch me anymore than you have to hentai."  
"你是指'我'吧，" 明日香站起来说道。"我不会让你再碰我，除非必要，变态。"

Shinji scowled at her but sighed and stood up. "Fine do what ever you want. But clean that soon or it could get infected. Misato might not be coming back for a while so I'm gonna start dinner now."  
真嗣对她皱了皱眉，但还是叹了口气站起来。"好吧，随你便。但尽快清理干净，不然可能会感染。美里可能一时半会儿回不来，我要开始做晚饭了。"

"Fine do whatever you want."  
"好吧，随你便。"

Asuka turned and walked out into the hallway and turned into the bathroom. Poking her head back out she said with a slight grin on her face, "And don't you dare try to catch anything."  
明日香转过身，走出走廊，拐进了浴室。她探出头来，脸上带着一丝狡黠的笑容说：“你可别想抓住什么。”

"As if I would," said Shinji.  
“我才不会呢，”真嗣说。

---

Shinji was standing over the stove now with the pot that was sending steam out. He didn't care what Asuka said, he wanted something Japanese for once instead of constant German food. 'As long as she doesn't have to cook she doesn't care anyway. But really, through all the talking we just did she never thanked me once. Maybe she doesn't have a heart maybe its just a black hole of some sorts.'  
真嗣现在站在炉子旁，锅里的蒸汽不断冒出。他不在乎明日香说什么，他只想吃一次日本料理，而不是一直吃德国菜。‘只要她不用做饭，她才不在乎呢。但说真的，我们刚才聊了那么多，她一次也没谢过我。也许她没有心，也许那只是某种黑洞。’

Shinji now turned off the stove and took the pot with the cooked rice in it. Putting the rice in together with the beef and vegetables he tossed the food together so that the peanut oil he had used mixed with the rice so that it gave it a little more flavor. Stir fry's were some of Shinji's favorite meals.  
真嗣现在关掉了炉子，拿起装着煮熟米饭的锅。他将米饭与牛肉和蔬菜一起翻炒，让之前使用的花生油与米饭混合，增添了一丝风味。炒饭是真嗣最喜欢的菜肴之一。

"Smells like something that isn't Japanese food," said a voice behind.  
“闻起来不像日本料理，”背后传来一个声音。

'Wonder who the hell that could be,' thought Shinji in mock irritation.  
“不知道那会是谁，”真嗣假装恼怒地想。

"Sorry Asuka, I wanted Japanese food today."  
"对不起，明日香，我今天想吃日本料理。"

"Whatever, since it smells good enough I don't care."  
"无所谓，既然闻起来不错，我就不介意了。"

'Figures, she didn't cook it so she doesn't care. Sometimes I wonder how the hell she survived without me there to cook for her.'  
“难怪，她没做所以不在乎。有时候我真好奇，没有我在那儿给她做饭，她是怎么活下来的。”

Turning around Shinji put the pot with everything in it on the table and put two plates on the table.  
转过身，真嗣将装满食材的锅放在桌上，并摆上了两个盘子。

"Itadakimasu," said Shinji.  
“我开动了，”真嗣说道。

Asuka simply dug right in to the food without saying any form of thank you. Shinji sighed and figured he should have been expecting this attitude.  
明日香直接开始吃起了食物，没有说任何感谢的话。真嗣叹了口气，心想自己本该料到她会是这种态度。

"What is this," said Asuka speaking up?  
"这是什么？" 明日香开口问道。

"Its a stir fry," said Shinji.  
"这是一道炒菜，" 真嗣回答道。

"Hmm, its not half bad baka."  
"嗯，还不赖，笨蛋。"

"Err, thanks Asuka." "呃，谢谢明日香。"

Asuka now looked up from her plate and put down her chopsticks.  
明日香现在从她的盘子上抬起头，放下了筷子。

"Um Shinji..." "嗯，真嗣..."

"What?" "什么？"

"I guess...well...thank you..."  
"我想...嗯...谢谢你..."

Shinji continued to look down at his plate. "...Don't mention it."  
真嗣继续低头看着他的盘子。"...不用谢。"

"You...wont mention...that to Misato will you?"  
"你...不会把...这件事告诉美里吧？"

Shinji looked up and saw that she was really worried. 'Why would she be so worried about something so trivial as that. Even me who practically shunned all human contact eventually came to realize that being around people is enjoyable and thats its okay to rely on people to help. But if she doesn't want help thats her choice. I'm not gonna force her to acknowledge anything.'  
真嗣抬头一看，发现她真的很担心。'为什么她会对这么琐碎的事情如此担心呢。就连我这个几乎回避所有人际交往的人，最终也意识到与人相处是愉快的，依靠他人帮助也是没问题的。但如果她不想接受帮助，那是她的选择。我不会强迫她承认任何事情。'

"Yeah, don't worry about it."  
“嗯，别担心。”

Asuka nodded and went back to eating  
明日香点点头，继续吃东西

Later that night Shinji lay awake in bed. Everything had happened to him today was spinning around in his head. "Why do I have this...power I guess you could call it, to see the future of people I know. Is their a reason that I've been given this. What am I supposed to do with this."  
那晚晚些时候，真嗣躺在床上辗转反侧。今天发生的一切在他脑海中盘旋。“为什么我会有这种……可以说是预知未来的能力，看到我所认识的人的未来。这是有什么原因吗？我应该用这个能力做什么。”

"You've got to find that out for yourself baka."  
“你得自己找出答案，笨蛋。”

Shinji sat bolt upright and almost screamed out. The fake Asuka was sitting on the edge of his bed smirking at him. Though Shinji was glad that she seemed to have her face back to the way it was.  
真嗣猛地坐起身，差点尖叫出来。假明日香坐在他床边，正对他冷笑。尽管真嗣很高兴她的脸似乎恢复了原样。

"Err I don't mean to be rude but what are you doing here...do I still call you Asuka or what."  
"呃，我不是有意无礼，但你在这里做什么...我还该叫你明日香吗？"

"You can, though...nah you can wait a little longer. I see that you decided to save her."  
"你可以，不过...算了，你再等一会儿吧。看来你决定救她了。"

"I don't think I couldn't have. I...hmm...it wouldn't have been right."  
"我觉得我不能不救。我...嗯...那样做不对。"

"Thats a rather lame excuse."  
"那真是个蹩脚的借口。"

"Maybe but I can't think of a better one. Just knowing that it would have been my fault would have been enough to drive me mad."  
"或许吧，但我实在想不出更好的理由。光是知道那可能是我的错，就足以让我发疯。"

"You've still got a long way's to go," said the fake Asuka standing up.  
""你还有很长的路要走，""假明日香站起身来说道。

Shinji smirked and said, "You may look like her, and I hate to say it but right down to her chest, but Asuka never would sound so philosophical."  
真嗣微微一笑，说道：“你或许外表像她，甚至胸部都一模一样，但我不得不说，明日香从不会这么哲学。”

"Maybe not, but I only know what she looks like. I haven't been around her enough to know what kind of personality she has. Though I can certainly examine your mind to find out. Would like me to?"  
“也许吧，但我只知道她的样子。我还没和她相处足够久，不了解她的性格。不过，我当然可以探查你的心思来了解。你想让我这么做吗？”

Shinji smiled, "No thats okay. Having one Asuka is enough."  
真嗣笑了笑，“不用了，有这一个明日香就够了。”

"Thats rather rude." "那样说有点不礼貌。"

"No I mean...she's unique, I guess thats the best way I can phrase that."  
"不，我是说……她很独特，我想这是我能想到的最恰当的表述了。"

"Hmph I guess, I can understand that. Well, I'm done here. Time to see what other misfortunate humans I can torture. Though I must say your decision is rather interesting."  
"哼，我想我能理解。好了，我这里结束了。该去看看还有哪些不幸的人类可以折磨了。不过我得说，你的决定相当有趣。"

"How so?" "此话怎讲？"

She simply smirked and said, "Oh you'll find out soon enough."  
她只是微微一笑，说道：“哦，你很快就会知道了。”

He blinked and she was gone which left him to wonder if it was nothing more than a dream or if he had really just talked to...whoever she was.  
他眨了眨眼，她已消失无踪，留下他独自疑惑，这究竟是一场梦，还是他真的与那位——无论她是谁——交谈过。

### Chapter 4: Decide

**...I'M BACk..for now. Sorry bout the wait. In my defense I'll say that its hard to right a story like this and I have to be in a particular mood to get everything across. Anyway I'm hoping to work on this more so expect updates more frequently. (instead of four month's like this time) So for all those people that thought I died or abandoned this I apologize. I never abandon my stories, no matter how long it takes to get them done, I will get them done. And...I'm done  
……我回来了……暂时。抱歉让大家久等了。我得辩解一下，写这样的故事确实很难，我必须得在特定的心情下才能把一切都表达出来。无论如何，我希望今后能更频繁地更新（不像这次隔了四个月）。所以，对于那些以为我死了或者放弃了这个故事的人，我深表歉意。我从不放弃我的故事，无论需要多长时间完成，我都会完成它们。而且……我说完了。**

---

Shinji sat bolt upright on his futon, breathing heavily as though he had just ran a mile. Rubbing his temples wearily he let out a low sigh and tried to remember what he had just dreamt.  
真嗣笔直地坐在他的被褥上，呼吸急促，仿佛刚跑完一英里。他疲惫地揉着太阳穴，发出一声低叹，试图回忆起他刚刚梦见了什么。

Again, he suspected, that it had to do with the random visions that he had been having. Most of them, with the exception of Asuka's, had been completely irrelevant. This one though confused him.  
他再次怀疑，这与他近期频繁出现的幻觉有关。除了关于明日香的那些，大多数幻觉都毫无关联。但这次的幻觉却让他困惑不已。

In it, he was standing in the middle of a large crater, in the center of Tokyo 3. Around him many corpses of people that he had no affiliation with. However in the middle of it all was Eva Unit 01.  
在幻觉中，他站在一个巨大的弹坑中央，位于第三新东京市的中心。周围散布着许多与他无关的人的尸体。然而，在这片混乱的中心，是 Eva 初号机。

Shinji had stood there for a good while before he walked slowly over to what remained of the unit. The entry plug was laying a good few yards away from it and as he slowly approached it he realized that an arm was dangling out of it. Now running towards, it he pried it open as best he could. From what he could see from the small opening that he had made a girl laid inside.  
真嗣在那里站了好一会儿，才慢慢走向残存的初号机。驾驶舱插栓躺在离它几码远的地方，当他缓缓靠近时，他发现有一只手臂从里面垂挂出来。他立刻跑向那里，尽可能地用力打开插栓。从他打开的小缝隙中，他看到一个女孩躺在里面。

At this point Shinji felt nauseous, not necessarily from the fact that another child was forced to fight in the demonic Eva's, but more of the fact that her left side was torn apart, leaving brain matter hanging out of the side of her skull. From what he could see, apart from all the blood, was that she had light blue hair.  
此时，真嗣感到一阵恶心，并非完全因为另一个孩子被迫驾驶恶魔般的 EVA，而是更因为她的左侧被撕裂，脑浆从颅侧溢出。从他所见，除了满地的血迹外，她的头发是淡蓝色的。

Shinji had then put out a hand grab her wrist and see if she had a pulse. At this point the dying pilot had grabbed his hand forcefully and her eyes had flown open, revealing two blood red globes looking back at him. Shinji had attempted to wrench free of her grip but she simply frowned back at him and whispered, "Why did you let everyone die?"  
真嗣随即伸出手去抓她的手腕，想确认她是否有脉搏。就在这时，垂死的驾驶员猛地抓住他的手，双眼突然睁开，露出两颗血红色的眼球盯着他。真嗣试图挣脱她的握力，但她只是皱着眉头，低声问道：“为什么你让大家都死了？”

---

Shinji had then turned shakily around to see everybody that he had ever met, piled in a bloody heap behind him. It was thanks to this last part that he had sat bolt upright in his futon. Seeing Asuka and Misato torn to shreds was not something that he didn't consider pleasant. Then again, who would?  
真嗣随后颤抖着转身，看到他曾遇见的每一个人都堆叠在他身后，血肉模糊。正是这一幕让他猛地从被褥中坐起。看到明日香和美里被撕成碎片，绝非他所认为的愉快景象。再者，谁又能接受这样的场面呢？

Forcing himself to sit up, he trudged to the bathroom, willing himself not to vomit until he reached the toilet. Several minutes later he had his back to the bathroom door as he had just thrown up a large portion of the stir fry that he had made. Grimacing at the taste of bile he looked down at his hands and realized they were shaking.  
他强迫自己坐起来，拖着沉重的步伐走向浴室，心里不断告诉自己要撑到马桶前再吐。几分钟后，他背靠着浴室门，刚刚吐出了大部分自己做的炒菜。他皱着眉头，对胆汁的味道感到厌恶，低头看着自己的手，发现它们在颤抖。

What confused him most about this dream, or vision, was that the blue haired girl with red eyes had never met him, as far as he could remember. He thought that only people that he had met before, or were always around were people that he would have the visions for.  
这个梦，或者说幻象，最让他困惑的是，那个蓝发红眼的女孩，就他所记得的，从未见过他。他原以为只有那些他之前见过或经常在身边的人，才会出现在他的幻象中。

Leaning his head back against he bathroom door he banged it lightly against it. 'I'm really going insane, aren't I?' He paused, as he fully expected someone to answer him. Without any kind of confirmation to his sanity he open the bathroom door and walked slowly back to his futon, where he immediately fell down and fell asleep.  
他后仰着头靠在浴室门上，轻轻地敲了敲门。'我真的要疯了，不是吗？'他停顿了一下，满心期待有人会回答他。在没有得到任何关于他理智的确认后，他打开浴室门，慢慢走回自己的蒲团，立刻倒下并睡着了。

Shinji walked slowly into the kitchen the next morning already to find Asuka and Misato sitting there, chatting animately. Though when Shinji walked in Asuka frowned at him for a minute before turning back towards Misato.  
第二天早上，真嗣缓缓走进厨房，发现明日香和美里已经坐在那里，正热烈地聊着。然而，当真嗣走进来时，明日香皱着眉头看了他一会儿，然后又转向美里。

In truth Shinji didn't feel that good. Even though he had fallen asleep instantly last night after his dream, he had a splitting headache this morning. Misato therefore realized this, as she watched Shinji try to put the cereal back in the fridge.  
实际上，真嗣感觉并不好。尽管昨晚他一躺下就立刻睡着了，但今早醒来却头痛欲裂。美里注意到了这一点，因为她看到真嗣试图把麦片放回冰箱。

"Err Shinji, are you okay?"  
“呃，真嗣，你还好吗？”

"Yeah, I'm fine, just a little tired is all."  
"嗯，我没事，只是有点累而已。"

Misato frowned at him and said, "No your not, you've got bags under your eyes as if you didn't sleep last night." Standing up she walked over to Shinji and put a hand to his forehead. "You've got a fever, Shinji."  
美里皱着眉头对他说：“不，你看起来可不像没事，你眼睛下面都有黑眼圈了，好像昨晚没睡一样。”她站起来走到真嗣身边，把手放在他的额头上。“你发烧了，真嗣。”

"Well, I suppose that explains why I feel like shit," murmured Shinji. Sighing he sat down at the table then and rested his head on the table.  
"好吧，我想这解释了为什么我感觉这么糟糕，“真嗣低声说。叹了口气，他坐到桌边，把头靠在桌子上。

"Shinji your gonna stay home from school."  
"真嗣，你今天不用去学校了。"

Shinji smirked, 'Fantastic.'  
真嗣微微一笑，'太棒了。'

"And Asuka will stay and take care of you," she finished.  
"明日香会留下来照顾你，"她补充道。"

'Not fantastic,' Shinji corrected. Thankfully that didn't seem to be the case, as Asuka stood up quickly and threw Shinji a scowl. Picking up her plate she dumped it in the sink, turned around and walked towards the front door.  
“不算太好，”真嗣纠正道。幸好这似乎不是实情，因为明日香迅速站起身，向真嗣投去一个怒视。她拿起自己的盘子，扔进水槽，转身走向前门。

"Asuka-" Asuka walked outside and slammed the door, "-wait." Misato stood there for a minute with an annoyed look on her face but started slightly as she felt a hand on her shoulder.  
“明日香——”明日香走出屋外，砰地一声关上门，“——等等。”美里站在那里，脸上带着恼怒的表情，但随即微微一惊，感到有人搭上了她的肩膀。

"Don't worry about it, Misato. I've taken care of myself my entire life so one day isn't going to make a difference. Besides I think I'd get worse if Asuka took care of me. Probably poison me or something."  
“别担心，美里。我一生都是自己照顾自己，一天不会有什么差别的。再说，如果让明日香来照顾我，我可能会更惨。说不定会给我下毒什么的。”

"She may dislike you but thats going far even for her."  
"她可能不喜欢你，但这也太过分了，连她都不会这么做。"

Shinji thought that it was a lot more than just dislike but didn't feel like saying anything.  
真嗣认为这不仅仅是讨厌，但他不想说什么。

"Well, Shinji, if you think that you'll be fine on your own that I guess that I'll try not to worry. I'd stay home myself but I've got to work at Nerv."  
"好吧，真嗣，如果你觉得自己一个人没问题，那我想我尽量不担心。我本来想待在家里，但我得去 NERV 工作。"

"Thanks, Misato." "谢谢你，美里。"

Misato smiled then and patted Shinji gently on the shoulder and then walked out the door.  
美里随即微笑着，轻轻拍了拍真嗣的肩膀，然后走出了房门。

Shinji would have gladly liked to tell her how much it ment to him that she had considered staying home with him but found that something was stuck in his throat. Wheeling around he decided that the best course of action was to try and force himself to get some sleep.  
真嗣本想告诉她，她考虑留在家陪他对他来说意义重大，却发现喉咙里像是哽住了什么。他转过身，决定最好的办法是强迫自己试着入睡。

---

At school, Asuka was bored to the limit. Everything that the teacher was talking about she had already learned. Several times she had turned around to make some comment about the stupidity of the teacher, only to remember that Shinji was at home sick.  
在学校，明日香无聊到了极点。老师讲的那些内容她早已学过。她几次转过身来，想对老师的愚蠢发表些评论，却突然记起真嗣因病在家。

'Tch, probably forced himself to throw up so he could skip school. Sick fuck,' she thought with a grimace. Even so without him here she was bored. At least he wasn't like all the other boys in the class, who seemed to get disgusting thoughts every time she walked in front of them. Though she was torn away from her thoughts to find a very disgusting reality awaiting him.  
“切，八成是自己逼着吐了，好逃学。病态的家伙，”她皱着眉头想。即便如此，没有他在，她还是感到无聊。至少他不像班上其他男生那样，每次她从他们面前走过时，似乎都会产生恶心的念头。尽管她的思绪被拉回，发现一个非常恶心的现实在等着他。

"Oh yes," yes said the teacher as he saw the door opening. "I had forgotten that you would be returning today."  
“哦，是的，”老师看到门打开时说道，“我忘了你今天会回来。”

Asuka narrowed her eyes to those of a hawk as she saw the light blue haired girl with red eyes walk in.  
明日香眯起眼睛，锐利如鹰，看着那个有着淡蓝色头发、红色眼睛的女孩走了进来。

"As I'm sure everyone remembers Ayanami Rei, I see no reason in reintroducing her. Anyway Ayanami, go ahead and take your usual seat."  
“我相信大家都记得绫波零，所以没必要再介绍她了。总之，绫波，去坐你平常的座位吧。”

At this Asuka had spun around to look around the room, only to find out that the only empty desk was the one next to hers.  
听到这话，明日香转过身来环视教室，却发现唯一空着的座位就在她旁边。

'This day just keeps getting shittier and shittier,' she thought as Ayanami sat down next to her.  
'今天真是越来越糟糕了，'她想着，当绫波坐在她旁边时。

---

'Where am I?' '我在哪儿？'

'_Where else but where you truly belong.'_  
'除了你真正属于的地方，还能是哪儿呢。'

It was then that Shinji inhaled a large amount of fluid. He felt like he was going to drown but next second realized that he was floating in LCL fluid and felt his body relax as oxygen filled his lungs.  
就在那时，真嗣吸入了一大口液体。他感觉自己快要溺水了，但下一秒意识到自己正漂浮在 LCL 液体中，随着氧气充满肺部，他的身体放松了下来。

The first thing he realized that he was naked as he floated helplessly, though that didn't seem to bother him. Around him was total blackness and he tried to spin around to look below him. Finding out that he was unable to move he continued looking up, where it all looked the same.  
他首先意识到自己赤身裸体地无助漂浮着，尽管这似乎并没有困扰他。四周一片漆黑，他试图旋转身体向下看。发现无法移动后，他继续向上看，那里看起来都一样。

'_This is where you truly belong.'_  
'这才是你真正的归属之地。'

Shinji started slightly, as he had forgotten entirely about the eerie voice.  
真嗣微微一惊，他完全忘记了那个诡异的声音。

'Who are you? What do you mean by this is were I belong? I hate this place.'  
'你是谁？你说的‘这是我该在的地方’是什么意思？我讨厌这个地方。'

'_Oh I think you'll grow to love it. Once you get used to the smell its quite pleasant to float there forever.'_  
'哦，我想你会逐渐爱上它的。一旦习惯了那股气味，永远漂浮在那里其实相当惬意。'

'I don't care, I have no reason to enjoy being here.'  
'我不在乎，我没有理由喜欢待在这里。'

'_So you don't care if something like this were to happen.'_  
'所以你不在乎这种事情是否会发生。'

The blackness became whiteness and then turned to crimson as the scene unfolded. It was similar to what Shinji had dreamt, except it was worse...far worse. Blood and gore was strung across Tokyo-3. There was so much blood and bodily fluids that the drainage systems were overflowing. It looked as though someone had spilled several thousand gallons of fruit punch and let it sit there. Except this fruit punch had pieces in it.  
黑暗转为光明，随后化作猩红，场景逐渐展开。这与真嗣梦中的情景相似，只是更加糟糕……糟糕得多。东京-3 四处血肉横飞。血液和体液如此之多，以至于排水系统都已溢出。看起来仿佛有人倾倒了数千加仑的果汁，任其流淌。只不过这果汁里混杂着碎片。

Shinji stared in horror as the scene unfolded and he was shown a rewound version of the events. The fifth angel appeared and Eva Unit-02 was deployed along with a blue and orange Eva that Shinji had not seen. Shinji watch, stunned, as the angel slashed through the earth with its energy whips, missing the two Eva's several times. Soon the Eva's lost their umbilical cord and were forced to fight on reserve power.  
真嗣惊恐地盯着眼前展开的场景，他被展示了一段倒放的事件版本。第五使徒出现，Eva 二号机与一架蓝橙相间的 Eva 被部署，这是真嗣未曾见过的。真嗣目瞪口呆地看着使徒用能量鞭划过大地，多次险些击中两架 Eva。不久，Eva 们失去了脐带电缆，被迫依靠备用电源战斗。

After that it was a battle of attrition. Soon Eva Unit-02 lost one of its arms and was sliced down the middle. Shinji had to turn away as he could almost hear Asuka's scream of pain and anger. The angel approached the Eva, to finish it off, when the blue and orange one came from the side and knocked the angel off balance. Pulling something that looked remarkably like a knife, it stabbed the angel in the chest. Repeating this several times, to no affect, the angel pushed the Eva off itself and proceeding to slashing it several more times.  
此后便是一场消耗战。很快，Eva 二号机失去了一只手臂，并被从中劈开。真嗣不得不转过头去，他几乎能听到明日香痛苦与愤怒的尖叫声。使徒逼近 Eva，准备给予致命一击，这时那架蓝橙相间的 Eva 从侧面冲来，将使徒撞得失去平衡。它抽出一把酷似刀的东西，猛刺使徒的胸膛。重复数次，却毫无效果，使徒将 Eva 推开，并继续对其进行多次劈砍。

Dodging was all the blue and orange Eva could do as its energy slowly drained. Charging forward in stabbed outwards only to have its hand sliced off and fall to the ground. Red blood flew from the angels hand as it dropped to one knee as its energy ran out. The angel observed it for a moment before looping off its head.  
蓝色与橙色的 Eva 只能不断躲避，随着能量逐渐耗尽。它冲向前试图攻击，却只换来一只手被切断，坠落地面。天使的手中喷涌出鲜血，它单膝跪地，能量耗尽。天使凝视片刻，随后斩下了它的头颅。

What followed next was random flashes of things that happened. Shinji watched as the angel sliced into a building, incinerating many humans but for the most part cutting of body parts and leaving them to bleed. Shinji watched as people from his class were killed or crushed. Toji and Kensuke where both crushed by falling rubble and Shinji had a strong urge to vomit after he heard their bones crunching. A particular painful moment happened as he watched Misato cradling a broken arm and crawling forward. A sharp piece of metal had sliced her leg off, just above the knee, preventing her from moving far.  
接下来是一连串混乱的闪回。真嗣目睹天使劈开一座建筑，大量人类被焚烧，但多数是被切断肢体，任其流血。他看到同班同学被杀或压碎。铃和健介都被落石压碎，真嗣听到他们骨头碎裂的声音，强烈地想要呕吐。尤其痛苦的一幕是，他看到美里抱着断臂，艰难爬行。一块尖锐的金属切断了她的腿，就在膝盖上方，使她无法远行。

Hardest of all was watching as Asuka slowly died. To the bitter end she tried to fight back, even though her Eva wasn't responding. When the angel had sliced her Eva in half it had only pierced part of the entry. Thanks to this Asuka didn't die immediately but it would have been kinder. She had been pierced in the stomach and now a mixture of blood and stomach acid was flowing from the open wound. Several times Shinji heard his own named mentioned in the mixture of swear words from the different languages she had learned.  
最难熬的是看着明日香慢慢死去。直到最后一刻，她仍在试图反抗，尽管她的 Eva 毫无反应。当使徒将她的 Eva 劈成两半时，只刺穿了部分插入栓。多亏了这一点，明日香没有立即死去，但那或许更为仁慈。她被刺穿了腹部，现在血液和胃酸正从开放的伤口中流出。几次听到自己的名字夹杂在她所学过的各种语言的咒骂中，真嗣感到一阵心痛。

Now Shinji hovered over the remains of what remained of the other Eva unit. Its entry plug had not been crushed surprisingly and Shinji found himself remembering more and more of his dream as events from it unfolded before his eyes. He saw the arm of the pilot sticking out, but now he saw something else...he was approaching it. His self from the vision was approaching the arm as it dangled lifelessly out of the Eva, and Shinji understood.  
现在，真嗣悬停在另一台 Eva 残骸的上方。令人惊讶的是，它的插入栓并未被压碎，随着梦境中的事件在眼前展开，真嗣发现自己越来越多地回忆起那个梦。他看到驾驶员的手臂伸出，但现在他看到了别的东西...他在接近它。梦境中的自己正接近那只从 Eva 中无力垂下的手臂，真嗣明白了。

Once again this was something that may or may not happen, and this time his decision controlled all of Tokyo-3.  
这又一次可能是也可能不会发生的事情，而这次他的决定将左右整个第三新东京市的命运。

"Figure it out yet?" "想明白了没？"

Shinji felt his body move on its own as he turned around and looked up at the Asuka from his dreams.  
真嗣感觉到自己的身体不由自主地动了起来，他转过身，抬头看向梦中出现的明日香。

"Nice little battle, to bad you weren't there, might have made a difference."  
"一场精彩的小战斗，可惜你不在，不然可能会改变些什么。"

"Are you here to give my advice or mock me?" Asked Shinji.  
"你是来给我建议的还是来嘲笑我的？" 真嗣问道。

"Oh, I'm done giving advice, I'm just here for the show.  
"哦，建议我已经给完了，现在我只是来看戏的。

"Thoughtful of you." "你真是体贴。"

Shinji's body turned then as if to show what happened one final time. 'I know what I've got to do, its just doing it is the problem.'  
真嗣的身体随后转了过来，仿佛要最后一次展示发生了什么。'我知道我必须做什么，只是做起来是个问题。'

"If your done feeling sorry for yourself I suggest you go back."  
“如果你已经自怜自艾够了，我建议你回去。”

"Why? I thought you weren't giving advice anymore."  
“为什么？我以为你不再提供建议了。”

"Don't think of it so much as advice. More of a friendly reminder."  
"别把它想成是建议，更像是友好的提醒。"

"Your my friend?" "你是我的朋友？"

Asuka scratched her chin thoughtfully, "Hmmm, I suppose, for now at least I am. Put it this way I don't want you to die."  
明日香若有所思地挠了挠下巴，“嗯，我想，至少目前我是。这么说吧，我不想你死。”

"Thanks...I think."  "谢谢...我想。"

---

Shinji felt his eyes open and if not for the fact that he heard the slamming of a door he would have thought thats what woke him up. Sitting up straighter he assumed that it wasn't Misato and could only guess that it had to be Asuka. Looking over, he noticed that it was a few minutes after noon. So she had left school early again.  
真嗣感到自己的眼睛睁开了，如果不是听到了门被猛力关上的声音，他可能会以为这就是唤醒他的原因。他坐得更直了些，猜测那不是美里，只能猜想那一定是明日香。他环顾四周，注意到已经是中午过后几分钟了。所以她又提前离开了学校。

Standing up, Shinji walked towards his bedroom door and slid it open slightly. Next second the door was slammed shut and Shinji was forced to take a step back.  
真嗣站起身，走向他的卧室门，轻轻地滑开了一点。下一秒，门被猛地关上，真嗣不得不后退了一步。

Slightly worried about her he took a hesitant step and said, "Err, Asuka...is everything okay?"  
他略感担忧，犹豫地迈出一步，问道：“呃，明日香……一切都还好吗？”

Without getting an answer he slid the door open again and this time without it getting shut in his face. Looking around quickly he didn't see her sitting at the kitchen table but heard talking coming from the living room.  
没有得到回答，他再次拉开门，这次没有被门甩在脸上。他迅速环顾四周，没看到她在厨房的桌子旁，却听到客厅传来说话声。

Walking into it, slightly nervous, he saw her laying on the couch, eating a bag of potato chips and flipping through the channels.  
他略带紧张地走进去，看到她正躺在沙发上，吃着一袋薯片，不停地换着电视频道。

Opening his mouth, Shinji was about to ask if anything had happened at school when he got rude answer.  
张开口，真嗣正要问学校是否发生了什么事，却得到了一个粗鲁的回答。

"Shut it Shinji, I don't want to talk you!"  
“闭嘴，真嗣，我不想跟你说话！”

Shinji raised an eyebrow at her. Did he do something that had made her angry? For the life of him he couldn't remember. Maybe it was what Misato had said about her staying home and looking after him. Shinji really couldn't care if she was there or not. It didn't make any difference to him whatsoever. Even so though he was annoyed that she was angry at him for something that he probably didn't even do.  
真嗣对她挑了挑眉。他做了什么让她生气的事吗？他怎么也想不起来。也许是因为美里提到她留在家里照顾他。真嗣真的不在乎她在不在。这对他没有任何影响。即便如此，他还是对她因为他可能根本没做过的事而生气感到不爽。

Smirking slightly he said, "What, did someone sneak a peak while you were at the drinking fountain again?"  
他微微冷笑道：“怎么，又有人在饮水机旁偷看你了？”

Asuka tore her eyes away from the T.V. briefly to give Shinji a heart piercing stare. Without replying to his comment she turned her gaze back towards the T.V.  
绫波零短暂地从电视上移开目光，向真嗣投去一个穿心的瞪视。她没有回应他的话，又将视线转回了电视。

'Guess she really doesn't want to talk, but I know one thing she will want to discuss.'  
“看来她真的不想说话，但我知道有一件事她肯定会想讨论。”

Walking out of the living room he walked into the kitchen and opened the fridge door. Yelling over he shoulder he said, "So what does your highness want for dinner tonight?"  
他走出客厅，步入厨房，打开了冰箱门。他扭头喊道：“那么，尊贵的大人今晚想吃什么呢？”

Shinji thought he heard something between a snarl and half a laugh.  
真嗣觉得他听到了介于咆哮和半声笑之间的声音。

Replying back she said, "Whatever the fuck you feel like. I don't give a shit right now."  
她回敬道：“随便你他妈想做什么。我现在不在乎。”

'Wow,' thought Shinji. 'If she didn't care about dinner than something pretty bad must have happened.  
'哇哦，' 真嗣心想。'如果她连晚饭都不在乎了，那一定是发生了相当糟糕的事情。

Ignoring dinner for now he walked back into the living room and stood directly in front of him.  
暂时不理会晚饭，他走回客厅，直接站在他面前。

"Move it ass-hole." “滚开，混蛋。”

"No. If you don't even care about dinner than something obviously happened."  
"不，如果你连晚饭都不在乎，那显然是发生了什么事。"

"It doesn't concern you!"  
"这不关你的事！"

"It might not but the Asuka I see in front of me is one that I certainly don't like living with."  
"可能不关我的事，但我眼前的这个明日香，绝对不是我想一起生活的样子。"

"As if you enjoy living with me anyway," she whispered.  
"好像你本来就很享受和我一起生活似的，" 她低声说道。

"On occasion I do, if you must know," mumbled Shinji.  
"偶尔是的，如果你非要知道的话，" 真嗣咕哝道。

Asuka seemed rather taken aback at this and her expression soften slightly. "Fine baka, if you must know I have to sit next to my least favorite person in the world at school now."  
明日香对此似乎颇为意外，她的表情稍稍缓和了一些。"好吧，笨蛋，如果你非要知道的话，我现在在学校不得不坐在世界上最讨厌的人旁边。"

Shinji almost laughed, "I thought I was your least favorite person in the world."  
真嗣差点笑出声来，“我以为我是你在这个世界上最不喜欢的人呢。”

"Its close, but your my second least favorite."  
“差不多吧，但你是我第二不喜欢的人。”

"Glad to hear it. So why the hell is this such a problem?"  
“很高兴听到这个。那这他妈的为什么是个问题？”

"Because I also have to-" Asuka paused, mentioning that Rei was the pilot of Eva Unit-00 wouldn't be smart. Shinji was supposed to know as little as possible if he wouldn't pilot Unit-01, at least thats what Misato said.  
"因为我也得——" 明日香停顿了一下，提到绫波是零号机的驾驶员并不明智。如果真嗣不驾驶初号机，他应该知道得越少越好，至少美里是这么说的。

"I just don't like people like her, she's stuck up, thinks she's so great."  
"我就是不喜欢她那种人，她自命不凡，觉得自己了不起。"

Shinji frowned, "You act as though you know her personally."  
真嗣皱眉道："你表现得好像很了解她似的。"

Thankfully Asuka was saved the need of replying when her phone vibrated briefly. Flipping it open she read a very short message from Misato. Flipping it closed she bit her lip slightly and stood up.  
幸好，当她的手机短暂震动时，明日香免去了回答的必要。她翻开手机，看到美里发来的一条简短信息。合上手机后，她微微咬了咬嘴唇，站起身来。

"Anything wrong, Asuka?" “有什么不对劲吗，明日香？”

"No, I just have to go to Nerv and do some tests, its standard."  
“没有，我只是得去 NERV 做一些测试，这是常规流程。”

Shinji nodded, "Then what do you want for dinner?"  
真嗣点点头，“那你想吃什么晚餐？”

This time Asuka gave him a long list of German foods and told him to just make one every night and to start at the top of the list. Shinji frowned down at it not liking some of the choices.  
这次明日香给了他一份长长的德国食物清单，并告诉他每晚做一种，从清单顶部开始。真嗣皱着眉头看着它，不喜欢其中的一些选择。

"I'll be back late, with Misato most likely."  
“我可能会晚点回来，和美里一起。”

"Okay..." Shinji felt like he had to say something but couldn't quite get his tongue wrapped around it.  
"好吧..." 真嗣觉得他得说点什么，但舌头就是绕不过来。

"Cya later then." "那回头见。"

"Yeah bye," Shinji mumbled.  
"嗯，再见，" 真嗣咕哝道。

When Asuka closed the door she flipped open her phone and called Misato as she started to run slightly. The first thing that she heard was a lot of rambling in the back round when Misato answered the phone.  
当明日香关上门时，她迅速打开手机，边跑边拨通了美里。她听到的第一件事是美里接电话时背景中的一大堆杂音。

"Asuka are you on your way."  
“明日香，你已经在路上了吗？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"Good, we don't have much time. It will hit land fall in thirty minutes. I'll brief you quickly and then we'll send you up." Here Misato paused and asked, "What did you tell Shinji?"  
“很好，我们时间不多了。它将在三十分钟后登陆。我会快速给你简报，然后我们就派你上去。”这时美里停顿了一下，问道，“你告诉真嗣什么了？”

"Tests," she said simply.  
"测试," 她简单地说道。

"Good, having two kids to worry about will just make me age faster."  
"好啊，有两个孩子要担心只会让我老得更快。"

Even though the joke had good intentions Asuka wasn't in the mood for joking around. The last thing she intended to do was tell Shinji what she really was doing, though she guessed he'd realize it in half an hour.  
尽管这个玩笑本意是好的，但明日香此刻并没有心情开玩笑。她最不想做的就是告诉真嗣她真正在做什么，尽管她猜他半小时后就会意识到。

---

Shinji had guessed that something was wrong, judging by the brief worried look that had passed over Asuka's face the moment she had gotten off the phone with Misato. Completely ignoring thoughts of dinner he sat down on the couch where Asuka had recently laid. The first thing that had come to his mind was an angel attack, though she had shot that idea down quickly with her mention of tests. But he didn't believe her, tests couldn't make a person go from calm to nervous in the span of seconds, and Asuka was not someone to get riled up easily.  
从明日香接完美里电话后那一闪而过的忧虑表情，真嗣猜测事情有些不对劲。他完全忽略了晚餐的想法，坐在了明日香刚刚躺过的沙发上。他首先想到的是使徒袭击，但她提到测试时迅速否定了这个想法。但他并不相信，测试不可能让人在几秒钟内从平静变得紧张，而明日香也不是那种轻易会被激怒的人。

Rolling off the couch he stood up and walked over to the nearest window and looked briefly.  
他从沙发上滚下来，站起身走到最近的窗户旁，短暂地向外望去。

'Well, if an angel was to show I'd feel it before I saw it,' he thought.  
“嗯，如果有使徒出现，我会在看到之前就感应到。”他心想。

Turning around he was about to walk to the kitchen to make a half hearted attempt on one of the many things that Asuka had give him to cook when he noticed the ceiling fan shake. Pausing for a moment he looked up at it again and it gave another small wobble, slightly larger than last time.  
他转过身，正打算走向厨房，勉强尝试做明日香给他的众多菜谱中的一项，这时他注意到天花板风扇在摇晃。他停顿了一下，再次抬头看去，风扇又轻轻晃动了一下，比上次幅度稍大。

Next, Shinji felt the ground beneath him shake violently and he had to brace himself so as not to fall on his face. When the tremors had settled he immediately bolted towards the door. Only then did he realize that an alarm had gone off and people were crowding around on the streets below, looking for a suitable shelter.  
紧接着，真嗣感觉到脚下的地面剧烈震动，他不得不稳住自己以免摔倒。当震动平息后，他立刻冲向门口。直到那时，他才意识到警报已经响起，人们正聚集在下面的街道上，寻找合适的避难所。

"Damn it, she didn't have to lie to me."  
“该死，她没必要对我撒谎。”

Taking off down the stairs he had to weave in and out of the sea of people that were trying to get to the shelter first. In the back round a cool female voice was telling everyone not to panic and to enter the shelters in an orderly fashion. Shinji had to smirk at the calmness in her voice. It was obviously a pre-recording and whoever had done it was miles away by now.  
他迅速冲下楼梯，不得不在试图抢先到达避难所的人群中穿梭。背景中，一个冷静的女声在告诉每个人不要惊慌，有序进入避难所。真嗣不得不对她的镇定语气暗自一笑。显然这是一段预先录制的音频，而录制者此刻早已远在千里之外。

Fighting his way out of the mass of people he managed to recognize two people from his class, Touji and Kensuke. Shinji was almost tempted to approach them but was deterred when he remembered what they had done to both him and Asuka. It seemed though that they had something they wanted to discuss as they both ran up to him.  
他奋力挤出人群，认出了班上的两个人，东治和健介。真嗣几乎想上前打招呼，但随即想起了他们对他和明日香所做的一切，便打消了念头。不过，他们似乎有话要说，两人都向他跑来。

"Hey fuck face!" “嘿，混蛋！”

Shinji had a sudden urge to rip Touji's skull out of his head but restrained himself. Asking in as calm a voice as he could muster he said, "What?"  
真嗣突然有种冲动，想把东治的头骨从他脑袋里扯出来，但还是忍住了。他尽可能平静地问道：“什么？”

"Where's Asuka, you live with her right, sleaze ball?"  
“惣流在哪里，你不是和她住一起吗，人渣？”

'Of course, they only wanted to know where she was.'  
“当然，他们只是想知道她在哪里。”

"No idea where she went, she took off immediately after she got home." Even though he wasn't a part of Nerv, telling other people what Asuka was involved with was not something that he considered telling.  
"不知道她去哪儿了，一回家就立刻离开了。" 尽管他不是 Nerv 的一员，但告诉别人关于明日香的事情，并不是他会考虑的事情。

"Tch, dick head you just want her all yo yourself."  
"切，你个混蛋就是想独占她。"

"Yeah, whatever," said Shinji not caring at all at this point.  
"是啊，随便吧，" 真嗣此时根本不在乎。

Turning around he started walking away when he felt a strong hand on his shoulder.  
他转过身，正要走开，却感到一只强有力的手搭在了他的肩膀上。

"Hey where you even listening to me!"  
“嘿，你到底有没有在听我说话！”

Shinji scowled back, "I tend to ignore people who bother the shit out of me."  
真嗣皱着眉头回道：“我通常会无视那些让我烦得要死的人。”

"Why you bastard!" “你这个混蛋！”

Touji brought his hand back to punch Shinji in the face again when he heard another voice over the loud speaker, this time slightly different.  
当听到另一个通过扩音器传来的声音，这次略有不同，真嗣准备再次挥拳打向真治的脸时，东治停了下来。

"Those that have not entered a shelter block please do so immediately, the city will descend in five minutes."  
“尚未进入避难区的市民请立即前往，城市将在五分钟后下沉。”

"Touji we should get to one," said a worried Kensuke.  
"图尔基，我们得去一个避难所。" 健介担忧地说道。

"Fine." "好吧。"

Touji backed away from Shinji and threw a scowl at him before turning towards the shelter blocks only to find that none now remained.  
图尔基从真嗣身边退开，向他投去一个怒视，然后转向避难所区块，却发现现在一个也不剩了。

"God damn it, look at what you made us do."  
"该死的，看看你让我们做了什么。"

"Its your one fault for harassing me, so if you die don't expect me to cry over your body"  
"这就是你骚扰我的代价，所以如果你死了，别指望我会为你流泪。"

"Thats it fuck face I'm beating the shit out of you."  
"就这样了，混蛋，我要把你打得屁滚尿流。"

Touji took several steps forward and probably would have knocked Shinji out again if Kensuke hadn't stepped in between them.  
冬二向前走了几步，要不是剑介及时插到他们中间，他可能又要给真嗣一拳。

"Guys this isn't the time to be fighting, we need to find another shelter before Tokyo-3 goes into lockdown."  
“伙计们，现在不是打架的时候，我们需要在东京-3 进入封锁前找到另一个避难所。”

As much as Shinji hated these two, Kensuke had a point. If Tokyo-3 sank into the Geofront then they'd fall several hundred feet to there death.  
尽管真嗣讨厌这两个人，但剑介说得有道理。如果东京-3 沉入地底，他们就会从几百英尺的高处坠落而死。

"Whatever, just stay out of my way," said Touji.  
“随便你，别挡我的路就行，”冬二说道。

'Likewise,' though Shinji.  
“彼此彼此，”真嗣心想。

Together the trio ran through the streets of Tokyo-3 quickly searching for a shelter, though without much luck.  
三人一起在第三新东京市的街道上奔跑，急切地寻找避难所，却运气不佳。

"Hey Shinji I'm rather surprised that your not with Asuka actually," said Kensuke.  
“嘿，真嗣，我挺惊讶你居然没和明日香在一起，”健介说道。

Shinji blinked back at him, rather surprised, "What makes you say that?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼看着他，同样感到惊讶，“你为什么这么说？”

Kensuke shrugged, "Well, you certainly know her better than anybody else at the school so it seems natural that you'd be with her more."  
健介耸了耸肩，“嗯，你在学校里肯定比任何人都更了解她，所以看起来你和她在一起更自然。”

"I...suppose," Shinji said slowly.  
"我...我想是的," 真嗣缓缓说道。

"But what are you doing out here. Where you looking for her?"  
"但你在这里做什么？是在找她吗？"

Shinji had to think about that for a second. What was he really doing out here? He already knew where and what Asuka was doing and he didn't have any inclination to go to where she was. Even so though, there was something akin to a driving force pushing him forward.  
真嗣不得不思考了一下。他到底在这里做什么？他已经知道明日香在哪里以及她在做什么，而且他也没有任何冲动想要去找她。即便如此，却有一种类似驱动力的东西在推动他前进。

Shaking his head he said, "Not sure, can't give you a correct answer."  
他摇摇头说：“不确定，没法给你一个正确的答案。”

"Hmm I see," nodded Kensuke thoughtfully.  
“嗯，我明白了，”健介若有所思地点点头。

Shinji was slightly annoyed at how Kensuke was acting around him right now. It was almost as if he was somebody that he had just met and everything that he had done to him was completely thrown out the window. If he thought they were friends he was sorely wrong.  
真嗣对健介此刻对待他的态度感到有些恼火。这简直就像是他刚刚认识的一个人，之前为他所做的一切都被抛诸脑后。如果他认为他们是朋友，那他可就大错特错了。

"Come on lets check over here."  
“快点，我们去那边看看。”

As soon as Shinji got the words out of his mouth the earth shook violently as the angel made landfall. Simultaneously Eva Unit-02 was brought up the elevator and broke the surface just to see the angel make landfall.  
真嗣话音刚落，大地便剧烈震动起来，天使登陆了。与此同时，EVA 二号机被升降机升起，破土而出，正好目睹天使登陆的瞬间。

Kensuke and Touji stood in a slight daze as they watched the Eva charge towards the oncoming angel.  
健介和薰站在原地，略显恍惚地看着 EVA 向迎面而来的天使冲去。

"Wha-what is that?" Stuttered the stupid jock.  
“那、那是什么？”那个笨蛋运动员结巴道。

Shinji didn't feel like explaining and just yelled over his shoulder, "Forget it we need to find a shelter."  
真嗣不想解释，只是回头喊道：“别管了，我们得找个避难所。”

As the two ran they could here the crumbling of buildings as the ones not brought into the Geofront crumble while the two fought.  
两人奔跑时，可以听到建筑倒塌的声音，那些未被带入地底都市的建筑在两人的战斗中崩塌。

Several seconds later the three of them found a shelter that still had some room left in it, however it could only hold two more people. The trio stood there briefly while the person holding the door open waited at the argument that was soon going to break out. Touji was prepared to fight for his if he had to when he heard someone laugh and say, "Get in you idiots, I never intended on entering a shelter anyway."  
几秒钟后，他们三人找到了一个还有些空间的避难所，不过只能再容纳两个人。三人短暂地站在那里，而那个扶着门的人则在等待即将爆发的争执。当听到有人笑道“进去吧，你们这些傻瓜，反正我也没打算进避难所。”时，东治已经准备好为他的位置而战了。

Spinning around, Touji and Kensuke saw Shinji smirking back at them.  
东治和真嗣转过身，看到真嗣正对他们得意地笑着。

"Get your asses in, this is what we've been walking around for haven't we."  
“快点进去，我们不就是为了这个才四处走的吗。”

Touji hoped directly in but Kensuke was a little hesitant. "Shinji you are going to look for another one, right?"  
真嗣直接走了进去，但剑介有些犹豫。“真嗣，你会去找另一个的，对吧？”

Shinji shrugged, "Maybe..." He already knew he wouldn't.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，“也许吧……”他其实已经知道他不会去。

Kensuke nodded and walked in behind Touji and the door was closed.  
剑介点点头，跟在真嗣后面走了进去，门随后被关上了。

Shinji had already turned around when Kensuke entered the shelter and was already walking in the opposite direction, to where the two demons were fighting, as he saw them.  
真嗣在健司进入避难所时已经转身，正朝着两个恶魔战斗的方向走去，他看到了他们。

'That Eva is definitely Asuka's, I just hope she can take that thing on.'  
'那台 EVA 肯定是明日香的，我只希望她能对付得了那东西。'

Turning around a corner he was hit in the face by a whirlwind of dust and small debris as a building had just collapsed that the angel had fallen in. Coughing slightly he looked up just to see the Eva flying through the air as the angel had counterattacked and wrapped several energy whips around the Eva's arm, and thrown it.  
转过一个拐角，他被一阵由建筑物倒塌引起的尘土和小碎片旋风击中了脸。轻轻咳嗽了一下，他抬头一看，只见 EVA 被天使反击，几条能量鞭缠绕在 EVA 的手臂上，将其抛向空中。

Quickly darting into an alley way Shinji just barely managed to dodge a car as it went soaring directly over where he had been standing moments before. Looking around the corner he saw the Eva get back up quickly and stare down its enemy. Grabbing something from a holster in its back it brought a small knife out which glowed white and charged at the angel.  
迅速闪入一条小巷，真嗣险些躲过一辆疾驰而过的汽车，那车几乎是擦着他刚才站立的地方飞驰而过。探头望向拐角，他看到初号机迅速起身，直面敌人。从背后的枪套中抽出某物，手中亮起一把白色光芒的小刀，向天使冲去。

Slicing across what would be considered its chest, the angel took several steps back to avoid it. Grabbing the arm that had the knife in it, it quickly twisted it and Shinji heard several pops as the arm joints disconnected.  
刀锋划过天使的胸前，它连退几步避开攻击。随即抓住持刀的手臂，迅速扭转，真嗣听到几声关节脱位的脆响。

Shinji was starting to become worried as the angel was repeatedly slashing at Unit-02. Next second though the ground shook again and several feet in front of him soared up the one that he had pilot Eva Unit-01.  
随着天使不断攻击二号机，真嗣开始感到担忧。然而下一秒，地面再次震动，在他前方几英尺处，他驾驶的初号机一飞冲天。

Shinji stared at it and could almost hear that voice in the back of his head. What he couldn't understand though was how someone else was able to pilot it. He had thought that anybody else that tried to pilot it would immediately die.  
真嗣盯着它，几乎能听到脑海深处的那个声音。但他无法理解的是，为什么其他人能够驾驶它。他曾以为任何试图驾驶它的人都会立即丧命。

Next second though, as the Eva tried to take several clumsy steps forward, it fell directly on its side and fell silent.  
然而下一秒，当 EVA 试图笨拙地向前迈出几步时，它直接侧身倒下，陷入了沉默。

Shinji was several hundred feet away from where the Eva fell and hesitated as he looked at its motionless body. He felt as though some unnatural force was pulling him towards the Eva. Inching closer he hesitated as he reached the entry plug and glanced around at anything that would open it.  
真嗣距离 EVA 倒下的地方有几百英尺远，他犹豫地看着它一动不动的身体。他感觉有一种超自然的力量在拉扯着他向 EVA 靠近。他慢慢接近，当到达插入栓时，他犹豫了一下，环顾四周寻找任何可以打开它的东西。

Reaching out for it a gust of wind threatened to knock him over as Unit 02 sent the angel backwards against a building collapsing it several blocks away from where Shinji stood. Looking behind himself hesitantly, he reached out for the handle for which he thought opened the entry plug. Though at the first touch of it he pulled back quickly as blisters erupted all over his skin. It was well over oven temperature.  
伸手去抓，一阵狂风差点将他吹倒，02 号机将使徒击退，使其撞上远处的一栋建筑，几条街区外，真嗣站立的地方轰然倒塌。他犹豫地回头望去，伸手去抓他认为能打开插入栓的把手。然而，刚一触碰，他便迅速缩回手，皮肤上瞬间冒出水泡。温度早已超过了烤箱的极限。

Grimacing at the pain now racking his right hand he took a deep breath, and for the life of him couldn't understand why he was doing it, and gripped both hands on the valve and twisted it.  
他因右手的剧痛而皱眉，深吸一口气，尽管自己也不明白为何要这么做，但还是用双手紧紧抓住阀门，用力旋转。

Ignoring the steadily increasing pain on his hands he turned the valve until it was all the way on the other side.  
他无视手上不断加剧的疼痛，转动阀门直到完全转到另一侧。

As the entry plug opened several gallons of LCL fluid leaked out, showering Shinji in it. Spitting a mouthful of the disgusting liquid he got his first look at the first child, Ayanami Rei.  
随着插入栓打开，几加仑的 LCL 液体泄漏出来，将真嗣淋了个透。他吐出一口这令人作呕的液体，第一次见到了第一适格者，绫波零。

Shinji didn't know what he had expected but not this. She was the person that he'd dreamt about. She had light blue hair and dark blue eyes, but the face...puzzled him. It seemed familiar somehow.  
真嗣不知道自己期待的是什么，但绝不是这样。她是他梦见过的人。她有着淡蓝色的头发和深蓝色的眼睛，但那张脸……让他感到困惑。不知为何，它似乎有些熟悉。

Hesitating slightly Shinji asked in a voice that sounded like it didn't want to be answered, "Hey, are you okay?"  
真嗣略显迟疑地问道，声音听起来似乎并不期待得到回答，“嘿，你还好吗？”

The girl shifted slightly at first and then slowly looked to where Shinji was looking in from the outside. Her expression was unreadable, neither happy nor angry that someone had asked her if she was all right.  
女孩起初微微动了动，随后缓缓转向真嗣从外面注视的方向。她的表情难以捉摸，既不高兴也不生气，有人问她是否还好。

Sitting slowly up in the plug Shinji then noticed that beads of sweat were on her eyes brows and she seemed to be clutching her side slightly.  
真嗣慢慢坐起身来，注意到她眼眉上挂着汗珠，似乎在轻轻按着侧腹。

Shinji bit his tongue. Here was this completely weird girl, who he had been dreaming about, and now he had just met her. What's more she seemed to be clutching her side as though she was injured.  
真嗣咬了咬舌头。这个完全古怪的女孩，他一直梦见的人，现在他刚刚遇见了她。更甚的是，她似乎在按着侧腹，好像受了伤。

Shinji was about to open his mouth though when the girl, surprisingly beat him to it.  
正当真嗣准备开口时，那女孩却出人意料地抢先了一步。

"Are you Ikari Shinji?" “你是碇真嗣吗？”

For some reason the mention of his last named seemed to anger him and a slight crease appeared on his forehead before he said, "Yeah I am."  
不知为何，提到他的姓氏似乎激怒了他，眉间微微皱起，随后他答道：“是的，我是。”

The girl nodded slightly and then got up shakily from the Eva Unit and hobbled slowly over to the opening in the plug.  
女孩微微点头，然后颤抖着从 Eva 机体中站起，一瘸一拐地慢慢走向插入栓的开口处。

"Hey what are you doing?" Asked Shinji as the girl got out.  
“嘿，你在干什么？”真嗣问道，看着女孩走出来。

Either she didn't here him or ignored his comment, either way she didn't answer.  
她要么是没听到他的话，要么是忽视了他的评论，总之她没有回答。

Shinji backed out of the way slightly as she took several steps forward and then seemed to loose her balance. Expecting something of this nature to happen, Shinji took several steps forward and caught her around the waist before she was able to hit the ground. It was then that Shinji realized that large amounts of blood were flowing from her side, which apparently had a large wound.  
真嗣微微退开，她向前走了几步，随后似乎失去了平衡。预料到这种情况，真嗣快步上前，在她摔倒之前搂住了她的腰。这时真嗣才发现，大量鲜血正从她的侧腹涌出，显然那里有一个大伤口。

Shinji had a strong urge then to yell at her, to ask why the hell she was piloting that thing in her condition. He never got the words out though as he assumed she wouldn't care.  
真嗣当时强烈地想要对她大喊，问她为什么在这种状态下还要驾驶那东西。但他没有说出口，因为他认为她不会在意。

"Come on, lets get out of here."  
“来吧，我们离开这里。”

"No."

Shinji had to do a double take as he saw her looking over at the Eva Unit.  
真嗣不得不再次确认，因为他看到她正朝 EVA 机体那边看去。

With a frown on his face Shinji said, "Come on, your hurt, I don't want to be here, and those things are capable of leveling a city."  
真嗣皱着眉头说：“拜托，你受伤了，我也不想待在这里，那些东西可是能夷平一座城市的。”

"No."

Shinji was starting to get annoyed and was about to retort angrily back at the girl when she said, "The Eva, it wants you to pilot it."  
真嗣开始感到恼火，正要生气地反驳那个女孩时，她却说：“EVA，它希望你来驾驶。”

Shinji blinked twice before he understood what she was talking about. Shaking his head he said, "No, I can't."  
真嗣眨了两次眼才明白她在说什么。他摇摇头说：“不，我不能。”

"And why is that?" “为什么呢？”

"Because I..." “因为我是……”

The girl looked blankly back at him as he turned his head the other way, biting down on his lip, unsure of what to say.  
女孩茫然地回望着他，而他则转向另一边，咬着嘴唇，不知该说什么。

"I don't like it," he finally whispered.  
"我不喜欢它，"他终于低声说道。

"Why don't you like it?"  
"你为什么不喜欢它？"

"I don't know damn it!"  
“我不知道，该死！”

His outburst didn't even seemed to faze her as she looked calmly back at him. Turning towards the Eva she said, "Only you can pilot that Eva, I tried and wasn't able to."  
他的爆发似乎并未影响到她，她平静地回望着他。转向 Eva，她说道：“只有你能驾驶那台 Eva，我试过了，但做不到。”

Shinji grumbled slightly at her words. He didn't want to, hell no, but the visions. He couldn't get the damn things out of his head.  
对于她的话，真嗣小声嘀咕了一下。他并不想，绝对不想，但那些幻象。他无法将那些该死的东西从脑海中赶走。

"It's asking you to go, why don't you?"  
"它让你去，你为什么不去呢？"

Shinji maybe thought it would be worth it just to get away from this girls questions.  
真嗣可能觉得，只要能逃离这些女孩的问题，就值得一试。

Looking over at the Eva briefly he could have sworn he felt a tug on his shirt as though it was pulling him towards itself.  
他短暂地瞥了一眼 Eva，几乎可以发誓感觉到自己的衬衫被拉了一下，仿佛是在把他拉向它。

Sighing in a dejected way he said, "Do I have a choice." It wasn't a question, it was acknowledgement.  
他沮丧地叹了口气，说道：“我有选择的余地吗？”这并非疑问，而是承认。

Letting go of the girl she watched him as he slowly walked over to the Eva took a few hesitating moments and climbed in. Almost at once the entry plug resealed itself as though it had found what it wanted.  
放开女孩后，她看着他慢慢走向 Eva，犹豫片刻后爬了进去。几乎就在他进入驾驶舱的瞬间，插入栓立刻重新封闭，仿佛找到了它所需要的东西。

Inside the entry plug Shinji immediately felt the voice talking to him again.  
在插入栓内，真嗣立刻再次感受到了那个声音在对他讲话。

"_Glad to see that your back."_  
"很高兴看到你回来了。"

"Don't expect me for long."  
"别指望我会待很久。"

"_You sure? I feel like I'm getting to know you better every time you climb in. Only I know what is deep in your heart."_  
"你确定吗？每次你爬进来，我都感觉越来越了解你。只有我知道你内心深处的秘密。"

"Thats great but how about we get moving."  
"那太好了，不过我们还是动身吧。"

"_Gonna save that red Eva."_  
"要去救那个红色 Eva。"

"Something like that," Shinji mumbled.  
"差不多吧，" 真嗣咕哝道。"

Trying to remember how he had done it before he put everyone ounce of his thought it making the Eva stand up. Slowly but surely it did.  
努力回忆着之前是如何做到的，他将每一分心思都投入到让 Eva 站起来的行动中。虽然缓慢，但确实做到了。

From the right Asuka saw this and smirked into the transceivers that were built into the entry plug. "Might as well stay down first child, I'm almost done."  
从右边，明日香通过内置在插入栓中的通讯器看到了这一幕，并得意地笑了。“最好还是先躺下吧，初号机，我差不多快完成了。”

"Err, hey...Asuka." “呃，嘿...明日香。”

Silence greeted Shinji's sudden intrusion at into battle. Asuka didn't reply, whether she was glad or angry Shinji didn't find out. However in the command center of Nerv Misato was beside herself with worry when she heard Shinji's voice over the intercom.  
沉默迎接了真嗣突如其来的参战。明日香没有回应，无论是高兴还是生气，真嗣都无从得知。然而在 NERV 的指挥中心，当听到真嗣通过通讯器传来的声音时，美里担心得几乎要崩溃了。

"Shinji what the hell do you think your doing," yelled Misato straight into the entry plug. Shinji felt like his ears were going to explode.  
“真嗣，你到底在想什么？”美里对着插入栓大喊。真嗣感觉自己的耳朵都要炸了。

"Helping, I think." “我想，是在帮忙。”

"You get out this instance."  
"你这次给我出去。"

"No. I'm in and staying, for now."  
"不，我现在要留下来，暂时。"

Suddenly a new voice came over the intercom and Shinji recognized it to be his father.  
突然，一个新的声音通过对讲机传来，真嗣立刻认出那是他父亲的声音。

"Am I to understand that you wont run away this time," he said in his usual drawl.  
"我是否可以理解为，这次你不会逃跑了，"他用一贯的拖腔说道。

"I'm here until I leave, and only I decide that."  
"我会留在这里，直到我自己决定离开。"

"Nerv does not employee selfish people."  
"NERV 不会雇佣自私的人。"

'Then why the hell are you here,' Shinji felt like saying.  
“那你他妈的为什么在这里，”真嗣感觉自己想说。

Ignoring his dad and everybody else at the command center he turned to see the angel flying through the air again as Asuka had just hit it with a metal light post.  
无视他的父亲和指挥中心里的其他人，他转身看到使徒再次飞过空中，因为明日香刚刚用一根金属灯柱击中了它。

"Heh, try getting up after that you bastard."  
“哼，挨了这下看你还怎么爬起来，混蛋。”

"Asuka, I don't think thats enough to-"  
"明日香，我觉得这还不够——"

Once again she completely ignored him.  
她又一次完全无视了他。

Sighing to himself he thought he should have suspected this attitude. Likely she wanted all the glory and didn't care what his thoughts were on the matter, typical.  
他暗自叹息，心想自己早该料到这种态度。她大概只想独揽荣耀，根本不在乎他对这件事的看法，真是典型的。

"_Aren't you going to do anything?"_  
"你难道不打算做点什么吗？"

"I didn't do anything last time, you took over."  
"上次我什么都没做，是你接手的。"

"_Thats right, I had fun. All right since I had my fun I'll help you this time."_  
"没错，我玩得很开心。好吧，既然我玩够了，这次就帮你一把。"

The Eva's nerves suddenly bore into the metal of the entry plug and burst through into sea of LCL fluid were they started floating. Shinji eyed them worriedly and said, "Why are you using those things again?"  
EVA 的神经突然穿透插入栓的金属，冲入 LCL 溶液中开始漂浮。真嗣担忧地看着它们，问道：“为什么又用这些东西？”

"_I've told you its easier to sync with you, because it is particularly you."_  
“我告诉过你，与你同步更容易，正是因为你。”

"What is that supposed to mean?"  
“那是什么意思？”

"_Something that doesn't concern you."_  
"与你无关的事。"

Without warning the nerves pierced Shinji's skin and dug into his body where they wrapped around his own nerves. Slowly blood started to leak from the wounds.  
毫无预警地，神经刺穿了真嗣的皮肤，深入他的身体，缠绕在他的神经上。慢慢地，血液开始从伤口中渗出。

"_Hmm, the mixing of the blood and LCL fluid isn't going as well as I'd hoped. Their is a shortage of the LCL fluid since you opened it earlier. Guess it can't be helped will have to rely on your blood."_  
"嗯，血液与 LCL 液体的混合并不如预期顺利。由于你之前打开过，LCL 液体不足。看来只能依靠你的血液了，没办法。"

"And what does my blood have to do with anything."  
"我的血与这一切有何关系。"

"_You ask to many questions, just sit there and watch."_  
"你问得太多了，就坐在那儿看着吧。"

Eva Unit 01 then let out a roar that shattered the windows of the buildings around it. Crouching down on all fours it dashed quickly off against the ground and hurled itself at the angel. The angel, completely focused on Unit 02 was caught of guard and sent hurling into the nearest building. Jumping up and down, Eva Unit 01 let out another loud roar as it charged at the angel again.  
随后，Eva 初号机发出一声咆哮，震碎了周围建筑的窗户。它四肢着地，迅速冲向地面，猛地扑向使徒。使徒全神贯注于二号机，猝不及防被撞进了最近的建筑。初号机跳跃着，再次发出震耳欲聋的咆哮，又一次向使徒发起冲锋。

Grabbing one of the energy whips it squeezed it quickly and broke it in a shower of blood and gore. Letting out a wounded howl the angel took several clumsy steps back only to be greet by a savage punch from Eva Unit 02.  
抓住其中一条能量鞭，它迅速挤压并将其在一阵血肉横飞中折断。天使发出受伤的嚎叫，踉跄后退几步，却迎面挨了 Eva 初号机 02 的一记猛拳。

"Take that Bastard." “接招吧，混蛋。”

Shinji was almost felt like he was in a drunken rage as he watched things unfold from inside the entry plug. He hated not knowing what to do and being at the mercy of the voice in the Eva, or what he wast starting to call the Devil.  
真嗣在插入栓内几乎感觉自己像是在醉酒般的狂怒中目睹这一切。他痛恨不知所措，任由 Eva 中的声音摆布，或者他开始称之为恶魔的存在。

As the angel backed slowly away from Tokyo-3, planning to retreat, Unit 01 quickly pounced on it and grabbed it by the neck and twisted it savagely until it broke with the sound of a battleship bombardment.  
天使缓缓后退，打算撤离东京-3，但初号机迅速扑上前去，一把抓住其颈部，猛力扭转，直至断裂声如战舰炮击般响起。

"_That was dull, I didn't even have to use berserk mode."_  
“真无聊，我连暴走模式都没用上。”

Shinji felt himself slowly blacking out as he had lost to much blood. "At least its over."  
真嗣感到自己逐渐失去意识，失血过多。“至少，一切都结束了。”

"_For now at least."_  "至少目前如此。"

---

"This constant cycle of bleeding and healing is going to affect him."  
"这种持续的流血与愈合循环会对他产生影响。"

"How bad?" "有多严重？"

"I can't say for sure but he seems to heal surprisingly quickly, which worries me since it could be a side effect of being in that Eva."  
"我不敢肯定，但他似乎恢复得异常快，这让我担心，因为这可能是驾驶那台 Eva 的副作用。"

"Do you really think its that bad."  
"你真的认为有那么糟糕吗？"

"Judging by the fact that Rei couldn't pilot it I can assure you that it's very different."  
"鉴于丽无法驾驶它这一事实，我可以向你保证，它非常不同。"

"I suppose...at least it didn't go berserk."  
"我想...至少它没有发狂。"

"No, Shinji seemed to be more in control that last time, but still far from a decent sync. At times he far out passes Asuka's records and at times he barely meets the minimum sync levels."  
"不，真嗣这次似乎更能控制自己了，但离良好的同步率还差得远。有时候他远远超过明日香的记录，有时候却勉强达到最低同步率。"

"Any ideas?" "有什么想法吗？"

"None." "没有。"

Misato sighed, "Thanks Ritsuko for all the help."  
美里叹了口气，"谢谢你，律子，帮了这么多忙。"

"No problem, he shouldn't be in any immediate danger though so when he gets up you should be able to go home."  
"没事，他应该没有立即的危险，等他醒来后你们就可以回家了。"

"Thanks again." “再次感谢。”

Ritsuko simply waived a hand as she walked out of the hospital room.  
律子只是挥了挥手，便走出了病房。

Several minutes later Shinji felt his eyes open slowly. It felt like they had been crusted shut.  
几分钟后，真嗣感到自己的眼睛缓缓睁开，感觉像是被粘住了一样。

"Shinji you're awake!" "真嗣，你醒了！"

It took Shinji several minutes to figure out who was talking then...  
真嗣花了好几分钟才弄清楚是谁在说话……

"Misato?" "美里？"

"Yeah how do you feel."  
"嗯，你感觉怎么样。"

"Sore, like I had needles drilled into me."  
"疼得像被针钻进去一样。"

"Well, you did have the Eva's nerves connected with yours."  
"嗯，你的神经确实和 Eva 的连接在一起了。"

"Yeah..." "是啊..."

"So ready to go home."  
"终于可以回家了。"

Shinji looked up hopefully, "I can leave."  
真嗣满怀希望地抬头，"我可以走了。"

"Yeah, nothing's wrong with you so we can leave whenever."  
"是啊，你没事了，我们随时都可以离开。"

"Okay, yeah I'm ready." "好的，是的，我准备好了。"

Shinji got out of bed and changed quickly while Misato waited by the door.  
真嗣迅速起床更衣，美里则在门口等候。

"All ready then?" "那么，都准备好了吗？"

Shinji nodded. 真嗣点了点头。

"Good, I'm sure Asuka is wanting food right about now."  
"好，我相信明日香现在一定饿了。"

Shinji felt a little sweat dripped from his chin then. He had forgotten about Asuka.  
真嗣感到一滴汗珠从下巴滴落。他忘了明日香。

---

Shinji had thought that he had finally gotten used to Misato's driving but he had to look back at the drive home as he walked into the apartment clutching his stomach.  
真嗣本以为自己终于习惯了美里开车的方式，但当他走进公寓，手捂着肚子时，不得不回想回家的那段车程。

"About time," said an angry voice.  
“终于回来了，”一个愤怒的声音说道。

Shinji looked up to see Asuka in short blue shorts and a pink tank-top standing in front of the door with her foot tapping impatiently.  
真嗣抬头一看，只见明日香穿着蓝色短裤和粉色背心，站在门前，不耐烦地用脚敲打着地面。

"Do you have any idea how hungry I've gotten waiting for you."  
"你知道我等你等得有多饿吗？"

"Gomen Asuka, I didn't want to wake Shinji up."  
"对不起，明日香，我不想吵醒真嗣。"

"Whatever I want something for dinner, now."  
"无所谓，我现在想吃晚饭了。"

Even though she still hadn't said anything to him since she left earlier or looked at him for that matter, he took this as an indirect way of asking him to make dinner.  
尽管她自从早些时候离开后还没对他说过任何话，甚至也没看他一眼，但他把这当作是间接让他准备晚餐的请求。

"Yeah, I'll get right on it."  
“好的，我马上就去弄。”

"But Shinji you just got out of the hospital, surely-"  
“但是真嗣，你刚出院，肯定——”

"Its fine Misato." “没事的，美里。”

Asuka meanwhile had retreated to the couch and turned on the T.V. and turned the volume up so she couldn't here Shinji whistling in the kitchen.  
与此同时，明日香已经退到沙发上，打开了电视，并把音量调高，这样她就听不到真嗣在厨房里吹口哨的声音了。

It was probably the first time since they all three started to live together that not a word was spoken at the dinner table. Shinji for the most part kept to himself and only talked when addressed, but Asuka and Misato talked a lot. Not today.  
自从他们三人开始同居以来，这可能是第一次晚餐桌上没有一个人说话。真嗣大部分时间都保持沉默，只在被问到时才开口，但明日香和美里通常话很多。今天却不同。

The air itself seemed to be unsocial and half way through dinner Asuka couldn't take any more of it and stood up, planting both palms on the table, and walked over to the living room with her half eaten plate.  
空气中似乎弥漫着不和谐的气息，晚餐进行到一半时，明日香再也忍受不了，猛地站起身来，双手撑在桌上，端着只吃了一半的盘子走向客厅。

When Asuka finally left Shinji stopped playing with his food and asked Misato. "Err, is she angry that I killed he angel and not her?"  
当明日香终于离开后，真嗣停止了玩弄食物，向美里问道：“呃，她是不是因为我杀了使徒而不是她而生气？”

Misato shrugged, "No idea."  
美里耸了耸肩，“不知道。”

Sighing Shinji pushed his half eaten plate of food away from himself and walked into the living room.  
叹了口气，真嗣将只吃了一半的盘子推开，走进了客厅。

Predictably Asuka was watching something in German and taking up the whole couch. Shinji stood there for several seconds, listening to whatever she was watching and was about to turn around when a harsh voice said, "What do you want?"  
不出所料，明日香正在看德语节目，占据了整个沙发。真嗣站在那里几秒钟，听着她正在看的内容，正要转身离开时，一个严厉的声音问道：“你想要什么？”

Shinji looked over his shoulder to see Asuka still looking at the T.V. even though she had just asked him a question.  
真嗣回头一看，只见明日香仍然盯着电视，尽管她刚刚问了他一个问题。

Shaking his head he said, "Why are you mad at me."  
他摇摇头说：“你为什么生我的气？”

"Because you're a baka, plain and simple."  
“因为你就是个笨蛋，简单明了。”

"You tell me I'm an idiot at least twice a day, if not more, its something more important than that."  
“你每天至少两次说我是个白痴，如果不是更多的话，这次是比这更严重的事。”

"Fine then, I'm angry that you left the house and then started fighting the angel without giving a thought about it."  
"好吧，我生气了，你离开家后就开始和天使战斗，根本没考虑过后果。"

"Asuka I didn't have a choice, it just happened in front of me. It's not like I wanted that to happen."  
"明日香，我别无选择，它就发生在我面前。又不是我想要这样的。"

"Baka!" "笨蛋！"

"Whatever, be that way. You're too stubborn as it is."  
“随你怎么说，你本来就固执得要命。”

As Shinji turned away he heard the shifting of something and next second heard a crash as something exploded over his head.  
当真嗣转身离开时，他听到了什么东西移动的声音，下一秒就听到头顶上传来爆炸声。

Being careful not to step on the broken plate he turned around to see a red faced, angry Asuka glaring poisonously back at him.  
他小心翼翼地避开破碎的盘子，转过身来，看到满脸通红、怒气冲冲的明日香正恶狠狠地瞪着他。

"DON'T YOU DARE ACT LIKE YOUR THE ONLY ONE THAT DOESN-" Asuka got a hold of her feeling then as she realized that she'd be making herself vulnerable.  
"你敢装作只有你一个人在受苦——" 明日香控制住了自己的情绪，随即意识到自己正变得脆弱。

Shinji meanwhile was looking curiously back at her, unsure what to make of this sudden outburst and subsequent retreat.  
与此同时，真嗣好奇地回头看着她，不明白这突如其来的爆发和随后的退缩意味着什么。

"If it makes you feel any better I'm sorry, for whatever I did. Now I'm going to bed, night."  
"如果这能让你感觉好些，我道歉，无论我做了什么。现在我要去睡觉了，晚安。"

Shinji then turned and walked down the hall leaving Asuka alone in the living room. Biting her lip slightly she slumped back down into the couch cushions and thought, 'Sorry, you could have died. Baka!'  
真嗣随后转身沿着走廊走去，留下明日香一人在客厅。她轻轻咬着嘴唇，又瘫坐在沙发垫上，心想：‘对不起，你本可能死掉的。笨蛋！’

### Chapter 5: Understanding  
第五章：理解  

**Well as I said I'd get this done a lot earlier then the last four month wait time...and here it is. I think this is the shortest chapter I've done so far for Spawn of Adam, though they wont get shorter than this. Anyway I'm going to yellowstone for ten days and they've got internet there. So hopefully I'll get some typing done while there. Also something I forgot to mention in the last chapter, I made a ShinjiXAsuka amv and put it on youtube. I originally made it back in January but only got around to posting it last month. So if you like Breaking Benjamin (song is Diary of Jane) then you'll probably like this. Ja Ne  
正如我所说，我会比上次四个月的等待时间提前完成这个章节……现在它来了。我认为这是迄今为止《亚当之子》中最短的一章，尽管不会再比这更短了。无论如何，我将去黄石公园十天，那里有互联网。所以希望在那里我能完成一些打字工作。另外，我在上一章忘记提到，我制作了一个真嗣 X 明日香的视频并上传到了 YouTube。我原本在一月份就制作好了，但直到上个月才发布。所以如果你喜欢 Breaking Benjamin（歌曲是《简的日记》），那么你可能会喜欢这个。再见**

---

"Get up, and make our lunches," said an angry voice from his door.  
“起床，给我们准备午餐，”一个愤怒的声音从他的门口传来。

Shinji rolled over and grumbled about it being to early before Asuka planted her bare foot directly on his face.  
真嗣翻了个身，咕哝着说时间还太早，结果明日香直接把她的赤脚踩在了他的脸上。

"Move it! You better not expect me to eat that shit they call food at school."  
快点！你最好别指望我吃学校里那些他们称之为食物的垃圾。

Pushing Asuka's foot off his face he glared at her briefly before resigning to her demands. Looked like she was still angry.  
他推开明日香的脚，短暂地瞪了她一眼，然后无奈地接受了她的要求。看来她还在生气。

Standing up quickly he pushed passed her and walked into the kitchen to start making their bento's. Shinji was somewhat surprised though that she didn't wake him up earlier to make breakfast. Though judging from the bowl of half eaten cereal on the kitchen table she wasn't particularly hungry.  
他迅速站起身，推开她走进厨房开始准备便当。这让真嗣有些惊讶，她竟然没有早点叫醒他做早餐。不过从厨房桌上那碗只吃了一半的麦片来看，她似乎并不怎么饿。

Sighing slightly, he turned towards the fridge and started assembling all the ingredients for the bento's.  
他轻轻叹了口气，转向冰箱，开始组装便当所需的所有食材。

Half an hour later, the two of them walked out the door with Asuka maintaing several yards in front Shinji. He didn't seem to mind it really though, if anything he was avoiding her as much as possible.  
半小时后，两人一前一后走出门，明日香保持着几码的距离走在真嗣前面。他似乎并不介意，甚至可以说，他尽可能地避免与她接触。

The day before, when Misato returned from Nerv, Shinji was told that if he continued to fight the angels then he would have to run tests while in the Eva. He wasn't thrilled by this but expected it nonetheless. Asuka seemed furious though and this seemed to just build on top of her new hate for Shinji. So after a hectic yelling match between the two she had hit him...hard, and stormed back to her room. So Shinji would only be more than happy to be able to ignore her for the rest of the day. Though that didn't seem to be the case as a sudden bout of nausea hit him and he felt his vision grow blurry until he passed out.  
前一天，当美里从 NERV 回来时，真嗣被告知如果他继续与使徒战斗，那么他必须在 EVA 中进行测试。他对此并不兴奋，但仍然有所预料。然而，明日香似乎非常愤怒，这似乎加剧了她对真嗣的新恨意。于是在两人之间爆发了一场激烈的争吵后，她狠狠地打了真嗣一拳，然后怒气冲冲地回到自己的房间。因此，真嗣非常乐意能在当天剩下的时间里无视她。然而，这似乎并不可能，因为他突然感到一阵恶心，视线变得模糊，直到他昏倒。

---

'Really this is starting to get annoying,' he thought to himself as he watched himself walking out the door of Misato's apartment with Asuka slightly in the lead. It was a replay of what had just happened to him. He watch from above as two of them walked, with her always slightly in the lead.  
“真的，这开始变得烦人了，”他一边看着自己走出美里公寓的门，明日香稍稍领先，一边心想。这是刚刚发生在他身上的事情的重演。他从上方看着两人行走，她总是稍稍领先。

After several minutes of this he was starting to get bored when everything changed. It looked like he was watching an extremely sped up tape on a VCR. He watched as he entered school and spent most of the time slouching in his chair with his eyes half open, glancing out the window occasionally.  
经过几分钟这样的情景，他开始感到无聊，直到一切都发生了变化。仿佛在观看一台 VCR 上极度加速的录像带。他看到自己走进学校，大部分时间都懒散地坐在椅子上，眼睛半睁，偶尔瞥向窗外。

Next they were walking out of the doors to school and seemed to be on their way to the Nerv testing facilities. Except that somebody else was with them. Shinji couldn't tell who it was though and this puzzled him. It was like a gray human like shape was walking in between him and Asuka. Why bother showing the gray shape if he couldn't even see the person. At least he thought it was a person.  
接着，他们走出学校大门，似乎正前往 NERV 的测试设施。只是，有另一个人和他们在一起。真嗣看不清是谁，这让他感到困惑。一个灰色的类人形身影走在他和明日香之间。既然他连那个人都看不清，为什么还要展示这个灰色身影呢？至少他认为那是个人的形状。

When they arrived at Nerv a security personal paused from a moment to check their idea and then let them through. After that Shinji got brief flashes of things that happened in the facilities. He saw as he changed in what Misato had called a plug suit. It seemed to be black, blue and white. He saw himself taking a deep breath before walking into the entry plug of Eva Unit 01. He saw all three of the Evas lined up, including the blue and orange one.  
到达 NERV 时，一名安保人员停顿片刻检查他们的身份，然后放行。之后，真嗣短暂地看到了设施内发生的一些事情。他看到自己换上了美里所说的插入栓服，似乎是黑、蓝、白三色。他看到自己深吸一口气，走进了 EVA 初号机的插入栓。他看到三台 EVA 并排站立，包括那台蓝橙相间的机体。

After that almost nothing. He saw a few brief flashes of things that happened afterwards. It looked like him and Asuka had another fight and he was left standing in the road with a red mark on his cheek. After this everything went blurry and he suddenly felt himself falling, and falling into nothingness.  
自那之后，几乎一片空白。他瞥见了几幕后续的片段。似乎是他和明日香又吵了一架，他独自站在路上，脸颊上留着一道红印。此后一切变得模糊，他突然感到自己在坠落，坠入无尽的虚空。

---

"Wake up, damn it!" “快醒醒，该死的！”

Shinji felt somebody hitting him hard at the side of his head and opened his eyes slowly, just as Asuka was about the backhand him again.  
真嗣感到有人重重地击打他的头部一侧，他缓缓睁开眼睛，正好看到明日香准备再次反手打他。

It was curious how he reacted. Before her hand was about to strike him he caught it with surprising speed that he didn't even know he possessed. With a glazed look over his eyes as though he was stilling falling through the blackness he looked up at Asuka. It was hard to tell what her expression was, most of it seemed to be angry but Shinji thought he sensed a tiny bit of worry, though he didn't expect her to say it in words.  
他的反应颇为耐人寻味。在她即将打中他之前，他以惊人的速度抓住了她的手，连他自己都没想到能有这样的反应。他的眼神迷离，仿佛仍在那片黑暗中坠落，他抬头看向明日香。很难判断她的表情，大部分似乎是愤怒，但真嗣觉得他察觉到了一丝担忧，尽管他不指望她会用言语表达出来。

"Let go of me ass-hole."  
“放开我，混蛋。”

Wrenching her hand out of his grip she glared at him slightly before snarling. "What the fuck was that about?"  
她用力挣脱他的手，稍稍瞪了他一眼，随即咆哮道：“你他妈刚才那是什么意思？”

Shinji would have dearly liked to retort back something similar but kept his cool and said. "Nothing, just anticipation for today's tests."  
真嗣本想狠狠回敬一句，但还是保持了冷静，说道：“没什么，只是对今天的测试有些期待。”

"No amount of tests will improve you, baka."  
“再多的测试也改变不了你，笨蛋。”

Shinji ignored her comment, stood up calmly, and grabbed his bag which lay discarded on the sidewalk. Turning around briefly he glanced at Asuka briefly who seemed somewhere torn between loathing and spite, which didn't make a difference in Shinji's opinion.  
真嗣无视了她的评论，平静地站起身，拿起被丢在人行道上的书包。他转头短暂地瞥了一眼明日香，她似乎在厌恶和怨恨之间挣扎，但在真嗣看来，这并没有什么区别。

Turning back around he started walking forward at a slow pace when he felt something hard hit his shoulder and a flash of red moved past him. Rubbing his shoulder where she had punched him he looked ahead and was unsurprised that she had widened the distance between them.  
他转过身，开始以缓慢的步伐前行，忽然感到有什么硬物击中了他的肩膀，一道红影从他身边掠过。他揉着被她打中的肩膀，抬头望向前方，对于她拉大了彼此间的距离并不感到意外。

"Does she always have to act so superior to everyone?" He mumbled before walking at the same pace that he had been moving at moments before.  
“她总是要表现得比所有人都高人一等吗？”他低声嘀咕着，继续保持着之前那段时间的步伐。

---

School was still a nightmare but one thing seemed to have changed. Kensuke seemed to respect Shinji a little because of what he said at the shelters. Even Touji didn't seem like a jerk as much, but he kept up with it mainly because everyone else did.  
学校依旧如噩梦般，但似乎有一件事发生了变化。因为他在避难所说的话，健介似乎对真嗣多了几分尊重。就连东治也不再那么像个混蛋了，不过他主要还是因为大家都这么做而继续保持。

When Shinji walked into class that day he was unsurprised to see Asuka already sitting in front of his desk looking determinedly out the window. Ignoring this he walked over to his desk and was about to sit down when he stopped in the middle of sitting. Next to Asuka was a girl with blue hair, the same from the day before.  
那天，当真嗣走进教室时，看到明日香已经坐在他的桌前，坚定地望着窗外，他并不感到意外。他无视这一点，走到自己的桌前，正要坐下时，却在半空中停住了。在明日香旁边，有一个蓝头发的女孩，正是前一天见过的那位。

She gave no inclination that she recognized Shinji, in fact, from his view, she seemed to not even know where she was. A vague, blank expression was on her face as she continued staring at the chalk bored. Shinji noticed, without perverted intentions, that she seemed to be holding herself different, as though she was in discomfort. Then he remembered the large wound that she had suffered and was about to open his mouth when a slight snarl came from across the room.  
她没有表现出任何认出真嗣的迹象，实际上，从他的角度看，她似乎连自己在哪里都不知道。她的脸上带着一种模糊而空洞的表情，继续盯着黑板。真嗣注意到，没有不正当的意图，她似乎在以不同的方式支撑着自己，仿佛感到不适。然后他想起了她所受的重伤，正要开口时，教室另一边传来了一声轻微的咆哮。

"Shinji, are you going to stand there forever or can you sit so I can get on with teaching."  
“真嗣，你是打算一直站在那里，还是能坐下来让我继续上课？”

Several of the kids snickered as Shinji threw his teacher a scowl and sat behind Asuka who at that moment didn't know who she hated more: Shinji or the First Child.  
有几个孩子窃笑起来，真嗣瞪了老师一眼，坐在了明日香后面，那一刻她不知道自己更恨谁：真嗣还是第一适任者。

While school was still something he loathed he found it easier to get through the day. He even started to attracted less unpleasant remarks from the other students, which he thought might have a lot to do with living with Asuka. Seemed many of the boys had finally found out what she was really like and lost interest in her, which seemed to annoy her. After all her complaining about every guy wanting to get in bed with her she was getting annoyed by the lack of attention. Shinji then snorted at the thought of this as he sat down up on the school roof. Classes had just been dismissed for lunch and Shinji didn't have an appetite right now. Last thing he needed was to hurl during his first test.  
尽管学校依然是他所厌恶的地方，但他发现日子变得容易熬过去了。他甚至开始少受其他学生的恶言恶语，他认为这可能与和明日香同住有很大关系。似乎许多男生终于发现了她的真面目，对她失去了兴趣，这似乎让她很恼火。毕竟，她一直在抱怨每个男人都想和她上床，而现在她却因为缺乏关注而感到恼火。真嗣想到这里，嗤之以鼻，他坐在学校屋顶上。刚放学去吃午饭，真嗣现在没有胃口。他最不需要的就是在第一次考试中呕吐。

After several minutes of laying there Shinji thought that he could hear two distinct voices coming up the stairwell. Sitting up just in time he saw the door flung open and bounce off against the wall only to be kicked again. Touji walked disgruntled out into the open with a slight tense Kensuke behind him.  
躺了几分钟后，真嗣觉得他能听到楼梯间传来两个不同的声音。他及时坐起来，看到门被猛地推开，撞到墙上又被踢了一脚。东治一脸不悦地走了出来，紧随其后的是略显紧张的健介。

'So much for peace and quiet,' thought Shinji.  
“看来平静的日子是没戏了，”真嗣心想。

Surprisingly though they didn't seem to want to pick on him as Kensuke walked up to Shinji and said rather hurriedly.  
然而出乎意料的是，他们似乎并不想找他麻烦，健介快步走向真嗣，急匆匆地说道。

"Hey...umm, I'm sorry for everything that I...we've ever done to you." Touji acted as though he wasn't listening. Kensuke continued.  
“嘿...呃，对于我们对你做过的所有事情，我...我们感到很抱歉。” 透治表现得好像没在听一样。健介继续说道。

"And I was just hoping that we could put our past differences aside and well..." Kensuke then put out his hand in front of Shinji and gave something close to a bow.  
"我刚才只是希望我们能放下过去的分歧，嗯……" 随后， Kensuke 伸出手，向真嗣微微鞠了一躬。

Shinji wasn't sure whether to laugh, rebuke him, or shake his hand. Never being good any stuff like this he scratched the back of his head and said, "Oh...yeah." Grabbing his hand rather uncertain of himself he shook Kensuke's hand who responded by sitting down next to Shinji and opening his lunch box.  
真嗣不确定是该笑，还是该责备他，或是握手。对于这种事情他一向不擅长，于是挠了挠后脑勺，说："哦……嗯。" 他有些犹豫地握住了 Kensuke 的手，而 Kensuke 则顺势坐在真嗣旁边，打开了便当盒。

"Want some?" "要来点吗？"

Shinji shook his head, "Best not to."  
真嗣摇了摇头，"最好别这样。"

Kensuke shrugged and went back to eating. It appeared that even Touji's still apparent annoyance of Shinji could not even deter him from eating as he sat down next to Kensuke and plowed into his own lunch. Even though Shinji didn't want to admit it he was glad that he had finally made a friend, well there was Asuka, but that varied.  
健介耸了耸肩，继续吃他的饭。看来，即使是对真嗣依然明显的恼怒，也无法阻止他吃饭。他坐在健介旁边，大口吃着自己的午餐。虽然真嗣不想承认，但他很高兴自己终于交到了一个朋友，嗯，还有明日香，但那关系时好时坏。

"Hey Shinji I was wondering," said Kensuke between bites.  
"嘿，真嗣，我在想，"健介边吃边说。

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

"What happened to you after we left you at that shelter."  
"我们把你留在那个收容所后，你发生了什么事？"

Its a good thing that Shinji wasn't eating anything or he would have just gone into a choking fit. This was the least thing that he expected Kensuke to ask. Stuttering slightly he said, "Oh I wandered around before I found a shelter."  
幸好真嗣没在吃东西，否则他可能会呛到。这是他最没想到健介会问的问题。他稍微结巴了一下，说道：“哦，我四处流浪了一阵子，然后找到了一个避难所。”

"Did you here about the rumor that have been going around town lately?"  
"你听说了最近城里流传的那些谣言吗？"

"Err what rumors?" Shinji had an idea but wasn't about to say it.  
"什么谣言？" 真嗣心里有数，但并不打算说出来。

"That underneath Tokyo-3 is a secret military organization and that it conducted a test yesterday. Thats why the city had to be under isolation."  
"说东京-3 地下有一个秘密军事组织，昨天进行了测试。这就是为什么城市必须处于隔离状态。"

Shinji let out a sigh of relief.  
真嗣松了一口气。

"And that they supposedly tested some giant robot."  
"据说他们测试了某种巨型机器人。"

Shinji sigh seemed to be sucked back in as Kensuke's words hit his ears. "Err, know. I didn't hear that," he said sheepishly.  
听到 Kensuke 的话，Shinji 的叹息仿佛被吸了回去。“呃，不知道。我没听说过，”他有些尴尬地说。

"It seems to be a big story, I just wonder how much is true. Oh what I would give to get a picture of one."  
"这听起来像是个大新闻，我只是好奇有多少是真的。哦，要是我能拍到一张照片就好了。"

Shinji thought it was time to steer the conversation away from dangerous waters and said quiet bluntly without meaning to. "Who is that blue haired girl that just showed up today?"  
真嗣觉得是时候把话题从危险的水域引开了，于是不经意间直截了当地问道：“今天刚来的那个蓝发女孩是谁？”

Kensuke looked puzzled for a minute before snickering slightly and smiling at Shinji. "I thought I caught you looking at her, what outgrew Asuka already?"  
剑介困惑了一会儿，随即轻笑起来，对着真嗣微笑道：“我就知道你注意到她了，这么快就对明日香没兴趣了？”

Shinji was slightly annoyed, more for the fact of suggesting him and Asuka having sex then him interested in the blue haired girl.  
真嗣有些不悦，更多的是因为剑介暗示他和明日香有性关系，而不是他对蓝发女孩感兴趣。

Passing it off he said, "I'd never live through it. No I was just curious is all. I've been here for almost a month now and I just noticed her today. Has she been here always?"  
他推脱道：“我可受不了那种事。不，我只是好奇罢了。我在这里已经快一个月了，今天才注意到她。她一直都在这儿吗？”

Kensuke shrugged, "Yeah but she seems to disappear for a while and then just comes back one day. Sometimes she's injured, other times she's fine. No idea what's up with her. She keeps to herself and hardly talks to anyone."  
健助耸了耸肩，“是啊，但她似乎会消失一段时间，然后某天又突然回来。有时她受伤了，有时又安然无恙。不知道她怎么回事。她总是独来独往，几乎不和任何人说话。”

"So what's her name then?"  
“那她叫什么名字？”

"Err...Ayanami Rei, I think."  
"呃...我想是绫波零。"

"Ayanami Rei?" "绫波零？"

"Yeah, its the first time I can remember seeing her in a few months."  
"是啊，这是我这几个月来第一次记得见到她。"

Shinji couldn't think of anything to say at this point and lapsed into silence. So her name was Ayanami Rei and she was also an Eva pilot. Chances are then that he'd see her later again.  
此时，真嗣想不出该说什么，便陷入了沉默。原来她的名字是绫波零，也是一位 EVA 驾驶员。那么，他很可能会再次见到她。

Kensuke appeared to be done with his lunch and Touji had finished his in record time. Standing up Kensuke said, "I guess I'll see you in class then, Shinji."  
健司似乎已经吃完了午餐，而阿薰更是以创纪录的速度解决了他的那份。站起来后，健司说道：“那我们课堂上见，真嗣。”

"Yeah cya," said Shinji who was absorbed in his own thoughts.  
“嗯，再见。”真嗣沉浸在自己的思绪中，随口应道。

After the two stooges left Shinji flung himself on his back as he looked up at the clouds. Reflecting back on what had happened the past week his life had definitely taken a turn, but in which direction. Compared to what it used to be he supposed that it was better. He had a decent home with a nice roommate...and a not so nice roommate, well usually. And he had started to get used to peoples company.  
在两个笨蛋离开后，真嗣仰面躺下，望着天上的云朵。回想起过去一周发生的事情，他的生活无疑发生了转变，但转向何方呢？与过去相比，他觉得现在好多了。他有了一个不错的家，和一个好室友……以及一个不那么好的室友，嗯，通常情况下。而且，他开始习惯了与人相处。

Though everything bad that he had seen, the Eva, angels, the visions, the damn visions. What in the hell we're they really? Premonitions about the future, or events that may or might not happen, and why him? What did he do to make this happen to himself? A book certainly couldn't tell Shinji what he wanted to know.  
尽管他看到了所有糟糕的事情，EVA、使徒、那些该死的幻象。它们到底是什么鬼东西？关于未来的预感，还是可能发生或不发生的事件，为什么是他？他做了什么让自己遭遇这些？一本书当然无法告诉真嗣他想知道的。

Then there was Eva Unit 01, his Eva he supposed, as it wouldn't let anyone else pilot it but him. It was obviously different then the other Eva's but in what way. Did the others hear a voice every time they got in that entry plug? Did they connect physically and mentally with the Eva every time they piloted it? Shinji rather doubted it.  
还有 EVA 初号机，他觉得那是他的 EVA，因为它只允许他一个人驾驶。它显然与其他 EVA 不同，但具体是哪里不同呢？其他人每次进入驾驶舱时也会听到声音吗？他们每次驾驶时都能与 EVA 在身体和精神上建立联系吗？真嗣对此相当怀疑。

"To many questions," he mumbled out loud to nobody but himself. Or at least he thought.  
“太多问题了，”他喃喃自语，除了自己别无他人。或者至少他是这么认为的。

"Does it hurt," asked a calm voice?  
“疼吗？”一个平静的声音问道。

Shinji almost had a heart attack as he bolted upright. Standing several feet in front of him was Ayanami Rei and once again she had a passive look on her face.  
真嗣差点吓得心脏停跳，猛地坐直了身子。站在他几英尺外的是绫波零，她的脸上再次露出了那种淡漠的表情。

Shinji gaped openly for a second or to and then closed his mouth. He had an urge to say something funny but couldn't quite get his tongue to wrap around them.  
真嗣张口结舌了一会儿，然后才闭上了嘴。他有种想说些俏皮话的冲动，但舌头就是不听使唤。

"Hey what's up?" He asked in a feeble attempted at a conversation.  
“嘿，怎么了？”他试图展开对话，语气却显得无力。

She continued to look passively back at him without any sign of emotion. Shinji was starting to get annoyed.  
她继续面无表情地看着他，没有任何情绪的迹象。真嗣开始感到烦躁。

Sitting up he said, "Look, if you don't have anything to say then I'm heading back to class."  
他坐起身来说道：“听着，如果你没什么要说的，那我就回教室了。”

Shinji then pushed himself up and walked past her. At first he thought that she was going to stop him and he hesitated for a fraction of a second, but then continued walking past her. However when he was about to reach for the door nob to take him to the stairwell she finally opened up.  
随后，真嗣站起身来，从她身边走过。起初他以为她会拦住他，犹豫了那么一瞬间，但随即继续向前走去。然而，当他伸手准备开门去楼梯间时，她终于开口了。

"Are you going to continued piloting Eva?"  
“你还会继续驾驶 EVA 吗？”

Shinji wheeled around and was unsurprised to see that she still hadn't moved but was still standing in the same place, as though he had never moved. He was starting to get used to her weirdness.  
真嗣转过身来，并不意外地发现她依旧站在原地，仿佛他从未移动过。他开始习惯了她的古怪。

Wrenching open the door he paused in front of it and said, "Yeah."  
他用力拉开那扇门，在门前停顿了一下，说道：“嗯。”

Glancing briefly at her he didn't see any sign of change and let out a sigh. Had he been expecting something? Ignoring the thought he started walking back towards class.  
他匆匆瞥了她一眼，没发现任何变化，便叹了口气。他是否期待着什么？他没去多想，开始往教室走去。

The minute that Shinji walked into class Asuka threw him a dirty scowl, which he saw but ignored it. She could be so childish sometimes. However several seconds later her scowl intensified, as Shinji was walking back towards his desk, when Rei walked into the classroom. Asuka's imagination started to buzz rapidly as she thought of reasons why they were mere moments apart from walking into the class room. None of the conclusions she came up with satisfied her.  
真嗣一走进教室，明日香就朝他投去一个厌恶的眼神，他看到了却置之不理。她有时真是幼稚得可以。然而几秒钟后，她的怒容愈发加深，因为真嗣正走向自己的座位时，丽走进了教室。明日香的思绪开始飞速旋转，她想找出他们前后脚进教室的原因。但她想到的任何结论都无法令自己满意。

---

Many hour later school ended and Shinji was almost grateful, or would have been if he didn't have to climb into an Eva.  
许多小时后，学校终于放学了，真嗣几乎感到庆幸，如果不是还得爬进 Eva 的话，他本该如此。

The walk to Nerv was uneventful to say the least. He was right in assuming that Rei was a regular Eva pilot as she seemed to be going the same way as he and Asuka. Though it seemed that Asuka was determined that she was the leader as she continued to speed up every once in a while.  
前往 NERV 的步行至少可以说是不出所料的平静。他猜对了，丽确实是一名常规 Eva 驾驶员，因为她似乎和真嗣及明日香走的是同一条路。尽管明日香似乎决心要当领头人，时不时地加快步伐。

Shinji was nervous and it showed. His eyebrows were sweating and he was starting to bite his lip. He had a sudden urge then to ask Asuka some things about the tests that he would be going through soon. Speeding up, he was still determined though to stand far enough back so that he would be able to avoid a punch from her if she got angry. Still unsure if this was even smart he opened his mouth and said, "Hey Asuka can I ask you something?"  
真嗣显得很紧张，这一点显而易见。他的眉头冒着汗，开始咬起了嘴唇。他突然有种冲动，想向明日香询问一些关于即将进行的测试的事情。他加快了脚步，但仍决心保持足够的距离，以防她生气时能避开她的拳头。尽管不确定这样做是否明智，他还是张开嘴说道：“嘿，明日香，我能问你点事吗？”

She ignored him like he thought. It was worth a shot, but he still had an idea.  
她像他预想的那样无视了他。虽然值得一试，但他还有个主意。

Laying the respect on a bit thick he said, "Asuka please, you've been doing this a lot longer than I have. I want to know what to expect from these tests since you've had much more experience than I have."  
他略显夸张地表达着敬意，说道：“明日香，请告诉我，你比我有更长的经验。我想知道这些测试会有什么，毕竟你比我经验丰富得多。”

Shinji was counting on Asuka's pride as an Eva pilot that she would answer his questions. It seemed to work.  
真嗣寄希望于明日香作为 EVA 驾驶员的骄傲，相信她会回答他的问题。看来这招奏效了。

She glanced behind at him quickly with a frown on her face as though still unsure if she was angry at him or not. 'Oh what the hell. I do have the best combat record,' she thought.  
她迅速回头瞥了他一眼，眉头紧皱，似乎还在犹豫自己是否还在生他的气。'管他呢，我的战斗记录可是最好的，'她心想。

"The tests are simple enough, at least most of them. Today will be nothing more than a synchronization test."  
“这些测试很简单，至少大部分是。今天不过是同步率测试而已。”

"And what does that mean?" Shinji didn't want to ask to much and anger her so he thought to ask the basics only.  
"那是什么意思？" 真嗣不想问得太多而激怒她，所以他只问了最基本的问题。

"For an idiot like you it means nothing more than becoming used to being in the entry plug."  
"对你这样的傻瓜来说，这不过意味着习惯了进入插入栓而已。"

Shinji wanted to throw back a retort but thought better and bit his tongue, at least they were talking now.  
真嗣本想反驳，但转念一想还是咬住了舌头，至少现在他们开始交谈了。

"So we won't be doing any simulations?"  
"所以我们不进行任何模拟训练吗？"

"No! You won't be for a while. You're barely able to synchronize with your Eva. It'll take you months to get to the level that I'm at."  
"不！你暂时不会进行。你与 Eva 的同步率还很低。要达到我现在的水平，你需要几个月的时间。"

"And what about Rei?" "那丽怎么样？"

Asuka's mood turned sour at her name and spun around and Shinji was glad that he had maintained a good distance between them as she looked like she was ready to hit him.  
听到自己的名字，明日香的心情顿时变糟，她转过身来，真嗣庆幸自己和她保持了足够的距离，因为她看起来像是要揍他。

"What about her!" “她怎么了！”

"Nothing, I just wondered how long she had been a pilot is all."  
“没什么，我只是好奇她当驾驶员多久了。”

Asuka glared at him before turning around and stomping off, "Ask her yourself you dumb ass!"  
明日香瞪了他一眼，然后转身跺脚离去，“你自己问她啊，你这个笨蛋！”

Shinji was left standing still on the sidewalk with a frown on his face. 'So much for the brief minutes of talking,' he thought before catching up to her slightly.  
真嗣站在人行道上，眉头紧锁。‘短暂的交谈就这样结束了，’他想着，然后稍微加快脚步追上了她。

Shinji was thoroughly glad that he had Asuka and Rei with him, he would never be able to find his way in Nerv. All the crisscrossing hallways made him nauseous. Then he remembered that his father was somewhere in this mess and felt like puking even more.  
真嗣非常庆幸有明日香和绫波在他身边，否则他绝对无法在 NERV 里找到路。那些纵横交错的走廊让他感到恶心。接着他想起父亲也在这片混乱之中，更觉得想吐了。

---

After what seemed like an hour they walked into a room similar to the one that Shinji had been in previously. Except this one had a window that showed the three Eva's lined up next to each other waiting for there pilots. Shinji guess that this is where they would be syncing. Next second it was confirmed when he heard a familiar voice.  
仿佛过了一个小时，他们走进了一个与之前真嗣待过的类似的房间。只是这个房间有一扇窗户，窗外排列着三台 EVA，它们并排等待着各自的驾驶员。真嗣猜测这里就是他们进行同步的地方。下一秒，这个猜测就被一个熟悉的声音证实了。

"Glad you could make it Shinji."  
“很高兴你能来，真嗣。”

Shinji turned around to see a smiling Misato standing in front of him.  
真嗣转过身，看到米萨托站在他面前，面带微笑。

Shinji grinned, but it was rather strained. Misato seemed to notice this and said, "Don't worry you'll be fine."  
真嗣勉强笑了笑，但显得有些僵硬。美里似乎注意到了这一点，说道：“别担心，你会没事的。”

"Yeah..." "是啊..."

"Everything is ready so just go change into your plug suits and we can get this over with."  
“一切都准备好了，快去换上插入栓服，我们尽快搞定这件事。”

Asuka and Rei seemed to understand her words because they left through a door to the left leaving Shinji standing there confused.  
明日香和绫波似乎理解了她的意思，因为他们穿过左边的一扇门离开了，留下真嗣站在那里一脸困惑。

"Err Misato, what do you mean by plug suits?"  
"Misato 小姐，你说的插入栓服是什么意思？"

Misato let out a small oh as if she had forgotten something, which she did. "I completely forgot that you haven't even piloted in a plug suit before which is surprising. It shows your potential as a pilot."  
Misato 轻声‘哦’了一下，仿佛忘记了什么，她的确忘了。“我完全忘了你之前连插入栓服都没穿过，这真是令人惊讶。这显示了你作为驾驶员的潜力。”

Shinji wasn't sure that was a complement or not so just let her continue.  
真嗣不确定这是不是在夸他，所以只是让她继续说下去。

"Anyway take that door at your right in the far corner and find a locker that says Shinji on it. I think the number was 203, or something."  
“总之，走到右边的角落，那扇门进去，找一个标有‘真嗣’的储物柜。我想号码是 203，或者是别的什么。”

"But what is a plug suit?"  
“但什么是插入栓服？”

Misato frowned, "I knew that you and Asuka hadn't been getting along but I assumed that she'd explain some things to you."  
美里皱眉道：“我知道你和明日香相处得不好，但我以为她会向你解释一些事情。”

"I really hadn't tried, its better to let her cool off instead of forcing her to."  
"我真的没试过，让她冷静一下比强迫她要好。"

"Well, anyway, in simple terms the plug suit synchronizes you with your Eva. However the fact that you are able to sync with your Eva...by other methods means that maybe you wont have to use one. This is still all just tests. Oh and there be some blue clips in their also, put those on your head."  
"总之，简单来说，插入栓服能让你与 EVA 同步。不过，既然你能通过其他方法与 EVA 同步，或许你就不必使用它了。这一切都还在测试阶段。哦，还有，里面会有一些蓝色夹子，把它们戴在头上。"

Shinji tried to keep all this in his head, as he followed Misato's instructions.  
真嗣努力记住这一切，同时按照美里小姐的指示行动。

After several annoying minutes of getting used to the fabric which was unbearably tight after pressing a button he found that Misato had failed to mention Shinji walked out of the boys locker room, clipping the nerve receptors onto his head.  
经过几分钟令人烦躁的适应，那布料紧得让人难以忍受，他按下了一个按钮，发现美里忘记告诉他的事情——真嗣走出了男更衣室，将神经感受器夹在头上。

Shinji had admit-tingly thought that Asuka was cute when he had first seen her, and had realized that she was even more attractive now that he got to know her, this however blew him away. He hadn't even thought about the fact that she would be wearing a plug suit also and it hit him like a piano when he saw her in the bright red plug suit. It complemented her curves precisely and there was no lack of anything. He considered himself not overly perverted but this pushed the limits.  
真嗣不得不承认，第一次见到明日香时，他就觉得她很可爱，而现在了解她之后，他发现她更加迷人了，但这完全让他震惊。他甚至没想过她也会穿插入栓服，当看到她穿着鲜红色的插入栓服时，这感觉就像一架钢琴砸中了他。那紧身衣完美地衬托出她的曲线，没有任何不足之处。他自认不算过于好色，但这确实超出了他的极限。

Asuka must have caught him gaping openly because she tossed her hair behind her head and seemed to give a seducing smile towards him. This pulled Shinji out of his stupor and he had to curse himself slightly for his stupidity. It was obvious that she had been expecting this kind of reaction from him and was throughly enjoying it.  
明日香肯定注意到了他目瞪口呆的样子，因为她把头发甩到脑后，似乎对他露出了一个诱人的微笑。这让真嗣从恍惚中回过神来，他不得不暗自咒骂自己的愚蠢。显然，她早就预料到他会这样反应，并且乐在其中。

Determinedly wrenching his eyes away from her they instead settled on Rei. Her plug suit was more or less the same as his except more white while his was largely blue.  
他坚决地移开视线，不再看她，转而注视着丽。她的插入栓服和他的大致相同，只是白色部分更多，而他的则主要是蓝色。

Misato appeared to witness this whole ordeal and let it continue until things seemed to pass.  
美里似乎目睹了整个过程，任其继续，直到一切似乎都过去了。

"Now then you know what to do...Shinji just follow the girls and ask if you have any questions."  
“那么，你知道该怎么做...真嗣，跟着女孩们走，有任何问题就问。”

'Not like I'll get them answered if I ask,' he thought bitterly as he stared at Asuka's back.  
“问了也不会得到回答的。”他苦涩地想着，目光凝视着明日香的背影。

---

'So far so good,' Shinji thought as he finished strapping himself in to Eva Unit 01. Looking at the monitor he saw that Asuka and Rei had done likewise. Suddenly Misato's voice came over on the loud speaker.  
“目前为止一切顺利。”真嗣想着，完成了对 EVA 初号机的固定。他看向屏幕，发现明日香和绫波也已经准备就绪。突然，美里通过扩音器传来了声音。

"OK everything is ready on our end. Go ahead and start concentrating you guys. I want to get this done as quickly as possible."  
“好了，我们这边已经准备妥当。你们开始集中精神吧。我希望尽快完成这件事。”

Shinji assumed that she was worried about him and rather thankful at that. Gathering everything that he could remember during his past fights in the Eva he closed his eyes and solely concentrated on something he never thought he would, syncing with the voice that had plagued his dreams.  
真嗣猜测她是在担心他，并且对此颇为感激。他集中精力，回忆起过去在 EVA 战斗中的点点滴滴，闭上眼睛，全神贯注于一个他从未想过会去关注的事物——与那个困扰他梦境的声音同步。

Almost immediately he heard a small whisper and soon it developed into a strong voice.  
几乎立刻，他听到了一个微弱的低语，很快这声音变得强烈起来。

"_Glad your finally getting the time to get to know me better."_  
“很高兴你终于有时间更好地了解我了。”

Shinji was quiet as he didn't want anything to interfere with his thought process.  
真嗣保持沉默，不想让任何事情干扰他的思考过程。

"_Thats rather rude, ignoring me like that. What, did your parents never teach you any manners?"_  
“那样无视我真是太没礼貌了。怎么，你父母没教过你礼貌吗？”

Something sparked in Shinji's mind, but he was quickly able to pass it off. However it was noticed in the command room.  
真嗣脑海中闪过一丝念头，但他很快就能将其抛诸脑后。然而，这一细微变化在指挥室中被察觉到了。

"Anomaly detected in Unit 01."  
"发现 01 号单元异常。"

Misato immediately spun in the direction of the voice and barked. "What is it?"  
美里立刻转向声音的方向，厉声问道：“怎么回事？”

"Wait...nothing, it disappeared."  
"等等……没事了，它消失了。"

Misato frowned worriedly and said, "Keep an eye on Unit 01 and let me know if anything changes."  
美里皱着眉头担忧地说：“盯紧零号机，有任何变化立刻通知我。”

"Yes ma'am!" “是的，女士！”

Back in Unit 01 Shinji was starting to sweat from concentrating, that and the voice was really starting to get on his nerves.  
回到零号机内，真嗣因为集中精神而开始出汗，再加上那个声音真的开始让他烦躁起来。

"_So ready for the next angel attack? I know I am. Just let me know and I'll rip it to shreds. What I wouldn't give for a good blood bath right now."_  
“准备好迎接下一个使徒了吗？我知道我准备好了。告诉我，我会把它撕成碎片。我现在多么渴望好好洗个血浴啊。”

"Shut...it," whispered Shinji.  
"闭...嘴，" 真嗣低声说道。

"_Here I am trying to strike up a conversation with you and thats all you can say, phish, ass."_  
"我在这里努力想和你聊聊天，你就只能说这些，真是的，笨蛋。"

Shinji then started to talk to the voice deep in his subconscious. "Okay fine, we'll talk."  
真嗣随后开始与深藏在他潜意识中的那个声音对话。"好吧，好吧，我们聊聊。"

"_Good, because its boring if you don't."_  
"很好，因为如果你不这样做，那就太无聊了。"

"What or who are you?"  
"你是什么，或者你是谁？"

"_The thing that lives inside of the Eva."_  
"住在 Eva 里面的那个东西。"

Shinji was startled by this new streak of information and it showed with his sync ratio.  
这条新信息让真嗣吓了一跳，这从他的同步率中显露无遗。

Gaining control of his thoughts he said, "What do you mean the thing that lives inside the Eva?"  
他控制住自己的思绪，说道：“你说的‘住在 Eva 里的东西’是什么意思？”

"_Those humans don't tell you much do they."_  
“那些人类没告诉你多少，是吧。”

Shinji didn't want to admit it but the voice was right. "I never asked, but what are you."  
真嗣不想承认，但那个声音是对的。“我从没问过，但你是什么？”

"_An entity, thats good enough for now."_  
“一个存在，目前这样就足够了。”

"Fine, why me?" “好吧，为什么是我？”

"_You intrigue me, simple enough. You're different then all the other humans that have ever piloted me. At first I thought about killing you but after looking inside of your soul I learned a few things about you that made me curious."_  
"你引起了我的兴趣，就这么简单。你和其他所有曾经驾驶过我的人类都不同。起初我想过要杀掉你，但在窥视你的灵魂之后，我发现了关于你的几件事，让我感到好奇。"

"And those things are?" "那些事是什么？"

"_Stuff that you wouldn't want to know. Put it this way, your better of not knowing."_  
"你不会想知道的那些事。这么说吧，不知道对你更好。"

"And if I still want to know?"  
"如果我仍然想知道呢？"

"_Most likely you'll go insane from it and thats not happening anytime soon. I need you sane, so don't even ask."_  
"最有可能的是，你会因此发疯，而且这不会很快发生。我需要你保持理智，所以别再问了。"

"Fine then do you have anything to do with the visions that I am having. Ever since I pilot you the first time I've been having visions of people that I know or events that may or not happen. I damn sick of them."  
"好吧，那你和我的那些幻觉有关系吗？自从我第一次驾驶你以来，我就一直在看到我认识的人或可能发生的事件。我他妈的受够了这些。"

"_I can't control things that happen outside of this small space, so I have no idea what your babbling about."_  
"我无法掌控这个小空间之外的事情，所以你说的那些我一无所知。"

"Fine, thanks for nothing."  
"好吧，谢了，啥也没帮上。"

"_Anytime."_ "随时乐意。"

Shinji lapsed into silence as he felt his conscious slide back to where he currently was. Opening one of his eyes he glanced at a screen to his right and saw Asuka with her eyes closed doing the same thing that he was doing. Unable to hold back the smirk after getting another look at her red plug suit he turned away quickly so as to not interrupt his concentration.  
真嗣陷入了沉默，他的意识逐渐回到了当前所在之处。他睁开一只眼睛，瞥向右侧的屏幕，看到明日香闭着眼睛，做着和他一样的事情。再次看到她那红色插入栓服后，他忍不住露出了微笑，但很快又转过头去，以免打断自己的专注。

Then, the pain hit him. Shinji felt like his mind was going to split down the middle as reality was torn from him. Flashes passed him as he saw a dark room with the walls lit up in red, a sea the color of blood, his mother who he could barely remember smiling back at him before she turned into a creature with no face. Nothing was real and everyone was gone. It was just Shinji inside the entry plug of Eva Unit 01 screaming like he was wounded.  
随后，疼痛袭来。真嗣感觉自己的意识仿佛要被撕裂，现实从他身边被剥离。闪回的画面掠过眼前：一个黑暗的房间，墙壁被红色照亮，一片血色的海洋，他几乎记不清的母亲微笑着回头看他，随即变成了一只没有面孔的生物。一切都不真实，所有人都消失了。只剩下真嗣在 EVA 初号机的插入栓内，像受伤一样尖叫。

Misato reacted quickly at the first sound of Shinji's screams. "Disengage the umbilical cords for all three Eva's, and get Rei and Asuka out of there as quickly as possible. Status of Eva Unit 01?"  
听到真嗣的尖叫声，美里迅速做出反应。“立即断开三台 EVA 的脐带电缆，尽快将绫波和明日香带出来。初号机的状态如何？”

"Pilot live signs are fluctuating abnormally. The LCL fluid inside the entry plug is heating up, passing normal temperatures...critical reached."  
"驾驶员生命迹象异常波动。插入栓内的 LCL 液体温度升高，超过正常值...已达到临界点。"

"Entry plug removal for Unit 00 and Unit 02 have been confirmed, pilots safe."  
"零号机与二号机的插入栓已确认移除，驾驶员安全。"

"Get them the hell out of there! Try removing the entry plug for Unit 01."  
"立刻把他们带出来！尝试移除初号机的插入栓。"

"Negative it will not recognize the signature."  
"负面的，它无法识别签名。"

Misato bit her nail in fear. When someone alerted her of something important.  
美里紧张地咬着指甲。当有人向她报告重要事情时。

"Commander Misato you might want to look at this."  
"美里指挥官，您可能需要看看这个。"

"What," she snapped. "什么，"她厉声道。

"Its Unit 01's sync rate."  
"这是 01 号机的同步率。"

Misato was over there in a flash and froze when she saw the synchronization between the pilot and the Eva. It was fluctuating from plus one hundred to negative one hundred something that had never been seen before.  
Misato 瞬间冲了过去，当她看到驾驶员与 Eva 之间的同步率时，整个人都僵住了。同步率从正一百波动到负一百多，这种从未见过的现象让她震惊不已。

In a shaky voice Misato managed to get the words out, "Record this...for future reference."  
美里用颤抖的声音勉强说出：“记录下来……以备将来参考。”

"Yes ma'am." “是，长官。”

Getting a hold of her feelings for Shinji who's screams had subsided she looked back at the screen where his life signs were unknown.  
她努力控制住对真嗣的情感，他的尖叫声已经平息，她回头看向屏幕，那里显示着他的生命迹象未知。

"Does Unit 01 appear to be going berserk."  
"初号机似乎要暴走了。"

"It does not appear to be so."  
"看起来并非如此。"

Misato bit her nail again and said, "Get a team down there to restrain the Eva, and if you see any signs of movement get the hell back here. I don't want anyones life in danger."  
美里再次咬了咬指甲，说道：“派一支队伍下去制服 Eva，一旦发现任何动静，立刻撤回来。我不想任何人冒生命危险。”

At this moment Asuka came bursting into the command room with Rei behind her with a somewhat passive look.  
就在这时，明日香猛地冲进了指挥室，身后跟着表情略显被动的绫波。

"What the hell is going on, why did you call of the tests!"  
“到底怎么回事，为什么取消了测试！”

Misato did not want to deal with this right now and ignored Asuka who was not happy about it.  
美里现在不想处理这些，她无视了不满的明日香。

"Misato what is going on!"  
"美里，这是怎么回事！"

"Shinji's life is currently in danger and we are trying to recover him, that is the current situation!"  
"真嗣的生命现在处于危险之中，我们正在设法救他，这就是目前的状况！"

Asuka was slightly taken back as Misato had never snapped at her like that before. Her mood changed from one to anger to one of slight worry. "Is he okay?"  
明日香有些惊讶，因为美里以前从未这样对她发过脾气。她的情绪从愤怒转变为一丝担忧。"他没事吧？"

"I don't know but the last reading we got the temperature in Unit 01 was well over one hundred twenty degrees Fahrenheit. Since then its most likely climbed. Then...then there's his syncro rate. At times it was in the negatives which is supposed to be impossible and then it would jump up to a hundred which is equally impossible. Its like the Eva wants to kill him but is having second thoughts."  
"我不知道，但上次我们测得 01 号机内的温度已经超过了一百二十华氏度。从那以后很可能还在上升。然后...然后是他的同步率。有时会降到负值，这本应是不可能的，然后又会突然飙升到百分百，同样是不可能的。就好像 Eva 想要杀了他，却又犹豫不决。"

All Asuka could mange was a slight, "Oh." Finding a nearby chair she let herself sink into it and look up at the monitor which was fuzzy.  
明日香只能勉强发出一声轻微的“哦”。她找到附近的一把椅子，让自己沉入其中，抬头看着那模糊的显示屏。

Turning back towards the problem Misato said on the loud speaker, "How does it look down there?"  
米莎托转回面对问题，通过扩音器说道：“下面情况怎么样？”

"Nothing's wrong, Unit 01 is showing no signs of moving, proceeding with containment and the rescuing of the pilot."  
“一切正常，初号机没有任何动静，继续进行收容并营救驾驶员。”

Misato let out a strangled sigh and sank into a seat near her. Soon it would be all over and they'd be able to brush it off as a minor incident. But she knew it wasn't the case this time. If the Eva continued to do this to Shinji then she wouldn't be able to sit by and watch it.  
美里发出一声窒息般的叹息，瘫坐在她旁边的座位上。很快这一切就会结束，他们可以将其视为一个小插曲抛诸脑后。但她知道这次情况不同。如果 Eva 继续这样对待真嗣，她无法袖手旁观。

After several tense minutes of praying that nothing would go wrong the team on the floor managed to manually extract the entry plug from the Eva. LCL fluid poured from the open entry plug and Misato stood up and almost rushed down to the floor.  
在紧张地祈祷了几分钟后，地面上的团队终于手动从 Eva 中取出了插入栓。LCL 液体从打开的插入栓中涌出，美里站起身来，几乎要冲下楼去。

"We've got him, he's unconscious but miraculously alive."  
"我们抓到他了，他昏迷不醒但奇迹般地还活着。"

Misato let out a strangled sigh and suddenly felt like having several beers. It had been to close.  
美里发出一声哽咽的叹息，突然很想喝几杯啤酒。刚才真是太险了。

"There's something though, while the LCL was close to two hundred degrees in there his body is oddly cold. The only thing the LCL fluid seemed to destroy was his plug suit."  
"不过有件事很奇怪，尽管 LCL 温度接近两百度，他的身体却异常冰冷。LCL 液体似乎只破坏了他的插入栓服。"

"So what he's naked?" "他光着身子又怎么了？"

"...Well, yeah." "...嗯，是啊。"

Misato could have almost laughed. "Take him to the emergency room. I'll have doctor Akagi be ready for you when you get there."  
美里几乎要笑出声来。“带他去急诊室。我会让赤城医生准备好，等你们到了那里。”

Slouching deeper in her chair she spun around in her chair to see Asuka sitting there with her legs drawn up to her chest.  
她懒洋洋地陷进椅子里，转过身来看到明日香坐在那里，双腿蜷缩到胸前。

"Well he's okay," smiled Misato.  
“他没事，”美里微笑着说。

Asuka nodded in a forlorn sort of way. Misato had an idea though that might perk her up a little.  
明日香有些沮丧地点了点头。不过美里有个主意，或许能让她振作一点。

"Though I have no idea why, but he was for some reason naked in the entry plug when they found him. The LCL fluid burned off just the plug suit but his body was quite cold."  
虽然不知道为什么，但他们在插入栓里发现他时，他不知为何一丝不挂。LCL 液体只烧掉了插入栓服，但他的身体却异常冰冷。

Asuka's face turned a small shade of pink before she stood up and said, "Why the hell are you telling me something as disgusting as that. As if I'd want to know...how he was."  
明日香的脸微微泛红，然后站起来说：“你干嘛告诉我这么恶心的事。好像我想知道他怎么样似的……”

Misato let out the first smile since since the whole ordeal and stood up. "Well, lets at least be sure that he is completely okay before we start celebrating."  
美里在这场风波后第一次露出微笑，站起身来。“好吧，至少在我们开始庆祝之前，先确保他完全没事。”

Asuka snorted but followed her all the same.  
明日香哼了一声，但还是跟了上去。

---

"This is...familiar." “这地方……似曾相识。”

Shinji sat up in his hospital bed and felt his temples sear with pain. Whatever had happened it he couldn't remember anything. He remembered he had just taken a peek at Asuka before he blacked out. Now he was in a hospital room, naked, with a few chairs around his bed and his sheets bearing signs that someone had been sitting on them.  
真嗣在医院的病床上坐起身，感到太阳穴一阵剧痛。无论发生了什么，他都记不起来了。他只记得自己刚刚瞥了一眼明日香，然后就失去了意识。现在他躺在医院的病房里，一丝不挂，床边散落着几把椅子，床单上还留有被人坐过的痕迹。

"Looks like you finally woke up Shinji."  
"看来你终于醒了，真嗣。"

Shinji shifted so that he was facing the door and saw Ritsuko leaning against the wall with a cigarette in her hand.  
真嗣挪动身体，让自己面对着门，看到律子靠在墙上，手里夹着一支烟。

Shinji's first intentions where to ask what happened but Ritsuko beat him to it.  
真嗣本想问发生了什么，但律子抢先了一步。

"Don't worry about what happened, your safe and everybody's fine. You've been through a lot and are lucky to be alive. I'm keeping you here for two days at least to be sure. But I suppose I shouldn't badger you anymore, someone's been bothering me every few minutes to see if your awak-"  
"别担心发生了什么，你很安全，大家都没事。你经历了很多，能活下来真是幸运。我至少要留你在这里两天确保一切无恙。不过我想我不该再打扰你了，每隔几分钟就有人来问我你是否醒了……"

With that Ritsuko was pushed to the side as Misato darted into the room with a rather reluctant looking Asuka and a passive Rei in tow.  
说完这话，律子被推到一旁，美里冲进房间，身后跟着一脸不情愿的明日香和表情平静的丽。

"Shinji! Oh thank God you're okay. I knew it was a bad idea to have you do the tests."  
"真嗣！哦，感谢上帝你没事。我就知道让你去做那些测试是个坏主意。"

"Misato calm down, I'm fine."  
"美里，冷静点，我没事。"

"But you almost weren't, everyone was worried."  
"但你差点就出事了，大家都担心得要命。"

Shinji raised an eyebrow and looked over at Asuka who glared at him as though daring him to ask if she had been worried.  
真嗣挑了挑眉，看向明日香，她瞪着他，仿佛在挑衅他敢不敢问她是否也担心了。

"Glad that everyone was worried."  
"很高兴大家都这么担心。"

"Yes, well, I'm going to go ahead and have the commander pull you off of Unit 01. Its apparent that no one is able to handle it."  
"是的，好吧，我打算让指挥官把你从 01 号单位撤下来。显然没人能驾驭它。"

"No, I'm going to continue piloting it."  
"不，我要继续驾驶它。"

A long silence filled the room at Shinji's words. Misato was dumbfounded, even Asuka seemed to be surprised. Only Rei showed signs of knowing about his decision all along.  
在真嗣的话语落下后，房间里弥漫着长久的沉默。美里目瞪口呆，就连明日香也似乎感到惊讶。只有丽表现出早已知晓他决定的样子。

"But Shinji after what almost happened to you...I can't possibly put you inside that thing. What if something similar happens while in a battle."  
“但是，真嗣，经历了几乎丧命的危险后……我怎么可能再让你进入那东西里。万一战斗中发生类似的事情怎么办？”

Shaking his head Shinji said, "And what happens if you need help. I'm the only person who's ever been able to pilot it, besides I'm supposed to be dead now so for the fact that I survived I should be the pilot."  
真嗣摇摇头说：“如果你们需要帮助怎么办？我是唯一能驾驶它的人，而且我本该已经死了，既然我活了下来，我就应该成为驾驶员。”

Misato opened her mouth to argue again but Shinji cut her off. "I'm sorry Misato but I don't want it any other way. I want to help all I can and if piloting an Eva is what I can do I'll do it.  
美里张嘴还想争辩，但真嗣打断了她。“对不起，美里，但我不想有别的选择。我想尽我所能帮助大家，如果驾驶 Eva 是我能做到的，那我就去做。”

"Enough with the sympathy already," said an irritated Asuka. "He's healed and stubborn once again, can we leave now?"  
“别再同情了，”明日香不耐烦地说，“他已经痊愈又固执起来了，我们现在可以走了吗？”

"Don't act like you weren't worried Asuka," smirked Misato.  
“别装得你没担心过似的，明日香，”美里得意地笑道。

Asuka blinked, "Not a chance. Why would I worry about him?"  
明日香眨了眨眼，“没门儿。我干嘛要担心他？”

Shinji frowned at Asuka but ignored it. She'd always be the same, well he'd open up if she ever did.  
真嗣对明日香皱了皱眉，但没理会。她总是这样，如果她愿意敞开心扉，他也会的。

Misato sighed and said, "Fine we'll head home for now, but be back later with some fresh cooking. Hospital food can get sickening quickly."  
美里叹了口气说：“好吧，我们先回家，但晚点会带着新鲜烹饪的食物回来。医院的食物很快就会让人反胃。”

Asuka suddenly realized that she'd have to survive two days without Shinji to cook for her. Glaring at him in an annoyed sort of way as though it was his fault he was injured she mouthed, "Get well soon, or I'll be dead of food poisoning before you get back."  
明日香突然意识到，她得在没有真嗣做饭的情况下熬过两天。她恼怒地瞪着他，仿佛是他受伤的错，然后无声地说：“快点好起来，不然你回来之前我就要死于食物中毒了。”

Shinji smiled and mouthed, "Will do," back.  
真嗣微笑着，无声地回应：“会的。”

Asuka's face seemed to twitch slightly as she appeared to be working up the power for a smile. Though halfway through it turned into more of a grimace at which point she turned around quickly and stormed out of the room.  
明日香的脸似乎微微抽搐了一下，她似乎在努力挤出一个微笑。但笑到一半变成了苦笑，于是她迅速转身，气冲冲地走出了房间。

Misato and Shinji frowned at her but both started laughing silently. Regaining control of herself Misato said, "Don't pay to much attention to what Asuka says Shinji, she was worried, just didn't want to show it."  
美里和真嗣对她皱了皱眉，但两人都默默地笑了起来。美里恢复了镇定，说道：“别太在意明日香说的话，真嗣，她只是担心，只是不想表现出来。”

"I've long since realized that."  
“我早就意识到了。”

"Well, you seem fine so no point in taking anymore time. I'm sure Ritsuko will want to run some more tests on you so I won't get in her way anymore."  
“嗯，你看起来没事了，再花时间也没意义。我相信律子会想再给你做些检查，我就不再妨碍她了。”

"Thanks, Misato." "谢谢你，美里。"

"Don't worry about it. I am your guardian after all."  
"别担心。我毕竟是你的守护者。"

That ment a lot to Shinji but he wasn't about to say that. He still had trouble expressing his feelings sometimes.  
这对真嗣意义重大，但他并不打算说出口。他有时仍难以表达自己的情感。

"I'll see you later today then, with dinner."  
"那我们今天晚些时候见，一起吃晚饭。"

Shinji tried to not look sick, "Okay I'll be waiting."  
真嗣努力不让自己看起来想吐，“好的，我会等着。”

When Misato left the room Shinji was about to roll onto his side and fall back asleep when he realized that not everyone had left the room.  
当美里离开房间后，真嗣正要翻身继续睡，却意识到并非所有人都离开了房间。

"Why did you decide to continue piloting it," asked Rei?  
“你为什么决定继续驾驶它？”绫波问道。

Shinji sat up slowly and looked at her curiously. Since he had met Ayanami Rei he had only ever seen her talk to himself. Shrugging Shinji said, "I don't know. I feel like I'll regret it if I don't do something I guess."  
真嗣缓缓坐起身，好奇地看着她。自从遇见绫波零以来，他只见过她对自己说话。真嗣耸耸肩说：“我不知道。我觉得如果我不做点什么，我会后悔的。”

"So you're doing because you want to, not because other people have told you to."  
“所以你这么做是因为你想做，而不是因为别人叫你做。”

Shinji replied slowly, "Yes other people have asked me to but its still my decision to pilot it."  
真嗣缓缓回答：“是的，虽然别人请求过我，但驾驶它仍然是我的决定。”

"Are you sure about that?"  
"你确定吗？"

"I'm me. How can I not be sure about the things that I decide?"  
"我就是我。我怎么可能不确定自己决定的事情呢？"

Rei then lapsed into silence as though not sure how to continue.  
丽随后陷入了沉默，仿佛不确定如何继续。

"If your done with questioning me I'd be thankful if you left so I can get some sleep."  
"如果你问完了，我感激你离开，让我能睡一会儿。"

Rei looked at him curiously for a second and then quietly excused herself from his room.  
丽好奇地看了他一眼，然后悄悄地离开了他的房间。

Shinji then rolled over onto his side and closed his eyes. However whenever he would he saw the horrible things that were shown to him in the entry plug. He ended up not sleeping that night.  
真嗣随后侧身躺下，闭上了眼睛。然而，每当他试图入睡时，驾驶舱里看到的可怕景象就会浮现在他眼前。那一晚，他彻夜未眠。

### Chapter 6: Past and Present  
第六章：过去与现在  

Shinji was released from the hospital earlier then expected as he had recovered surprisingly quickly and he didn't show any signs of mental contamination. So Misato quickly ran home and dropped him off before rushing back to Nerv saying that she'd be working late again and to worry about making enough food for her.  
真嗣比预期更早出院，因为他恢复得惊人地快，并且没有表现出任何精神污染的迹象。于是，美里急忙跑回家把他放下，然后又匆匆赶回 NERV，说她又要工作到很晚，并叮嘱他为她准备足够的食物。

Shinji was rather hesitant as he stood outside of Misato's apartment. He hadn't talked to Asuka since he had been admitted to the hospital and was worried if she'd blow up in his face. Though he was saved the need to as the door came flying open and almost hit him in the face.  
真嗣站在美里小姐的公寓外，显得颇为犹豫。自从他住院以来，还没和明日香说过话，担心她会突然发火。然而，他还没来得及敲门，门就猛地被撞开，差点撞到他的脸。

"About time your back, I though I was going to die."  
“你总算回来了，我还以为我要死了呢。”

Shinji looked up and turned his head quickly as he got a glimpse of Asuka who was in nothing but a red towel. Shinji tried desperately not to think about her in her plug suit then. Asuka however noticed him turn away quickly and looked down at herself apparently just realizing what she was wearing.  
真嗣抬头迅速瞥了一眼，只见明日香只裹着一条红色毛巾。他拼命不去想她穿着插入栓服的样子。然而，明日香注意到他迅速转过头去，低头看了看自己，显然是刚刚意识到自己穿了什么。

"Ah never seen a girl this close to being naked? Turns you on a little doesn't it?"  
"啊，没见过女孩穿得这么少吗？是不是有点让你心动了？"

Shinji didn't want to admit that what she said was true so he just pushed past her. "Just get dressed already, I don't know what you're thinking opening the door while wearing nothing but a towel."  
真嗣不想承认她的话是真的，所以他只是推开她。“快点穿好衣服，我不知道你在想什么，只裹着一条毛巾就开门。”

"If it wasn't you or Misato I would have simply kicked them in the balls, course I might do the same to you anyway."  
“如果不是你或美里，我早就一脚踢过去了，当然，对你我可能也会这么做。”

Shinji whipped around and faced her. Asuka was rather startled but stood her ground. "What!"  
真嗣猛地转过身面对她。明日香颇为吃惊，但还是站稳了脚跟。“什么！”

Shinji glared at her for a moment but sighed and said, "Sorry, I'm just a little agitated is all."  
真嗣瞪了她一会儿，然后叹了口气说：“对不起，我只是有点烦躁而已。”

"I suppose I'd be annoyed too if I had to stay two days stuck in that damn hospital room. Anyway I'm sick of take out food and microwaved meals, I want some real food."  
“我想如果我得在那个该死的医院房间里呆上两天，我也会很烦的。不管怎样，我吃腻了外卖和微波炉食品，我想吃点真正的食物。”

"Hai, I'll get started." "嗨，我这就开始。"

"Good, and don't-" "好，还有别——"

"No way in hell would I peek, just move it!"  
"地狱里都没门我会偷看，快挪开！"

Asuka was startled by his outburst and slightly rebuked herself for egging him on. Shrugging she let it drop and walked into her room.  
明日香被他的爆发吓了一跳，暗自责备自己不该激他。她耸耸肩，不再追究，走进了自己的房间。

"Well, I suppose its adequate to say the least," said Asuka as soon as she finished Shinji's cooking which consisted of her favorite: Sauerkraut.  
“好吧，至少可以说还算过得去。”明日香一吃完真嗣做的饭就说道，那里面有她最喜欢的酸菜。

Shinji almost snorted. He knew that it was more then adequate and that she had almost been starving herself for two days.  
真嗣差点笑出声来。他知道那不仅仅是过得去，她几乎已经饿了两天。

"When is Misato supposed to be home anyway," asked Asuka?  
"Misato 到底什么时候该回家来着？" 明日香问道。

"No idea. Late tonight I think."  
"不知道。我想应该是今晚很晚吧。"

"Great, well no way am I going to stay here with you."  
"太好了，那我可不打算和你一起待在这儿。"

"Fine, leave for all I care."  
“好啊，你走吧，我才不在乎。”

Asuka hadn't really been serious when she had said that she was leaving, she just wanted to see what Shinji's reaction would have been. Though from his reaction she guessed that he really didn't care and was slightly hurt by that.  
明日香当时说离开并不是认真的，她只是想看看真嗣会有什么反应。但从他的反应来看，她猜他真的不在乎，这让她有点受伤。

"Fine! If you don't care then I will leave!"  
“好！既然你不在乎，那我就走！”

Standing up abruptly she let her plate fall to the floor and storm off to her room where she tossed on a red sweatshirt with a hood.  
她猛地站起来，任由盘子掉落在地，气冲冲地跑回房间，套上一件带帽子的红色运动衫。

Shinji had half a mind to stop her and was just about to say he was sorry when she stormed out of her room before pausing and throwing a dirty scowl in his direction. As she turned around Shinji lunged forward and grabbed her wrist and waited for her reaction as she turned slowly around.  
真嗣本想拦住她，正要开口道歉，她却已经冲出房间，临走前还狠狠地瞪了他一眼。当她转身时，真嗣向前一扑，抓住了她的手腕，等待着她的反应，她缓缓转过身来。

"Let go damn it!" “放开我，该死的！”

Shinji hesitated but let his grip slack, and she was able to wrench her wrist free of his hand. Rubbing her wrist in a confused sort of way she looked back at Shinji who had his eyes angled towards the ground.  
真嗣犹豫了一下，但松开了手，她得以挣脱他的掌握。她困惑地揉着手腕，回头看向真嗣，他正目光低垂，盯着地面。

'What was that,' she thought? 'He actually seemed strong.'  
'刚才那是怎么回事？'她心想，'他看起来真的很有力量。'

Ignoring her thought she said. "What, do you want to say something?"  
她没理会自己的想法，问道："怎么，你想说什么吗？"

Shinji opened his mouth and closed it, unsure of how he should proceed.  
真嗣张开了嘴又合上，不确定该如何继续。

"If your not going to say anything then I'm leaving!"  
“如果你什么都不打算说，那我就走了！”

"Wait...Asuka." “等等……明日香。”

Asuka had her hand on the door nob as he said this and paused trying to decide whether she should listen or ignore him. She didn't really want to leave if she was honest with herself. Turning around slowly she said, "I'm listening."  
明日香手握在门把手上，听到这话时停了下来，试图决定是该听还是无视他。老实说，她并不真的想离开。她缓缓转过身，说道：“我在听。”

Shinji fidgeted slightly before looking up at her hesitantly. "I'm sorry for snapping at you..."  
真嗣稍微扭动了一下，然后犹豫地抬头看向她。“我为刚才对你发火道歉……”

"What was that?" "那是什么？"

"I'm sorry okay! I didn't mean what I said about not caring. Truth is I do."  
“对不起，好吗！我刚才说的不是真心话，关于不在乎的那部分。事实上，我确实在乎。”

Asuka frowned at him for a second before walking past him. Shinji winced slightly as he thought that he was going to get hit as she walked by but opened his eyes when he realized that she had already walked past. Sighing in a reassuring way he almost jumped several feet in the air as he heard her whisper behind him, "Good, because I didn't want to in the first place."  
明日香皱着眉头看了他一秒，然后从他身边走过。真嗣在她经过时微微缩了一下，以为会被打，但睁开眼时发现她已经走过去了。他松了一口气，几乎跳了起来，因为她在他身后低声说：“好，因为我一开始就不想这么做。”

Shinji let out a reluctant smile that he hoped that she wouldn't see. Giving her a few seconds he just had time to see her walking into the living room throwing off the sweatshirt as she walked giving him a brief view of her bareback. Tossing these thoughts to the side he started walking towards the kitchen to clean up when he saw her poke her head into the hallway.  
真嗣露出了一个不情愿的微笑，希望她没看到。他给了她几秒钟时间，正好看到她走进客厅，边走边脱掉运动衫，让他瞥见了她的裸背。他把这些念头抛到一边，开始走向厨房准备清理，这时看到她探头进了走廊。

"Are you coming or what?"  
“你来不来？”

Shinji's face showed total confusion as he looked back at her. Asuka sighed in an annoyed sort of way and jerked her finger towards the living room.  
真嗣的脸上满是困惑，他回头看着她。明日香带着一种恼怒的语气叹了口气，用手指向客厅。

"I'm telling you to get over here. I don't care whether you watch what I'm watching or read a book, but I'm giving you the day off so forget about the dishes. Misato can clean then for once."  
“我叫你过来。我不在乎你是看我看的节目还是看书，但今天我给你放假，别管洗碗了。让美里自己打扫一次吧。”

Did Shinji hear that right? Did Asuka want to spend time with him actually?  
真嗣听对了吗？明日香真的想和他一起度过时间吗？

"Uh sure..." “呃，当然...”

As Shinji walked hesitantly into the living room he had to refrain from quickly peeking in. Most of the time when Shinji or Asuka were alone by themselves at home Asuka forbade Shinji from stepping into the living room. So he usually spent most of his time in his bedroom listening to his SDAT.  
当真嗣犹豫地走进客厅时，他不得不克制自己迅速偷看的冲动。大多数时候，当真嗣或明日香独自在家时，明日香禁止真嗣进入客厅。所以他通常大部分时间都待在自己的卧室里听他的 SDAT。

Asuka was sprawled on her back on the couch with her head tilted up looking at the T.V. She must have heard Shinji cause she sat up briefly and pointed to a spot on the floor. Shinji nodded and ran into his room to grab a book. While she was watching something that wasn't German it was still a Japanese soap opera.  
明日香仰面躺在沙发上，头向后仰看着电视。她一定是听到了真嗣的声音，因为她短暂地坐了起来，指着地板上的一个位置。真嗣点点头，跑回房间拿了一本书。尽管她看的不是德语节目，但仍然是一部日本肥皂剧。

Even though they were in the same room together, any forms of conversation was dropped dead when they were started. Neither were really sure what to say to the other as they were usually glaring at each other. Several times Shinji tried to ask her something but she either waved him off because it was an important part in her T.V. show or she frowned at him and ignored his question. Shinji was starting to wonder why he had even agreed to be in the living room with her.  
尽管他们同处一室，任何形式的对话一旦开始便戛然而止。两人都不确定该对对方说些什么，因为他们通常只是互相瞪眼。有好几次，真嗣试图向她提问，但她要么因为电视节目中的重要部分挥手让他走开，要么就皱着眉头无视他的问题。真嗣开始怀疑自己为何要同意和她一起待在客厅里。

Shinji was just starting to think of getting up when a question that he would never thought of normally hit his brain.  
真嗣正想着起身离开，一个他平时绝不会想到的问题突然闪过脑海。

"Um Asuka?" “呃，明日香？”

"Hmmm?" She was to fixated on her program to reply.  
"嗯？" 她过于专注于她的程序，以至于没有回应。

"What are your parents like?"  
"你的父母是什么样的人？"

Shinji could tell that it wasn't something she didn't enjoyed talking about as her entire body seemed to seize up. Attempting to fix what he just uttered he said, "I-I'm sorry. If you don't want to talk about it, its fine."  
真嗣可以看出这不是她喜欢谈论的话题，因为她的整个身体似乎都僵住了。试图弥补他刚才说的话，他说道："我……我很抱歉。如果你不想谈这个，没关系。"

Asuka slowly turned her head towards him and frowned at him. It wasn't one of her usually frowns which showed annoyance, it was more curious.  
明日香缓缓转头看向他，皱起了眉头。这不是她通常那种表示不悦的皱眉，而是带着更多的好奇。

"Why do you want to know?" She asked slowly.  
“你为什么想知道？”她缓缓问道。

Shinji hesitated, "I don't know...I've never really known what a family is like. I told you that my father moved me around from place to place, right."  
真嗣犹豫了一下，“我不知道……我从来没真正了解过家庭是什么样的。我告诉过你，我父亲总是把我从一个地方搬到另一个地方，对吧。”

Asuka thought about it for a minute and remembered what Shinji had told her after he pilot Unit 01 for the first time. She nodded.  
明日香想了一会儿，记起真嗣第一次驾驶初号机后告诉她的话。她点了点头。

"I don't have any idea what a family is like because my mother died when I was young. I don't even know what she looked like. I've never been shown pictures of her and my father doesn't seem to care. I was just told that she died in a lab accident. Misato is more of a mother than anyone I've ever known, though I suppose she can double as a father also, with all the beer she drinks."  
“我对家庭一无所知，因为我母亲在我很小的时候就去世了。我甚至不记得她的样子。从未有人给我看过她的照片，而父亲似乎也不在乎。我只被告知她死于实验室事故。美里比起我所认识的任何人更像一个母亲，尽管我想她也能兼任父亲的角色，毕竟她喝那么多啤酒。”

Asuka had to repress a smile at Shinji's words, though he noticed it anyway.  
听到真嗣的话，明日香不得不忍住笑意，尽管他还是注意到了。

"So I guess what I'm saying is I just want to know what a real family is like."  
“所以我猜我想说的是，我只是想知道一个真正的家庭是什么样的。”

There, back to the subject of her family. It was a subject that Asuka hated to discuss and had long since buried painful memories. Turning off the T.V. that she no longer had an urge to watch she looked back at Shinji and said, "I'd rather not talk about it."  
说到她的家庭，这是一个她讨厌讨论的话题，早已埋藏了痛苦的记忆。她关掉了不再想看的电视，回头看着真嗣说：“我不想谈这个。”

Shinji had expected this when he saw that she seemed to seize up, but was curious anyway.  
真嗣看到她似乎僵住了，就预料到了这一点，但仍然感到好奇。

"Thats okay, if you don't want to talk about it I can understand that."  
"没关系，如果你不想谈这件事，我能理解。"

"So you're mother is dead, and you consider Misato to be your mother."  
"所以你妈妈去世了，而你把美里当成妈妈。"

Shrugging Shinji said, "Compared to all the other roommates that I've ever known she is the most caring out of all them. Though that doesn't mean much as almost all of my other roommates were either partying or drunk."  
真嗣耸了耸肩说：“与其他我认识的室友相比，她是最关心人的一个。不过这也不算什么，因为我之前的室友几乎不是在聚会就是在醉酒。”

"So then what do you consider me as..."  
"那么你把我当成什么呢..."

Shinji was caught of guard for a moment and was unsure what to say. He had said that he considered Asuka a friend, the first that he had ever had. But fights between them seemed to break out continuously and it was hard to get along with somebody who seemed ready to kick you in the balls at any second.  
真嗣一时措手不及，不知该如何回答。他曾说过把明日香视为朋友，这是他人生中的第一位朋友。但两人之间似乎总是争吵不断，与一个随时可能踢你一脚的人相处实在不易。

Shrugging Shinji said, "I honestly don't know anymore."  
真嗣耸了耸肩，说道：“老实说，我现在真的不知道了。”

Asuka frowned, "And what is that supposed to mean?"  
明日香皱眉，“那是什么意思？”

"I told you that I considered you a friend, the first one I ever made."  
“我告诉过你，我把你视为朋友，是我第一个真正交到的朋友。”

"Yeah..." "是啊..."

"We fight so much that I don't know if we even are friends anymore."  
“我们争吵不断，我都不知道我们是否还算朋友了。”

Asuka looked at Shinji for a minute, confused at what he ment. "What do you mean?"  
明日香看着真嗣，困惑于他的意思。“你是什么意思？”

"Why are you always picking on me and calling me stupid!" Shinji blurted out. "Why do you always seem to put me down! Have you once cared about how I feel, no! Its all about you, its always been about you."  
“为什么你总是针对我，叫我笨蛋！”真嗣脱口而出。“为什么你总是贬低我！你有没有一次关心过我的感受，没有！一切都是关于你，一直都是关于你。”

Asuka was silent as Shinji let out all of his frustration about her attitude towards him. She didn't know what to say. It was just how she was. She had never worried about other people's feeling because nobody seemed to care about what she felt. Her own-  
真嗣将他对明日香态度的所有不满发泄出来，明日香沉默不语。她不知道该说什么。她就是这样的人。她从未担心过别人的感受，因为似乎没有人关心她的感受。她自己的——

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

"What!" He snapped back. "什么！" 他厉声回应道。

"I'd rather not argue with you right now."  
"我现在不想和你争论。"

"Who's arguing!" "谁在争辩！"

"Just shut it...please..."  
"只是闭嘴...请..."

It was the please more than anything that calmed Shinji down. He could never remember hearing her voice as soft as this, or the words please coming out of her mouth.  
正是这个“请”字，比什么都更能安抚真嗣。他从未记得她的声音如此柔和，或是从她口中听到“请”这个字。

Sitting up, he was about to return to his room as he knew that an outburst from the two of them was soon to follow but he was surprised when her words stopped him.  
他坐起身来，正准备回到自己的房间，因为他知道那两人很快就会爆发争吵，但她的言语却让他意外地停下了脚步。

"Wait, Shinji..." “等等，真嗣……”

Shinji looked over his shoulder to see Asuka sitting up with a meek expression on her face. "What," he said, but it was much calmer.  
真嗣回头一看，只见明日香坐起身来，脸上带着温顺的表情。“怎么了？”他问道，语气比平时平静许多。

Asuka leaned back into the couch cushions and bit her lip. "I-I...I'm sorry damn it."  
明日香向后靠在沙发垫上，咬了咬嘴唇。“我……我……该死，对不起。”

Shinji raised an eyebrow. "You...sorry?"  
真嗣挑了挑眉。“你……道歉？”

"Yes, is that so weird?"  
“是的，这很奇怪吗？”

"Actually yes, I've never heard you say you were sorry for anything."  
"实际上是的，我从没听你说过你为任何事感到抱歉。"

"Well, now you have." "好吧，现在你听到了。"

"And?" "然后呢？"

"And what!" “那又怎样！”

"What is that supposed to do? Your sorry, cool. Not like you can reverse everything that you've ever said or did to me."  
“那能有什么用？你道歉了，很好。但不像你能收回你对我说的或做的一切。”

Asuka had never received verbal abuse anywhere near close to what Shinji was dishing and felt like she was close to tears.  
绫波从未遭受过如此接近真嗣所施加的言语伤害，她感到自己快要哭了。

"Damn it Shinji, what do you want me to do!"  
"该死的真嗣，你到底想让我做什么！"

Shrugging he said, "I don't know. I really don't anymore."  
他耸耸肩说：“我不知道。我真的不知道了。”

"Tell me then ass-hole!" “那就告诉我，混蛋！”

"This is exactly what I mean. You give no regard to what other peoples feelings are."  
“这正是我的意思。你丝毫不顾及别人的感受。”

Asuka was slightly abashed but retorted back. "How do you even know what other people's emotion are? You've never had a friend in your life!"  
明日香略感尴尬，随即反驳道：“你怎么可能知道别人的情绪？你这辈子连个朋友都没有！”

Asuka flinched then as Shinji took several quick steps over to her and was fearful that he was about to hit her, or worse. Instead Shinji glared down at her and said, "I may not have many friends but I understand people a lot better than you."  
明日香一惊，只见真嗣快步走向她，她害怕他可能会打她，甚至更糟。然而，真嗣只是瞪着她，说道：“我或许朋友不多，但我比你更懂得人心。”

Shinji realized that he had gone to far then as Asuka looked tearfully back up at him. All the anger seemed to drain out of Shinji as he took a few steps back and sank to the floor. Asuka meanwhile laid back down on the couch and turned her body so that she was facing the couch.  
真嗣意识到自己做得太过分了，因为明日香泪眼汪汪地抬头看着他。所有的怒气似乎都从真嗣身上消失了，他后退了几步，瘫坐在地板上。与此同时，明日香又躺回了沙发上，转身背对着沙发。

After several minutes Shinji broke the silence by saying, "Sorry what I just said, it was rude." She responded by hiccuping slightly.  
几分钟后，真嗣打破了沉默，说道：“对不起，我刚才说的那些话，太粗鲁了。”她回应时微微打了个嗝。

After several painful moments of deciding whether to continue the conversation, Shinji was about to stand up when he saw that Asuka had beat him to it. Whether she had cried silent tears or whether she had already used them all up he wasn't sure, as her face was dry and looking at him. Seconds later Asuka motioned for him to sit next to her. Shinji twitched at this gesture. He wanted to repair what had already transpired, but wasn't sure if it would even matter.  
在经过几个痛苦的瞬间决定是否继续对话后，真嗣正要站起来，却发现明日香已经抢先一步。他不确定她是默默流泪还是已经流干了眼泪，因为她的脸是干的，正看着他。几秒钟后，明日香示意他坐在她旁边。真嗣对这个动作有些紧张。他想要修复已经发生的事情，但不确定这样做是否还有意义。

"Are you sure." Shinji asked hesitantly.  
“你确定吗？” 真嗣犹豫地问道。

Asuka nodded but it was her eyes that Shinji was watching. They showed sincerity and Shinji excepted that.  
明日香点了点头，但真嗣关注的是她的眼睛。它们流露出真诚，真嗣接受了这一点。

Sitting down silently next to Asuka he glanced at her and saw that her eyes were staring at the ground. 'Give her as much time as she needs,' Shinji told himself.  
默默地坐在明日香旁边，他瞥了她一眼，发现她的目光凝视着地面。‘给她足够的时间，’ 真嗣对自己说。

After what seemed an eternity Asuka slowly opened her mouth. "I don't know why I always put you down, I really don't. But-" She paused unsure if she should go on. It was still painful. But he shared and now it was her turn.  
仿佛过了一个世纪，明日香缓缓张开了嘴。“我不知道为什么我总是贬低你，我真的不知道。但是——”她停顿了一下，不确定是否应该继续。那仍然很痛苦。但他分享了，现在轮到她了。

"You could compare our childhoods and see similarities."  
“你可以比较我们的童年，看看相似之处。”

Shinji was startled to no end and gaped confusedly back at her. "What!"  
真嗣惊得目瞪口呆，困惑地回望着她。“什么！”

"I said that from the sound of it we both had troubling childhood!"  
"我说听起来我们俩的童年都不太愉快！"

"You don't have to yell."  
"你不用这么大声。"

"...Sorry." "...抱歉。"

"Its fine." “没事的。”

Asuka nodded and continued. "My mother like yours died early, she worked at Nerv. I remember her though, slightly. I get my hair from her. My father though...he remarried and we were happy for a while. But then...he caught my stepmother sleeping with another man, and she left him for him."  
明日香点点头，继续说道：“我母亲和你母亲一样，很早就去世了，她在 NERV 工作。我虽然对她有些模糊的记忆，但我知道我的头发是遗传自她。至于我父亲……他再婚了，我们曾一度过得很幸福。但后来……他发现继母和另一个男人有染，她就为了那个男人离开了他。”

Shinji was silent but a creese was steadily started to form on his forehead.  
真嗣沉默不语，但他的额头上逐渐皱起了一道纹。

"My father sort of lost it after that...he started drinking heavily. I'd come home some nights and he'd be completely drunk, smelling of booze. Sometimes he'd confuse me for his first wife, my mother, and attack me in a drunken rage. By then I'd starting learning stuff on my own...I think I was six or seven at the time...he rarely remembered my birthdays."  
那之后，我父亲有点崩溃了……他开始酗酒。有些晚上我回家，他会完全醉倒，满身酒气。有时他会把我错当成他的第一任妻子，也就是我的母亲，然后在酒醉中对我发狂。那时我开始自学一些东西……我想我当时六七岁……他很少记得我的生日。

Shinji's frown was now very noticeable and his knuckles were starting to turn white. He also noticed that Asuka's voice was starting to get softer and softer."  
真嗣的眉头现在非常明显，他的指节开始变白。他还注意到明日香的声音开始变得越来越轻。

She continued. "My father slept with so many different women over those three years that I can't count the times that he kept me up at night, with his fucking around." It was the first time that her voice showed a hatred that Shinji had not yet seen. It was something that he had never experienced.  
她继续说道：“那三年里，我父亲和那么多不同的女人睡过，我数不清有多少次他让我彻夜难眠，就因为他那些该死的勾当。”这是她第一次表现出真嗣未曾见过的恨意。这是他从未经历过的情感。

"Several times he'd beat me when he got home, either after a long night of drinking, or after being dumped by another woman. I called 911 several times but each time they showed up he brushed it off as a minor attitude adjustment, saying that I had just had a temper tantrum and that it was all resolved. I don't think I've had a temper tantrum since I was five years old."  
有好几次，他回家后都会打我，要么是酗酒一夜之后，要么是被另一个女人甩了之后。我多次拨打 911，但每次警察来时，他都轻描淡写地说这只是小打小闹，说我只是发了脾气，事情已经解决了。我不记得自己五岁以后还发过脾气。

"I remember I took a test...on my own, my IQ was high enough for it. I had saved up enough money to pay for it. It was to get into a college in Germany. I studied like crazy and starting to distance myself from my so called father. He realized this but ignored it, saying that I'd turn into a slut like all the other woman that he'd ever met."  
我记得我参加了一个测试……靠自己的能力，我的智商足够高。我攒够了钱来支付费用。这是为了进入德国的一所大学。我疯狂学习，开始疏远我所谓的父亲。他意识到了这一点，但置之不理，说我也会变成像他遇到过的所有女人那样的荡妇。

Shinji's face was obviously showing rage but he tried to downplay it. Asuka paused here and took a deep and Shinji saw that she hesitated.  
真嗣的脸上明显带着愤怒，但他试图掩饰。明日香在这里停顿了一下，深吸一口气，真嗣注意到她犹豫了。

"Its okay if you don't want to continue."  
"如果你不想继续也没关系。"

Asuka shook her head, "I've buried this for so long. I'm rather glad to get it off my chest."  
明日香摇了摇头，"我埋藏这件事太久了。我很高兴能把它说出来。"

"You sure?" "你确定吗？"

Asuka nodded, and continued. "I had just turned ten, and was excited to get into the college, and get away from my father. He came back one night though, heavily drunk." Asuka's voice broke here and she started to shake uncontrollably. Shinji had never been in a situation like this before and wasn't sure how he should react.  
"明日香点点头，继续说道：“那时我刚满十岁，满心期待着进入大学，逃离父亲。但有一天晚上，他醉醺醺地回来了。”明日香的声音在这里哽咽了，她开始无法控制地颤抖。真嗣从未遇到过这种情况，不确定自己该如何反应。”

"M-My father attacked me in a drunken rage...he...he mistook me for my mother. For awhile...he had stopped abusing me...because I had called the police so...much that they were suspicious. He didn't...gi..give me a chance to get to the phone." Asuka then put both hands up to her face and mumbled, "He tried...t-to...ra-rape me."  
"“我父亲在酒醉中对我发起了攻击……他……他把我错当成了我母亲。有一段时间……他停止了对我的虐待……因为我多次报警……他们开始怀疑了。他没……给我机会去打电话。”明日香随后双手捂住脸，喃喃道，“他试图……对我……施暴。””

If Shinji had been clenching something it would have shattered. Boiling hatred the likes of which he never new surfaced. His hatred of his own father couldn't even compare to what he felt like doing to this bastard.  
"如果真嗣手里握着什么东西，那一定会被他捏碎。他从未感受过如此沸腾的仇恨。他对亲生父亲的恨意与之相比简直微不足道，他此刻只想对这个混蛋施以同样的报复。”

Asuka meanwhile had her faced buried in her hands and was crying silently. She had always built up a strong front, that she was invulnerable to anything. This though was something that she had always buried deep. Nobody knew about this except for the psychiatrist that she met frequently after her father had tried to rape her. Now Shinji knew.  
与此同时，明日香将脸埋在双手中，默默地哭泣。她总是筑起一道坚强的防线，仿佛无坚不摧。然而，这是她一直深藏心底的秘密。除了她父亲试图强奸她后频繁见面的心理医生，没有人知道这件事。现在，真嗣知道了。

Shinji looked helplessly back at Asuka who was still crying silently. What should he do? Ignore what she said and act as though it was in the past and everything was okay. Maybe if he was the Shinji from several weeks ago he would have. Now was different.  
真嗣无助地回头看向仍在默默哭泣的明日香。他该怎么办？无视她的话，假装一切都已过去，一切都没事了。或许如果是几周前的他，他会这么做。但现在不同了。

Without even hesitating he leaned his arm behind Asuka's back, which was easy as she was leaning forward with her face buried in her hands. At first he thought about patting her on the back, reassuring her that everything was okay. Instead though he decided to bring her into a comforting hug. Though it appeared that he didn't have to take the initiative as Asuka leaned into it as though waiting for his touch.  
他毫不犹豫地伸出胳膊，绕到明日香的背后，这很容易，因为她正向前倾，脸埋在双手中。起初，他想过轻拍她的背，安慰她一切都会好起来。然而，他决定给她一个安慰的拥抱。虽然看起来他不必主动，因为明日香似乎一直在等待他的触碰，自然而然地靠了过来。

Soon Shinji had his hands wrapped around Asuka's middle as she cried silently into his shoulder. "Its okay," he mumbled. She seemed glad that somebody was just there for her.  
"很快，真嗣的双手环绕在明日香腰间，她默默地靠在他的肩上哭泣。“没事的，”他喃喃道。她似乎很高兴有人在她身边。”

After several odd minutes for Shinji, Asuka pulled back as though realizing what she was doing. "Sorry you had to see that."  
"对真嗣来说，这几分钟显得格外漫长，明日香突然退开，仿佛意识到自己在做什么。“抱歉让你看到这一幕。””

"Don't feel bad about it. Nobody should have to carry something like that. Makes my sufferings seem like a joke."  
“别为此感到难过。没人应该背负这样的重担。相比之下，我的痛苦简直像个笑话。”

Asuka let out a small hiccup and put a hand to her mouth as though embarrassed by showing this much emotion. "You wont tell anyone, will you."  
明日香发出一声小小的呃逆，用手捂住嘴，似乎因流露出如此多的情感而感到尴尬。“你不会告诉任何人吧，会吗？”

Shinji shook his head, "I don't even want to think about it. I'm so mad I'd kill him if I saw him right now."  
真嗣摇了摇头，“我甚至不想去想这件事。我现在气得要是见到他，真想杀了他。”

"You'd have to beat me to it."  
“你得先过我这关。”

It felt weird that they could talk about something this disturbing so calmly. But Shinji knew otherwise, he knew that Asuka was hurting.  
他们能如此平静地讨论这样令人不安的事情，感觉很奇怪。但真嗣知道实情，他知道明日香正在受伤。

"We should probably get to bed," Shinji finally said.  
“我们或许该去睡觉了，”真嗣终于说道。

Asuka nodded her consent and sat up quickly as though determined that she was first to get to her room first. Shinji however caught her wrist, worried about her.  
明日香点头同意，迅速坐起身来，仿佛决心要第一个回到自己的房间。然而，真嗣抓住了她的手腕，担心着她。

"You're okay right?" “你没事吧？”

Asuka seemed to revert back to her normal self slightly as she said to Shinji, "What, thinking that I'll need somebody to sleep next to tonight?"  
明日香似乎稍微恢复了平时的样子，对真嗣说：“怎么，以为我今晚需要人陪睡吗？”

Shinji could have laughed, glad that she seemed to be back to her usual teasing self. Playing along he said, "Only if you want me to."  
真嗣差点笑出声来，很高兴她似乎又回到了平时爱捉弄人的状态。他顺着她的话说：“只要你愿意。”

"Get real. The day I let you sleep with me is the day Third Impact is initiated."  
"别做梦了。我让你上我的床的那天，就是第三次冲击启动的日子。"

"You better hope that never happens then."  
"那你最好祈祷那一天永远不会到来。"

Asuka's face turned pink slightly as she just realized the very real possibility of that happening. Marching back to her door she slid it open and slammed it closed with her foot.  
明日香的脸微微泛红，她刚刚意识到这种可能性确实存在。她快步走回自己的门前，拉开滑门，用脚砰地一声关上。

Shinji sighed at the obvious revert to her usual self. Though he hoped that things would have improved between them. Walking back to his room he opened the door and sat down on his futon, looking up at the ceiling. If only he knew that Asuka was doing the same thing.  
真嗣对着她明显恢复常态的样子叹了口气。尽管他希望他们之间的关系会有所改善。他走回自己的房间，打开门，坐在被褥上，抬头望着天花板。如果他知道明日香也在做同样的事情就好了。

Breakfast the next morning was subdued from the moment the two entered the kitchen. Misato realized that something must have happened last night between the two, because every time they looked at each other they quickly turned away.  
第二天早上的早餐从两人进入厨房的那一刻起就显得沉闷。美里意识到昨晚他们之间一定发生了什么，因为他们每次对视后都迅速移开目光。

"Well, I'm off to work, then. See you two later."  
“那么，我去上班了。再见，你们俩。”

Asuka and Shinji didn't even say anything, or nod for that matter. Shinji didn't want to bring up last night, or rather he wouldn't if Asuka didn't want him to. He really couldn't blame her.  
明日香和真嗣连一句话都没说，甚至连点头示意都没有。真嗣不想提起昨晚的事，或者说，如果明日香不想让他提，他就不会提。他真的不能怪她。

After a few minutes of silence Shinji said, "Lets get ready for school, I'll start making lunch."  
沉默了几分钟后，真嗣说道：“我们准备上学吧，我来开始做午饭。”

Asuka nodded and slid off her chair and slowly walked to her room to take a shower and change. Shinji sighed when she was no longer in view. Really he preferred the annoying, slightly bitchy Asuka to the one that he had to walk to school with.  
明日香点点头，从椅子上滑下来，慢慢走向她的房间去洗澡和换衣服。真嗣在她看不见之后叹了口气。说实话，他更喜欢那个有点烦人、有点泼辣的明日香，而不是现在这个和他一起走到学校的她。

After making their lunches Shinji waited for a while for Asuka to come out of her room fully dressed. However when he didn't even hear the sound of the shower running he walked over to her door and said quietly, "You ready?"  
做完午餐后，真嗣等了一会儿，希望明日香能穿好衣服从房间里出来。然而，当他连淋浴的声音都没听到时，他走到她的门前，轻声问道：“准备好了吗？”

What came back was her usual tone, "Leave me alone, baka."  
回应他的是她一贯的语气，“别烦我，笨蛋。”

Shinji sighed and leaned his back against the wall opposite her door. After a moments pause he said, "If you don't want to go to school just say so."  
真嗣叹了口气，背靠在她门对面的墙上。片刻停顿后，他说道：“如果你不想去学校，直说就好。”

Shinji thought he heard an intake of breath and then the release of the breath. "Fine..."  
真嗣以为他听到了一声吸气，随后是呼气声。“好吧……”

"I'll get the work that you'll miss."  
“我会完成你错过的那些工作。”

"Whatever." “随便。”

Shinji thought about opening the door to her room but was afraid that she might throw something at him. So he grabbed his lunch off the counter, turned around and whispered a small, "See you later," before walking out the door.  
真嗣考虑过打开她房间的门，但又害怕她会朝他扔东西。于是他拿起柜台上的午餐，转过身，轻声说了句“再见”，然后走出了门。

Asuka meanwhile had her face buried in her pillow, trying to forget about her past.  
与此同时，明日香把脸埋在枕头里，试图忘记她的过去。

School seemed rougher for some reason without Asuka with him. Maybe it was the fact that half the school seemed to think that they were going out and Asuka would kill them if they said anything bad to Shinji. So Shinji was battered with questions repeatedly about where Asuka was. At one point somebody asked where his bitch was, referring to Asuka. Shinji had almost smashed the guy's head on the sink fountain, but Kensuke pulled him away before he had a chance to.  
不知为何，没有明日香在身边，学校的生活似乎更加艰难。也许是因为学校里有一半人认为他们在交往，而明日香会杀了那些对真嗣说坏话的人。因此，真嗣不断被问及明日香在哪里。有一次，有人问他的婊子在哪里，指的是明日香。真嗣差点把那家伙的头撞到水池上，但健介及时把他拉开了。

So Shinji stormed up the stairs to the top of the school were he usually went for seclusion and was very annoyed that Kensuke was following him with a rather reluctant Touji behind him.  
于是真嗣气冲冲地跑上楼梯，来到学校顶楼，那是他常去寻求独处的地方，却非常恼火看到健介跟在他后面，而圭介则有些不情愿地跟在健介后面。

"Shinji what the fuck was that all about?" Kensuke rarely swore unless something was really bothering him.  
“真嗣，那他妈的到底是怎么回事？”健介很少骂人，除非真的有什么事让他很烦心。

"Shut it Kensuke!" “闭嘴，健介！”

"Ah did you two get in a fight," smirked Touji.  
“啊，你们俩吵架了？” 东治带着一丝嘲笑问道。

Shinji rounded on him, grabbed him by the front of his shirt and yelled, "SHUT THE FUCK UP!" These bastards couldn't understand the torment that Asuka was dealing with right now.  
真嗣转身面对他，抓住他的衬衫前襟大喊：“闭嘴！”这些混蛋根本不懂明日香现在正在经历的痛苦。

Touji seemed rather startled and took a few steps backwards as soon as Shinji let go of him. Shinji was a lot stronger then he had given him credit for.  
东治显得相当惊讶，一被真嗣放开就后退了几步。真嗣比他之前认为的要强得多。

"Damn, don't have to flip out over a stupid comment," said Touji.  
"该死，没必要因为一句蠢话就发飙吧，" 东治说道。

"You have no idea what your talking about so just shut the fuck up!"  
"你根本不知道自己在说什么，所以就他妈的闭嘴吧！"

"Ah, did you get her pregnant and now you've got to man-up because of it."  
"啊，你是不是把她搞怀孕了，现在得像个男人一样承担责任了。"

Shinji probably would have cracked Touji's skull open then if Rei didn't come walking onto the scene. To any normal person who saw what was going they would have ran to the nearest teacher and got the fight broken up. Rei however gave no noticed that Shinji was just about to kill someone and said calmly, "Shinji the principal wants to see us."  
如果不是绫波零恰巧走进现场，真嗣可能当时就真的把冬二的头骨打裂了。换作任何一个普通人看到这一幕，都会立刻跑去找最近的老师来制止这场斗殴。然而，绫波却似乎没注意到真嗣差点杀了人，只是平静地说道：“真嗣，校长要见我们。”

Shinji's face relaxed slightly as he looked back at her. "Both of us?"  
真嗣回头看向她，脸上的表情稍微缓和了一些。“我们两个都要去吗？”

Rei nodded silently, turned, and walked back down the flight of stairs.  
绫波默默地点了点头，转身走下了楼梯。

Shinji waited a few seconds, still deciding whether he should smash Touji's head in. After deciding the last thing he needed right now was expulsion, he gave both of them a disgusting look, and followed Rei at a brisk pace down the stairs.  
真嗣等了几秒钟，仍在犹豫是否应该砸烂冬二的脑袋。在决定眼下最不需要的就是被开除后，他给了他们一个厌恶的眼神，然后快步跟上绫波，走下楼梯。

After a hasty discussion with the principle, in which Shinji had learned that Misato had called the school when Asuka didn't answer hers, the two learned that an angel had appeared off the coast of China and had reduced the defense there to rubble.  
在与校长匆忙讨论后，真嗣得知美里在明日香没有接电话时联系了学校，两人得知一个使徒出现在中国沿海，并将那里的防御设施化为废墟。

Now the two of them were racing along in a Nerv jeep that had picked them up moments before. Shinji was tempted to run home really quick and grab Asuka, but decide that she didn't need a life or death battle right now.  
此刻，他们正乘坐一辆 NERV 的吉普车疾驰，这辆车在片刻前接上了他们。真嗣本想迅速跑回家带上明日香，但转念一想，她现在并不需要经历一场生死之战。

The entrance to the Geofront may have been ten miles away from school but the driver made in there in seven minutes. Shinji rolled out of the car and for once wishing that Misato had been driving. Rei jumped out of the jeep quite effortlessly and started trotting slightly towards the command center.  
虽然前往地底都市的入口离学校有十英里远，但司机仅用七分钟就到达了。真嗣从车里滚了出来，这次他竟然希望是美里在开车。绫波轻松地跳下吉普车，开始小跑着向指挥中心前进。

Misato greeted them and the gave them a few minor details. The angel seemed to be able detect when a hostile enemy approached and responded directly to that attack obliterating it in an instance. China apparently had discovered a weakness in its attack pattern though. A small window of three seconds appeared during which it wasn't able to use its positron particle beam. They were supposed to be aiming for that narrow window. Unit 00 would attack the target while Unit 01 would use a positron rifle to shoot it straight through the middle where the core was expected to be. Asuka was supposed to provide back up for Rei if anything happened but things had changed and Shinji was now pulled aside as Misato asked about Asuka.  
美里迎接了他们，并提供了一些细节。天使似乎能探测到敌意接近并直接回应攻击，瞬间将其消灭。不过，中国显然发现了其攻击模式中的一个弱点。在三秒钟的短暂窗口期内，它无法使用阳电子粒子束。他们应该瞄准这个狭窄的窗口。零号机将攻击目标，而初号机则使用阳电子步枪直接射击预计的核心位置。原本应该是明日香为绫波提供支援，但情况有变，真嗣被拉到一旁，美里询问关于明日香的事情。

"How come Asuka wasn't at school?"  
“为什么明日香不在学校？”

Shinji had just changed into his plug suit and was still trying to get used to the feeling of the fabric. Without averted his eyes from Misato he said, "She said she was sick, didn't feel well."  
真嗣刚刚换上他的插入栓服，还在努力适应布料的感觉。他没有将视线从美里身上移开，说道：“她说她生病了，感觉不太好。”

Misato frowned, "But why didn't you pick her up on the way here? Rei's job becomes much for dangerous without the backup from Asuka."  
美里皱起眉头，“但你为什么不在来的路上接她呢？没有明日香的支援，丽的工作会危险得多。”

Shrugging Shinji said, "I didn't think she'd be able to concentrate properly."  
真嗣耸了耸肩说：“我觉得她可能无法集中注意力。”

Misato frowned, "While I'm glad that you're worried about her, concentration isn't affected by temporary things like that."  
美里皱了皱眉，“虽然我很高兴你担心她，但专注力不会被那种短暂的事情影响。”

"I'll keep that in mind next time."  
“下次我会记住的。”

Shinji passed Misato without another word, while Misato was slightly surprised. Did she and Shinji just have there first argument?  
真嗣没再多说一句话就从美里身边走过，美里有些惊讶。难道她和真嗣刚刚第一次吵架了？

Soon Shinji was sent up elevator number five which would take him directly to the positron rifle. The angel, dubbed Ramiel, was hovering directly above Tokyo-3 as though waiting for something.  
很快，真嗣被送上了五号电梯，这将直接带他到达阳电子步枪处。被命名为雷米尔的天使正悬浮在第三新东京市上空，仿佛在等待着什么。

Shinji quickly adjusted the positron rifle and aimed his sights down at the target. "Misato I've got the angel in my sights."  
真嗣迅速调整了阳电子步枪，将瞄准镜对准目标。“美里，我已经锁定天使了。”

Misato didn't answer him at first but instead checked a monitor on the screen. It showed that Shinji's sync rate was currently holding steady at fifty-nine.  
美里起初没有回答他，而是检查了屏幕上的一个监视器。显示真嗣的同步率目前稳定在五十九。

'Well, he's improved so I suppose that I won't reprimand him for his attitude earlier,' thought Misato.  
'嗯，他进步了不少，我想我不会因为他早先的态度而责备他了，'Misato 心想。

Turning back towards the monitor she said, "Okay Shinji. We've got one shot at this before we have to recharge the rifle, so make it count."  
她转回监控器前，说道：“好了，真嗣。我们只有一次机会，之后就得给枪充电，所以务必命中。”

Shinji nodded and disengaged the radio from Misato. He needed to focus solely on hitting his target. Almost immediately thoughts of Asuka rushed through his head as he wondered how she was cooping back home. He was quick to push these thoughts aside though as he saw Rei take action.  
真嗣点点头，断开了与 Misato 的无线电联系。他需要全神贯注地击中目标。几乎立刻，关于明日香的思绪涌入脑海，他好奇她在家里是如何应对的。但他很快把这些念头抛开，因为看到绫波采取了行动。

Unit 00 dashed down the slope at break neck speed and charged head on at the angel. Sensing danger the angel quickly sent out a particle beam at Unit 00. Twisting around, Unit 00 jumped out of the way as the mass of energy flew past it, torching the earth behind it.  
零号机以惊人的速度冲下斜坡，直面天使发起冲锋。感受到威胁的天使迅速发射出一束粒子光束。零号机一个扭身，跳跃避开，那团能量擦身而过，将后方的大地烧焦。

Shinji knew that he would have only one chance and that he would have to choose it extremely carefully. He watched as Rei dodged another mass of energy.  
真嗣明白他只有一次机会，必须极其谨慎地选择。他看着绫波再次躲过一团能量。

Unit 00 started jumping from one spot to another, trying to get the angel to shoot at it. However the angel did not sense an immediate threat and paused once more.  
零号机开始从一个地点跳到另一个地点，试图引诱天使射击。然而，天使并未察觉到即刻的威胁，又一次停顿下来。

"I'm detecting high heat sources inside of the angel commander."  
"我检测到天使指挥官内部有高温热源。"

Misato spun around and quickly looked as the angel's heat parameters were put on screen.  
美里迅速转身，目光紧随着天使的热参数被投射到屏幕上。

Misato looked at it for a moment. It seemed as though the angel was building up a large amount energy at the very bottom of its body.  
美里凝视片刻，似乎天使正在其身体底部积蓄大量能量。

"Shit!" "该死！"

Everyone looked around the control room as Misato swore. Biting her nail she glared back at the monitor and thought, 'With that much energy built up, that angel will be able to puncture a hole directly to the Geofront.'  
当美里咒骂时，控制室里的每个人都环顾四周。她咬着指甲，怒视着监视器，心想：'能量积累到这种程度，那个使徒将能够直接穿透到地底都市。'

Grabbing a nearby headset she quickly yelled into it alerting Shinji and Rei, "Rei, Shinji, back off, we've got a problem."  
她抓起旁边的耳机，迅速向真嗣和丽喊道："丽，真嗣，撤退，我们有麻烦了。"

Shinji let out a giant breath as he was just mentally preparing himself to fire. Rei and Unit 00 quickly backed away to where Shinji and Unit 01 were laying down in the grass with the positron rifle.  
真嗣深吸了一口气，正准备开火。绫波和零号机迅速后退到真嗣和初号机所在的地方，他们正躺在草地上，手持阳电子步枪。

"What's wrong Misato?" “怎么了，美里？”

"I have no idea if its a problem or not but the angel is showing strong heat signatures at the lowest point of its body. If enough energy is built up the possibility of it tearing directly through the forty-five layers of steel to the Geofront."  
“我不确定这是否是个问题，但使徒在其身体最低点显示出强烈的热信号。如果能量积累足够，它有可能直接撕裂四十五层钢板，直达地底都市。”

Everyone was silent in the command center. Shinji didn't have enough knowledge of what was inside the Geofront to understand the severity of this.  
指挥中心内一片寂静。真嗣对地下都市的了解不足，无法理解这一情况的严重性。

"I want an estimate of how long we have until enough energy is built up to pierce the layers."  
“我要一个估计，看看我们还有多少时间，直到能量积累到足以穿透地层。”

"Umm judging by the power of an individual positron wave, the computer shows that we have ten minutes to stop the discharge."  
“呃，根据单个阳电子波的威力，电脑显示我们还有十分钟来阻止放电。”

"Shinji is the positron gun still ready."  
"真嗣，阳电子炮准备好了吗？"

"Hai." "嗨。"

"Good, ten minutes is a long time. Get to it. Rei, cover him, if the angel shows any signs of attacking Shinji."  
"很好，十分钟时间很充裕。开始吧。绫波，如果使徒有攻击真嗣的迹象，掩护他。"

"Hai." "嗨。"

Misato then sank down in her chair and let out a low sigh. 'I'm gonna need a long time at the bar to clear this one up.'  
美里随后坐回椅子上，低声叹息道：'看来我得在酒吧里待上好一阵子才能理清这事儿了。'

Shinji quickly readjusted his sights on the angel again and waited patiently for an opening.  
真嗣迅速重新调整瞄准天使的视线，耐心等待着机会。

Unit 00 charged again down the hill towards the angel. This time the angel, sensing danger, split itself into an exact replica. Two blue diamonds were now floating over Tokyo-3. The replica fire off a positron beam directly at Unit 00. Rei managed to roll out of the way as the positron beam flew over her.  
零号机再次冲下山坡，向天使发起冲锋。这次，天使察觉到了危险，分裂成了一个完全相同的复制品。两个蓝色钻石现在悬浮在第三新东京市上空。复制品发射出一道正电子光束，直奔零号机。绫波设法翻滚避开，正电子光束从她上方掠过。

Kicking up dirt as she skidded across the ground, Rei spun around and barely managed to dodge another wave as it almost tore off Unit 00's left arm. Running parallel on the side of a hill Unit 00 jumped in the air and went flying towards the replica of the angel. The replica fired off a positron wave which Rei was forced to roll over to avoid.  
绫波滑行在地面上，扬起尘土，转身时险些躲过另一波攻击，差点撕裂零号机的左臂。沿着山坡侧面并行奔跑，零号机一跃而起，向天使的复制品飞去。复制品发射出一道正电子波，绫波被迫翻滚躲避。

Unit 00 suddenly did a downward dive at the angel. The replica put forth an AT-field as Unit 00 neared it. Copying its enemy, Rei put forth the most power full AT-field that she could muster and ripped a small hole open in the replica's AT-field. Quick as a flash she drew the progressive knife in the shoulder holster of her Eva and threw it straight through the opening. The progressive knife made a deep puncture directly where the positron wave was fired.  
零号机突然向使徒俯冲下去。复制体在零号机接近时展开了 AT 力场。模仿对手，绫波竭尽全力展开了她所能施展的最强 AT 力场，并在复制体的 AT 力场上撕开了一个小洞。她迅速从 Eva 肩部的枪套中抽出高频刀，径直穿过那个缺口投掷过去。高频刀深深刺入了正发射阳电子波的位置。

Suddenly the angel let out an ear splitting shriek that sounded like finger nails on a chalk bored. A white light appeared from inside the replica and soon filled the entire of Tokyo-3 in a blinding white light. Then, it started to fall apart. The white turn to black instantly and the seemed to be falling apart, piece by piece, almost as if it was a puzzle. The replica imploded on itself and showered Tokyo-3 in small droplets of black blood.  
突然，使徒发出了一声刺耳的尖叫，听起来像是用指甲刮擦黑板。一道白光从复制体内部发出，很快整个第三新东京市都被这耀眼的白光笼罩。随后，它开始崩解。白色瞬间转为黑色，仿佛一块块拼图般，一片片地崩落。复制体自我坍缩，将第三新东京市洒满了黑色的血滴。

Shinji's concentration was halted for a second as he watched this all unfold but heard Misato yelling something.  
这一切的发生让真嗣的注意力中断了一瞬，但他听到了美里在喊些什么。

"Six minutes until penetration, and what the hell happened to the angel."  
"还有六分钟就要穿透了，天使到底怎么了。"

Shinji did a double take and looked down the barrel of the positron rifle. She was right! The angel had disappeared, most likely when the replica had imploded and blinded everyone.  
真嗣定睛一看，顺着阳电子步枪的枪管望去。她说得没错！天使不见了，很可能是在复制体坍缩并让所有人失明的时候消失的。

"Kuso! Where is it!" "该死！它去哪儿了！"

Looking wildly around Shinji tried to get a fix on the angel's position.  
真嗣疯狂地环顾四周，试图确定使徒的位置。

"Large heat source directly behind Unit 01, commander," said an operative.  
“指挥官，Unit 01 正后方有大型热源，”一名操作员报告道。

Without even thinking Misato yelled, "Shinji get out of there!"  
米莎毫不犹豫地大喊：“真嗣，快离开那里！”

Shinji didn't even hesitated, and Unit 01 rolled to its left as a particle wave melted the rifle which was their only source of hope. Shinji rolled out of the way as another wave barely missed him. Kicking up off the ground he was greeted by a giant shadow that was hovering directly above him.  
真嗣毫不犹豫，初号机向左翻滚，一道粒子波瞬间融化了他们唯一的希望——那把步枪。真嗣一个翻滚躲开另一道几乎擦身而过的波束。他一脚蹬地跃起，迎面而来的是一个巨大的阴影，正悬停在他正上方。

Shinji had never really experienced true fear until now. Every other time that he had been inside an Eva he had reacted on his emotions, or let the voice fix it for him. This time though, time seemed to freeze itself as he saw the particle wave coming at him in slow motion. Moving didn't even seem to register in his mind until the last moment when it seemed pointless.  
真嗣从未真正体验过此刻的恐惧。以往每次驾驶 EVA 时，他都是凭情绪行事，或是让内心的声音替他解决。但这一次，时间仿佛凝固，他眼看着粒子波以慢动作袭来，移动的念头直到最后一刻才在脑海中闪现，似乎已毫无意义。

Rei appeared directly in front of the angel with a heat shield and blocked the full force of the attack. Deploying her AT-field to the limit she was able to defend Shinji for a certain amount of time.  
绫波丽直接出现在使徒面前，展开热盾挡下了攻击的全部威力。她将 AT 力场发挥到极限，为真嗣争取了一定的时间。

Shinji didn't even move, couldn't for some reason. This selfless act of throwing your life away in the way to protect somebody was chivalrous.  
真嗣甚至没有动弹，不知为何无法动弹。这种无私地牺牲自己生命以保护他人的行为，是骑士精神的体现。

"...Rei..." He didn't expect a response but he got one nonetheless.  
"...绫波..." 他并未期待回应，但仍然得到了回应。

"Ikari...kun." "碇...君。"

Shinji froze, it was the first time that she had said his name. Realizing where he was and how stupid he was be he stood up next to Rei and deployed his own AT-field to the limit. The combination was enough to shatter the angels own AT-field and halt its attack for a moment.  
真嗣愣住了，这是她第一次叫他的名字。意识到自己的处境以及有多愚蠢，他站到绫波身边，将自己的 AT 力场发挥到极限。两者的结合足以粉碎天使的 AT 力场，并暂时阻止了它的攻击。

Turning around the two sprinted down the bank and quickly ducked down behind some buildings. Shinji took a quick look at Unit 00's arms. If he had stopped her in time the arm might be gone. The heat shield was melted to an indistinguishable wad of mental, and the hand that held it was slightly twisted. Shinji couldn't imagine what the temperature inside the entry plug had been.  
两人转身沿着河岸疾跑，迅速躲到一些建筑物后面。真嗣快速看了一眼零号机的手臂。如果他及时阻止了她，那手臂可能已经消失了。热盾被熔成了一团难以辨认的金属块，握着它的手也有些扭曲。真嗣无法想象插入栓内的温度有多高。

"You okay, Rei?" His voice held general concern.  
“你还好吗，绫波？”他的声音中带着普遍的关切。

Silence from her entry plug for a minute in which Shinji started to get worried, then he heard a small voice.  
从她的插入栓里沉默了一分钟，这让真嗣开始感到担忧，随后他听到了一个微弱的声音。

"Yes, I am." “是的，我在。”

"Good. I'm glad." “太好了。我很高兴。”

"You're glad." It wasn't a question, it was a statement.  
"你很高兴。" 这不是一个问句，而是一个陈述。

"Course I'm glad. You're a friend, if something happens to you I'd be worried."  
"当然高兴。你是朋友，如果你出了什么事，我会担心的。"

Rei was silent for a moment and the said, "Friend?"  
丽沉默了一会儿，然后说："朋友？"

"Yeah, you an Asuka are both my friends."  
“是啊，你和明日香都是我的朋友。”

Before either of them could say a word a positron wave tore straight through the building in between them. Rei and Shinji jumped backwards as they saw the angel slowly coming nearer, a faint glow now underneath it.  
在他们能说出一个字之前，一股阳电子波直接穿透了他们之间的建筑物。真嗣和绫波跳向后方，看到天使缓缓靠近，其下方隐约发出微光。

"Damn it, only three minutes left." Shinji looked wildly around for something that might be able to help them...with out much luck. So he did the only thing that he knew that had a chance of working. Concentrating deeply he reached into the very depths of his subconscious. He felt nothing but the LCL fluid around him and inhaled deeply, taking in the smell of blood which he would likely never get used to.  
“该死，只剩三分钟了。”真嗣疯狂地四处寻找可能帮助他们的东西……但运气不佳。于是他做了唯一知道有可能奏效的事。他深吸一口气，集中精神，深入到潜意识的深处。他只感觉到周围的 LCL 液体，深吸一口气，闻到了血腥味，这味道他可能永远都无法习惯。

"Unit 01's sync rate is climbing!"  
"初号机的同步率正在上升！"

Misato stopped biting her nail and looked wildly around. "What!"  
美里停止咬指甲，慌乱地四处张望。“什么！”

"The pilot of Unit 01 is syncing perfectly with Unit 01. Sync rate climbing, sixty-one...no sixty-two...sixty-three."  
"初号机的驾驶员与机体同步率完美匹配。同步率上升，六十一……不，六十二……六十三。"

Misato watched, surprised at Shinji's sudden improvement. 'Is this what happens when he actually tries,' she wondered?  
美里惊讶地看着真嗣突然的进步。'这就是他真正努力时的样子吗？'她暗自思忖。

As Shinji opened his eyes he felt the LCL fluid change. It was comfortable now for him, as though he had always belonged there. The temperature had changed also. It was warm not, like a giant quilt that was tossed over him, and he didn't even seem to taste the blood anymore.  
当真嗣睁开眼睛时，他感觉到 LCL 液体的变化。现在对他来说很舒适，仿佛他一直属于那里。温度也变了，现在温暖如同一床巨大的被子盖在他身上，他甚至不再尝到血液的味道。

"What happened?" “发生了什么？”

"_You finally accepted the Eva and in doing so the Eva has accepted you."_  
"你终于接受了 Eva，而 Eva 也因此接受了你。"

"How come you weren't with me the entire time?"  
"为什么你不是一直陪在我身边？"

"_Sad that I wasn't giving you instruction?"_  
"因为我没有一直在指导你而感到难过吗？"

"Not really. Just that whenever I've had a problem you've taken over."  
"并不是真的。只是每次我有问题时，你总是接手处理。"

"_I wanted you to have to deal with it on your own. You did better than I expected actually."_  
"我希望你能自己解决。实际上，你做得比我想象的还要好。"

"Great, well I need help now!"  
"太好了，现在我需要帮助！"

"_You sure you want to go through with this?"_  
"你确定要这么做吗？"

"Of course, even if I end up in the infirmary again."  
"当然，即使我再次进医务室。"

"_Thats what I like to hear."_  
"我就喜欢你这种精神。"

Shinji was prepared for it this time but it still freaked him out. Nerves from the Eva snaked its way along his skin, piercing into him and connecting with his own nerves. Next he felt like a white, hot poker, pierced into the side of his temples. Droplets of blood leaked from the small holes in his skin and soon blended with the LCL fluid. Strangely the smell of the LCL fluid and his own blood seemed to relax him. Almost as if the two blending together harmonized with him.  
这次真嗣有所准备，但仍感到惊慌。Eva 的神经沿着他的皮肤蜿蜒，刺入他的体内，与他的神经相连。接着，他感觉像是被一根白热的拨火棍刺入太阳穴。血滴从皮肤上的小孔中渗出，很快与 LCL 液体混合。奇怪的是，LCL 液体的气味和他自己的血混合在一起，似乎让他放松了。仿佛这两者融合在一起，与他产生了和谐共鸣。

"_Blood pressure normal. LCL fluid density has been changed. How does it feel?"_  
“血压正常。LCL 液体密度已调整。感觉如何？”

"Right...somehow." “还行……算是吧。”

"_Good, you're getting used to it."_  
"很好，你已经习惯了。"

"I still feel disgusted by it."  
"我还是觉得恶心。"

"_You really should be used to it by now."_  
"你现在真的应该习惯了。"

"Forget it!" "算了吧！"

"..._Fine_." "……好吧。"

Unit 01 shuddered violently as it let out a violent roar, ripping apart the bracers that secured the mouth shut. Arching its back, it got down on all fours and kicked off against the ground, ripping apart the ground as it charged. Shinji felt as though had something had grabbed him behind the collar and jerked him backwards at the sudden change of movement. He wasn't even in control anymore.  
初号机剧烈颤抖着，发出一声狂暴的咆哮，撕裂了固定嘴巴的支架。它弓起背，四肢着地，猛地蹬地向前冲去，地面被撕裂开来。随着突如其来的动作变化，真嗣感觉像是有人抓住了他的后领猛地向后一拽。他甚至已经无法控制自己了。

Jumping through the air, Unit 01 raised both its fists and brought them down on the angels AT-field. Letting out an earsplitting roar it repeated bashed its fists against the AT-field.  
跃入空中，01 号机双拳高举，猛地砸向天使的 AT 力场。伴随着震耳欲聋的咆哮，它不断用拳头猛击 AT 力场。

"_Help me out here. I need you to concentrate."_  
“帮我一把，集中精神。”

"I'm trying, damn it!" “我在努力，该死！”

"_Well try harder."_ “那就再努力些。”

Shinji concentrated harder and felt the LCL fluid change drastically. The controls inside the entry plug disintegrated and changed into LCL fluid. Then Shinji felt a burning sensation start at his feat and creep up to his head. His plug suit was slowly dissolving. Soon Shinji was completely naked and floating inside the entry plug with nothing holding him except the nerves of the Eva.  
真嗣更加集中精神，感觉到 LCL 液体发生了剧烈变化。插入栓内的控制装置分解并转化为 LCL 液体。随后，真嗣感到一种灼热感从脚底开始蔓延至头部。他的驾驶服正在慢慢溶解。不久，真嗣便完全赤裸，仅靠 EVA 的神经悬浮在插入栓内。

Unable to move his body he thought in his mind.  
身体无法动弹，他在心中思索着。

'What is this?' “这是什么？”

'_True synchronization.'_ “真正的同步。”

Unit 01 then stopped attacking sporadically and jumped backwards, glaring at the angel, almost like it had a mind now. Shinji then projected his thoughts in his own mind which were received by the Eva, via the connected nerves. Unit 01 then took off again, charging at the angel. This time though, instead of attacking randomly, it smashed its fists into the AT-field of the angel. Unit 01 quickly generated its own AT-field and attempted to rip apart the angels own AT-field.  
初号机随即停止了零星的攻击，向后一跃，瞪着使徒，仿佛此刻它也有了意识。真嗣在心中投射出自己的想法，通过连接的神经被 EVA 接收。初号机再次启动，向使徒冲去。这一次，它没有盲目攻击，而是用拳头猛击使徒的 AT 力场。初号机迅速生成自己的 AT 力场，试图撕裂使徒的 AT 力场。

Digging its nails into the angels AT-field it was able to open up a small hole. Quickly thrusting its head into the hole it let out a roar that shattered the remains of the angels AT-field. Quick as a flash, Unit 01 smashed both its fists into the side of the angel. The angel seemed to crumble slightly as Unit 01 repeatedly smashed its fists directly into the side of the angel.  
它用指甲刺入天使的 AT 力场，成功撕开了一个小洞。迅速将头探入洞中，发出一声咆哮，震碎了天使剩余的 AT 力场。零一机敏如闪电，双拳猛击天使的侧面。天使似乎微微崩塌，零一不断用拳头直接击打天使的侧面。

As Unit 01 was about to smash its fists into the side of the angel again, the angel quickly shifted so that it was able to fire its positron wave. A quick red flash appeared as the angel fired. Shinji reacted quicker though. Putting all his thoughts into the Eva's AT-field he projected a cone like AT-field which deflected the attack and sent it back towards the angel. The angel was able to deflect it though by firing another positron wave, make the first veer of course. That was all Shinji needed.  
正当零一准备再次用拳头击打天使的侧面时，天使迅速移动，发射出正电子波。一道快速的红光闪现，天使开火了。但真嗣反应更快。他将所有思绪集中在 EVA 的 AT 力场上，投射出一个锥形 AT 力场，将攻击偏转并反弹回天使。天使虽然通过发射另一道正电子波改变了第一道波的轨迹，但这正是真嗣所需要的。

Reacting to the three second window, Unit 01 quickly appeared in front of the angel, grabbing both sides of it. Gripping the sides of the angel, Unit 01 dug its fingers into the angel and by projecting a large AT-field between the two hands, tour off a large chunk of the angel. Black blood poured from the open wound and several large organs, caked with a substance like bone marrow, fell to the ground.  
在三秒窗口期内，初号机迅速出现在使徒面前，双手紧抓其两侧。初号机用手指深深嵌入使徒体内，通过在双手间投射出巨大的 AT 力场，撕下了一大块使徒的肉体。黑色的血液从撕裂的伤口中涌出，几块沾满类似骨髓物质的巨大器官也随之坠地。

Unit 01 let out a ferocious roar as it thrust its head directly into the open wound. Flesh and blood poured forth as Unit 01 dug inside the body of the angel. Shinji was slightly repulsed as he could feel the slimy taste of the flesh and the iron like blood pouring through his mouth, but he had to find it.  
初号机发出一声凶猛的咆哮，将头部直接插入那敞开的伤口中。血肉横飞，初号机深入使徒体内挖掘。真嗣感到一丝恶心，他能感受到那滑腻的肉质和铁锈般的血液涌入口中，但他必须找到那个东西。

After a few seconds of digging Unit 01 paused and ripped its head out the wound of the angel. The head was dripping in blood and some was pouring from the mouth. Something was in its mouth though, a red object that looked similar to a marble. With a quick clench of the teeth the red marble shattered and fell from the Eva's teeth.  
挖掘了几秒钟后，初号机停顿了一下，猛地将头从使徒的伤口中抽出。头部滴着血，有些血从口中流出。但它的嘴里确实含着什么，一个红色的物体，看起来像颗玛瑙。随着牙齿的迅速一咬，红色玛瑙碎裂，从 EVA 的齿间掉落。

With the core of the angel removed and destroyed the angel seemed to twist and writhe. Large chunks of flesh started to fall off and sink to the ground. Shinji watched this all in slow motion from the eyes of the Eva.  
随着天使的核心被移除并摧毁，天使似乎开始扭曲和蠕动。大块的肉体开始脱落并沉向地面。真嗣通过 Eva 的眼睛，以慢动作目睹了这一切。

"Pattern blue has disappeared, the angel has been defeated."  
「蓝色模式已消失，天使已被击败。」

Misato let out a shaky laugh and sank in her chair. She didn't even want to know how much time was left. Shinji's performance was incredible though. His sync rate read at seventy-two when he had disengaged combat. Even so the way he initiated combat was both reckless, and slightly scary. He didn't seem to show any emotion.  
美里发出颤抖的笑声，瘫坐在椅子上。她甚至不想知道还剩下多少时间。尽管如此，真嗣的表现还是令人难以置信。他在脱离战斗时的同步率达到了七十二。尽管如此，他发起战斗的方式既鲁莽又略显可怕。他似乎没有表现出任何情感。

Letting out a low sigh Misato said, "Bring in Unit 00 and 01, and get the has-mat team down there to start clean up." 'And get me a cold beer while your at it,' she thought.  
美里低声叹了口气，说道：“把零号机和初号机带进来，让防化小组下去开始清理。”她心里想着：‘顺便给我拿瓶冰啤酒。’

Shinji was rather hesitant as he stood outside of Misato's apartment, and rather mad at the conversation that had followed after he returned from fighting. Misato had scolded him about his way of fighting, saying that he was way to reckless and should have waited for back up from Rei. Shinji had retorted that he had defeated the angel so why should she be angry at him. He was honestly annoyed with Misato right now, but he was more worried about Asuka. She had to assume that something had happened judging by that fact that Shinji hadn't come home from school.  
真嗣站在美里的公寓外，相当犹豫，对战斗结束后发生的那场对话感到愤怒。美里责备他的战斗方式，说他太过鲁莽，应该等丽来支援。真嗣反驳说他已经打败了使徒，为什么她还要对他生气。他现在确实对美里感到恼火，但他更担心明日香。考虑到真嗣放学后还没回家，她不得不认为发生了什么事。

He was hoping that she might have gone to bed early and opened the door slowly hoping that he wouldn't wake her if she was asleep. However, when he opened the door he heard the blaring of the T.V. and assumed that she was still up. Tiptoeing his way into the living room he saw that Asuka was sprawled on the ground, with her head resting on a pillow, and entangled in a pile of blankets. At first he thought that she was sleeping but then he noticed that she had her head propped up in her hands.  
他希望她可能已经早早上床，于是慢慢地打开门，希望如果她在睡觉的话不会吵醒她。然而，当他打开门时，他听到了电视的轰鸣声，猜想她应该还没睡。他蹑手蹑脚地走进客厅，看到明日香四肢摊开躺在地上，头枕着一个枕头，被一堆毯子缠绕着。起初他以为她在睡觉，但随后注意到她用手撑着头。

She must have heard the door open because she sat up slowly, letting the blankets slide off her body, and turned towards the hallway where Shinji was standing. Shinji tried not to stare to much but it was rather difficult. She was wearing a white, loose, tank-top, with white and blue striped underwear, and appeared to have been laying there for a while. Rubbing her eyes slowly she squinted in Shinji's general direction.  
她一定是听到了开门声，因为她慢慢地坐了起来，让毯子从身上滑落，转向信二站立的走廊。信二尽量不盯着她看，但这相当困难。她穿着一件宽松的白色背心，搭配蓝白条纹的内裤，看起来已经在那里躺了一段时间。她慢慢地揉着眼睛，眯着眼睛朝信二的大致方向看去。

"Baka Shinji?" “笨蛋信二？”

"Yeah, and could you drop the baka?"  
"是啊，你能别再叫我笨蛋了吗？"

Asuka shrugged and went back to watching television. Shinji wasn't sure if he should go straight to sleep or risk an argument with her. Deciding that they were on friendly level and that he didn't want to break it he inched his way towards his room when he heard her accusing voice.  
明日香耸了耸肩，继续看电视。真嗣不确定自己是该直接睡觉，还是冒险和她争论。考虑到他们目前关系还算友好，他不想破坏这种状态，于是小心翼翼地朝自己的房间挪去，这时他听到了她责问的声音。

"Where are you going?" "你要去哪儿？"

Shinji paused for a second and said, "To bed. I'm sorta tired."  
真嗣顿了一下，说道：“去睡觉。我有点累了。”

Stealing a quick glance at the living room he saw that Asuka still hadn't moved.  
他迅速瞥了一眼客厅，看到明日香仍然没有动。

"You can go to bed later. I want to know why you fought the angel without me."  
“你可以晚点再睡。我想知道你为什么在没有我的情况下与使徒战斗。”

Shinji flinched. Of course she would have known about the angel attack. The JSDF would have announced something completely false was happening and that everyone had to evacuate to the shelters. Asuka would of course known that it was really an angel attack.  
真嗣畏缩了一下。她当然知道使徒袭击的事。日本自卫队肯定会宣布发生了完全虚假的事件，要求所有人撤离到避难所。明日香自然知道那实际上是使徒的攻击。

"Oh...that..." “哦...那个...”

"Oh that? Is that all you can say?"  
“哦，那个？你就只能说这个吗？”

"Can't you at least be a little thankful?"  
"你就不能至少表示一点感激吗？"

"For what!" "为了什么！"

"Look, you didn't go to school so I didn't think that you'd be able fight well enough. When Misato asked me where you were I said that you were sick and not feeling well."  
"听着，你没去上学，所以我没想到你能打得那么好。当美里问我你在哪儿时，我说你生病了，感觉不舒服。"

"That doesn't affect the synchro-"  
"那不会影响同步率——"

"I know! ...I was just looking out for you is all, because of last nig-"  
"我知道！……我只是关心你，因为昨晚的事——"

Shinji caught himself in mid sentence. Certainly mention of last night would set her off.  
真嗣话说到一半突然打住。提到昨晚的事肯定会惹她生气。

Asuka was frowning at Shinji, rather curiously. Shrugging she said, "Well it was rather relaxing anyway, and I certainly deserved the day off."  
明日香正皱着眉头好奇地看着真嗣。她耸耸肩说：“反正挺放松的，我确实该休息一天。”

Standing up she walked over to Shinji and had to tilt her head slightly up towards him. She just realized that he was slightly taller than her, though they were both the same age. "Don't let it happen again though." At her words she calmly extended her index finger and flicked it against his nose, catching Shinji completely off guard.  
她站起来，走到真嗣面前，不得不稍微抬头看他。她这才意识到他比自己稍高一些，尽管他们同龄。“不过别再有下次了。”她平静地伸出食指，轻轻弹了一下他的鼻子，真嗣完全没料到这一招。

Asuka turned around, her hair brushing against Shinji's face, and crawled back into the blankets.  
明日香转过身去，头发拂过真嗣的脸颊，然后钻回了被窝里。

Shinji continued standing there as though he was frozen. He had seriously thought that she was about to kiss him.  
真嗣继续站在那里，仿佛被冻住了一般。他真的以为她要吻他了。

After several seconds in which time seemed to freeze for Shinji, Asuka turned towards Shinji and frowned. "What's wrong with you?"  
在几秒钟的时间里，时间似乎对真嗣来说凝固了，明日香转向真嗣并皱起了眉头。“你怎么了？”

Shinji seemed to come out of his stupor and nervously said, "Nothing."  
真嗣似乎从恍惚中回过神来，紧张地说：“没什么。”

"Liar, you thought I was going to kiss you."  
"骗子，你以为我要吻你。"

Shinji blushed a deep crimson and waved his hands in front of his face, "No, I don't think of you like that."  
真嗣的脸颊涨得通红，双手在脸前挥舞着，"不，我没那么想你。"

Asuka rolled her eyes and turned back towards the T.V. "Grow some balls and start thinking like that then."  
明日香翻了个白眼，转身面向电视，"长点胆子，就该那么想。"

Shinji sighed and said, "What, you want me to think like that?"  
真嗣叹了口气，说道：“什么，你想让我那样想吗？”

It was Asuka's turn to be embarrassed as she quickly turned around before Shinji could see the pink tinge that had appeared on her face.  
轮到明日香感到尴尬了，她迅速转过身去，以免真嗣看到她脸上泛起的粉红色。

"Baka, just go to sleep already."  
“笨蛋，快去睡觉吧。”

"Yeah, yeah, I'm going." “是是，我这就走。”

Asuka kept her gaze fixed on the T.V. as Shinji left the room. When she heard his door closed she let out a low sigh and rolled over onto her back. Several emotion coursed through her which she didn't recognize, and all of them had something to do with Shinji. Turning off the T.V. she sat up and ran her hands through her hair. A small smile had appeared on her face.  
碇真嗣离开房间时，明日香目光依旧紧盯着电视。听到他的房门关闭声，她轻轻叹了口气，翻身仰躺。心中涌动着她辨认不清的情感，而这些情感无一不与真嗣有关。她关掉电视，坐起身来，双手穿过发丝，嘴角浮现出一抹淡淡的微笑。

**Okay I'm posting this in a motor home as we drive through town stealing internet as we go. As you'll notice I've taken a lot of liberties with some things here and there. And sorry if there's bad grammar in this one. When I've got time I'll fix it.

### Chapter 7: Partners

**Phew...got another done. You'll noticed I changed some stuff (again). On another note I figured that I'd get something sorted out before it was brought up. I've flip flopped with the idea of adding lemon into this sometime or another. I even planned out half a chapter in my head after Asuka and Shinji having sex and the repercussions that followed. Though I decided to scrap the whole idea and leave it for later, and by later I mean the sequel to this. In this Shinji and Asuka are one year older than they were in the anime and I decided on this age largely because of the dialogue between the teenagers (You'll notice how vulgar it can get at times). So if you were hoping for lemon in this I hate to disappoint you but lemon between two fifteen year olds is a gigantic no no in my world. BTW sequel will be named Two of Us, and if you can guess were I got the name from...well then you're as much a fan of them as I am. And close curtain.  
呼...又完成了一章。你会发现我又改了一些内容（再次）。另一方面，我想在问题被提出之前先理清一些事情。我一直在犹豫是否要在某个时候在这部作品中加入柠檬（即情色内容）。我甚至在脑海中构思了半章，讲述明日香和真嗣发生关系后的后果。不过我最终决定放弃这个想法，留待以后再说，这里的“以后”指的是这部作品的续集。在这部作品中，真嗣和明日香比动画中大一岁，我选择这个年龄主要是因为青少年之间的对话（你会注意到有时会变得多么粗俗）。所以，如果你期待在这部作品中看到情色内容，我很抱歉让你失望了，但在我的世界里，两个十五岁的孩子之间的情色内容是绝对禁止的。顺便说一下，续集将命名为《我们俩》，如果你能猜到我从哪里得到这个名字的...那么你和我一样是他们的粉丝。然后，拉上帷幕。**

Gendo Ikari sat calmly at his desk. It was close to midnight and he had just finished reading the report that Ritsuko had given him about Pilot 01's latest improvement. Shinji's sudden improvement both brought his plan closer, but also brought greater dangers to his plan. If he should go out of control again, well, Instrumentality might be initiated sooner then he might like it, and while he knew he could control Shinji if he wished, he still didn't have all the pieces.  
碇源堂平静地坐在他的办公桌前。时间已近午夜，他刚刚读完赤木律子交给他的关于驾驶员 01 最新进步的报告。真嗣的突然进步不仅使他的计划更近一步，同时也给他的计划带来了更大的危险。如果他再次失控，那么，人类补完计划可能会比他希望的更早启动，尽管他知道自己如果愿意，可以控制住真嗣，但他仍然没有掌握所有关键因素。

Clasping his hands together he glanced down at the brief that Ritsuko had sent him. The woman may be completely useless in the future, but for now he would be able to control her to his designs.  
他将双手合十，瞥了一眼赤木律子发给他的简报。这个女人将来可能完全无用，但目前他还能按照自己的设计控制她。

Picking a particular paper up he glanced at the few words she had left in the margins at the end of it. 'While Shinji's sync rate has increased dramatically he seems to have grown slightly aggressor. While that may be due to his experiences inside Unit-01, I don't know. An odd thing came up during the analysis of his battle though. During the time when Unit 01 generated the AT-field that tore the angel in half a brief instance of two At-fields were noticeable between the hands. It is possible though that this was the angel's AT-field and that the computer misread it.'  
他拿起一张特定的文件，瞥了一眼她在页边留下的几句话。'虽然真嗣的同步率显著提升，但他似乎变得有些好斗。这可能是由于他在初号机内的经历所致，我不确定。但在分析他的战斗时，出现了一件奇怪的事情。在初号机生成 AT 力场将使徒撕成两半的时刻，双手间短暂出现了两个 AT 力场的迹象。虽然这可能是使徒的 AT 力场，计算机误读了它。'

Gendo let the paper fall back on his desk and rested his elbows on the edge of his desk. He had wondered whether Ritsuko would have noticed this anomaly. The kid had undoubtably grown, but still not to where he could be useful. Well, he could still wait.  
碇源堂让文件重新落回桌面，双肘撑在桌沿。他曾怀疑过赤木律子是否注意到了这个异常。那孩子无疑成长了，但仍未达到能派上用场的地步。不过，他还可以等待。

A small smile appeared on Gendo's face as he anticipated the future.  
碇源堂脸上浮现出一丝微笑，期待着未来。

When Shinji woke up the day after his fight with the angel Ramiel he thought that he was still dreaming. Never in his life would he have expected to smell food in Misato's apartment that wasn't being made by his own hands. Sitting up, he rubbed his eyes to be sure he wasn't dreaming only to realize how foolishly it was to rub your eyes if it was something you were smelling.  
当真嗣在与天使拉米尔战斗后的第二天醒来时，他以为自己还在做梦。他从未想过会在美里小姐的公寓里闻到不是自己亲手做的食物。坐起身来，他揉了揉眼睛，确认自己不是在做梦，却意识到如果闻到的是气味，揉眼睛是多么愚蠢的行为。

Standing up groggily, still half asleep, he opened the door a little and stuck his head into the doorway. He could smell something wonderful coming from the kitchen but due to the odd design of the apartment couldn't see who it was. It certainly couldn't have been Misato...the house would have burned long ago, and Asuka wouldn't be caught dead making something for herself. So who did that leave?  
他昏昏沉沉地站起来，还半睡半醒，轻轻推开门，探出头去。他闻到厨房里飘来一股美妙的味道，但由于公寓的奇特设计，他看不到是谁在做饭。当然不可能是美里……房子早就烧起来了，而明日香绝不会屈尊为自己做饭。那么，还能是谁呢？

Keeping his body pressed firmly against the wall of the hallway he slowly walked forward and into the kitchen. In his surprise he almost tripped over his own feet and fell flat on his face. It was Asuka, though she certainly didn't seem like Asuka.  
他紧紧贴着走廊的墙壁，慢慢向前走，进入了厨房。他惊讶得差点绊倒自己，脸朝下摔倒。是明日香，但她看起来一点也不像明日香。

She was facing the stove and seemed to be fretting over the dials, trying to figure out how to work them. Once or twice Shinji thought he heard her say, "How the hell does that baka use this damn thing?"  
她正对着炉子，似乎在为那些旋钮烦恼，试图弄清楚如何操作。一两次，真嗣觉得他听到她在说：“那个笨蛋到底是怎么用这该死的东西的？”

She had her hair tied back in a pony tail, something that Shinji never expected to see but had to admit it looked good. Shinji then noticed that she had found the white apron that he occasionally used when he didn't want to get his clothes dirty. Though last time he wore it he could have sworn it had a stain on it.  
她的头发扎成了马尾，这是真嗣从未预料到的，但他不得不承认这样看起来不错。真嗣随后注意到她找到了他偶尔会用的白色围裙，以免弄脏衣服。尽管上次他穿的时候，他发誓上面有个污渍。

It seemed that she had found the correct setting for the stove and Shinji then saw that she seemed to be pouring some sort of bater in a frying pan. His mind ran through a series of things that she could be cooking before it rested on pancakes. He was rather surprised that she would be making something so plain. He had made them a few times before and she had always eaten them with little or no complaints. So why should she be making them now?  
看来她已经找到了炉子的正确设置，真嗣随后看到她似乎在向煎锅里倒某种面糊。他的脑海中闪过一系列她可能正在烹饪的东西，最终停留在煎饼上。他相当惊讶她会做这么简单的东西。他之前做过几次，她总是吃得不多，几乎没有抱怨。那么她现在为什么要做呢？

Abandoning all pretenses he calmly walked the rest of the way into the kitchen and sat down at the table there. He wondered how long it would take her to realize that he was there, she seemed completely focused on the stove. After a minute of silence Shinji breached it.  
他放下所有伪装，平静地走进厨房，坐在那里的餐桌旁。他好奇她要多久才能意识到他在那里，她似乎完全专注于炉子。沉默了一分钟后，真嗣打破了沉默。

"You're certainly up early."  
“你今天起得真早。”

Asuka almost jumped three feet in the air at his comment and almost knocked the pan of the stove. Spinning around quickly she saw him sitting at the table grinning at her. Quickly hiding the brief tinge of pink that had appeared on her cheeks because of her actions she retorted, "Damn it, you almost made me spill the frying pan."  
听到他的话，明日香几乎跳了起来，差点把锅从炉子上撞下来。她迅速转身，看到他坐在桌旁，对着她咧嘴笑。她迅速掩饰住因自己动作而泛起的脸颊上的微红，反驳道：“该死，你差点让我把煎锅弄洒了。”

"You're the one that jumped."  
"是你跳下去的。"

Asuka threw a scowl at him before turning back towards the stove.  
明日香瞪了他一眼，然后转身回到炉子前。

Shinji shrugged, got up, and grabbed himself a glass of orange juice out of the fridge.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，站起身，从冰箱里给自己拿了杯橙汁。

After taking a large gulp he said in a low voice, "Any reason why you're making breakfast and not me?"  
他猛地喝了一大口，然后用低沉的声音问道：“有什么理由是你做早餐而不是我吗？”

Asuka seemed to tense up for a second but then regained her composure. "Not particularly, would you rather do it?"  
明日香似乎紧张了一瞬，但随即恢复了镇定。“没什么特别的原因，你更想做吗？”

"No, I just don't see what the point of making two breakfasts is."  
“不，我只是不明白做两份早餐的意义何在。”

Asuka looked over at her shoulder and glared at him. _"Two breakfasts?"_  
明日香回头瞪了他一眼。“两份早餐？”

"Well, yeah. Its not like your making it for both of us."  
“嗯，是啊。又不是你来做给我们俩吃。”

Without turning around Asuka said, "Fine! You won't get any then."  
明日香没有转身，说道：“好吧！那你一份也别想得到。”

It took Shinji several seconds to realize what she ment by this statement. "Wait, what? You mean you had planned on making enough for both of us."  
真嗣花了好几秒才明白她这句话的意思。“等等，什么？你是说你本来就打算做够我们两个人吃的？”

"That was my intention when I woke up this morning but if you don't want to taste my cooking go right ahead and just eat cereal."  
“我今早起床时的确是这么打算的，但如果你不想尝尝我的厨艺，尽管去吃麦片好了。”

An awkward silence was met by this during which Shinji rebuked his hasty words. After a few minutes of silence he said, "Sorry what I said, just didn't expect you to be thinking of me."  
这段话之后是一阵尴尬的沉默，真嗣在心里责备自己说话太急。沉默了几分钟后，他说：“抱歉，我刚才的话，只是没想到你会考虑到我。”

Asuka response was to hit him on the back of the head with a serving spoon. "Ass!"  
明日香回应的方式是用一把勺子敲打他的后脑勺。“笨蛋！”

Shinji rubbed the spot on his head, slightly confused. Was Third Impact close?  
真嗣揉了揉头上的部位，略感困惑。第三次冲击要来了吗？

Letting out a low sigh he rested his head on the table and mumbled. "To tell you the truth I didn't even know you could cook."  
他低声叹了口气，将头靠在桌上喃喃自语。“说实话，我甚至不知道你会做饭。”

"Just because I don't, doesn't mean I can't," she snapped back at him.  
"只是因为我现在不做，不代表我不会做，"她厉声回敬他。

"Sorry I didn't mean-" "对不起，我不是故意的——"

"Just shut it and eat," Asuka said as she dropped a plate with two pancakes on it in front of Shinji.  
"闭嘴吃你的吧，"明日香说着，将一盘装有两块煎饼的盘子放在真嗣面前。

Shinji frowned at the plate and then looked up at Asuka who had her arms crossed and was trying not to look in his direction.  
真嗣对着盘子皱了皱眉，然后抬头看向明日香，她双臂交叉，尽量不朝他的方向看。

"Err, you sure you don't want to eat first."  
“呃，你确定不想先吃吗？”

Asuka raised an eyebrow at him and replied cooly, "Its fine."  
明日香对他挑了挑眉，冷冷地回答：“没事。”

Shrugging Shinji picked up a fork and knife and dug into the first one. It was good, way better than his and he could understand why she had wanted to make it. It was fluffy, but not to the point of it getting to soggy when syrup was applied. It didn't even really need syrup.  
耸了耸肩，真嗣拿起叉子和刀开始吃第一个。味道很好，比他自己做的要好得多，他明白为什么她想做这个了。松软适度，即使加上糖浆也不会变得过于松软。甚至不太需要糖浆。

"This is good, far better that how I make it actually."  
“这个很好吃，比我做的要好多了。”

Asuka tried not to look to pleased with herself.  
明日香尽量不让自己显得太得意。

"Where did you learn to cook like this anyway?"  
"你到底是在哪儿学会做这么好吃的菜的？"

Shrugging Asuka said, "At college. I didn't eat out much. Pancakes is what I usually ate each morning. I sorta made my own recipe."  
明日香耸了耸肩说："在大学里。我不怎么在外面吃。早餐通常都是吃煎饼，我有点自己琢磨出来的食谱。"

"Its good." "真不错。"

"Glad you liked it." "很高兴你喜欢。"

"What about you? Aren't you going to get a plate?"  
"那你呢？不打算拿一盘吗？"

Asuka's face seemed to shift as her features reacted wildly to his question. "Err, no. I already ate."  
明日香的脸色似乎变了变，她的表情对他的问题反应激烈。“呃，不了。我已经吃过了。”

Shinji hesitated for a fraction of a second and that was all Asuka needed to make an excuse. "Don't get any ideas! I didn't make it for you, I just hadn't made it in a while and felt like it was good practice."  
真嗣犹豫了片刻，而这正是明日香所需要的借口。“别多想！我不是为你做的，只是很久没做了，觉得这是个不错的练习机会。”

"U-huh." “嗯-嗯。”

Asuka's face turned slightly pink as she turned around, "Baka!"  
明日香转过身去，脸上微微泛红，“笨蛋！”

Shinji just laughed and dug into another piece. He found it funny that she didn't want to admit that she had made it specifically for him. Though whether she was proving that hers tasted better or just felt like giving him the day off he wasn't sure. Though he seemed to lean a little to the latter.  
真嗣只是笑了笑，又挖了一块吃。他觉得她不愿承认这是专门为他做的挺有趣。虽然她是在证明自己的味道更好，还是只是想让他休息一天，他不太确定。不过他似乎更倾向于后者。

"And hurry it up will you, we're gonna be late for school."  
“快点儿，我们要迟到了。”

"Hai, hai." “嗨，嗨。”

Asuka then busied herself with cleaning up the mess that she had left...which was quite a lot.  
随后，明日香忙于清理她留下的烂摊子……那可真不少。

After devouring four pancakes Shinji called himself satisfied and quickly entered his room and started to dress. After pulling on his shirt and fastening the buttons he thought he heard the phone ringing and Asuka's annoyed voice answering it. Grabbing some socks off his floor he hopped out on one foot, putting them on as he went.  
吃完四块煎饼后，真嗣自认为心满意足，迅速回到房间开始更衣。穿上衬衫并扣好扣子后，他似乎听到电话铃声和明日香不耐烦的应答声。他从地上抓起几双袜子，单脚跳着，边走边穿。

His first guess that something was wrong when he saw Asuka frowning slightly as she talked into the receiver of the phone. After a hasty hang up Asuka turned to him and said, "Misato wants us to come to Nerv right now."  
当他看到明日香微微皱眉对着电话听筒说话时，他首先猜测出了问题。匆匆挂断电话后，明日香转向他，说道：“美里让我们现在就去 NERV。”

Still hopping on one foot Shinji replied, "Angel attack?"  
仍然单脚跳着的真嗣回答道：“使徒来袭？”

Asuka nodded silently and for once Shinji wished that he was going to school.  
明日香默默地点了点头，这一次，真嗣真希望自己能去上学。

Sighing he said, "Best get moving then."  
他叹了口气说：“那最好赶紧动身。”

Asuka nodded and followed him out the door.  
明日香点点头，跟着他走出门外。

---

As soon as Asuka and Shinji entered Nerv headquarters they were directed to the command center. Misato then filled them in on an angel that they had detected of the coast of Tokyo-3. Not much was known about this angel and they were supposed to be extremely cautious. Rei would not be taking part in the operation though owing to the fact that Unit-00 was still damaged from the last battle. Asuka was therefore determined to show Shinji that she was the better of the three children. Before they were sent up to the surface though Misato gave them some advice.  
明日香和真嗣一进入 NERV 总部，就被引导到指挥中心。美里随后向他们通报了在东京-3 海岸附近探测到的一个使徒。关于这个使徒的信息并不多，他们被告知要极其谨慎。由于零号机在上次战斗中受损，绫波不会参与此次行动。因此，明日香决心向真嗣展示她在这三个孩子中是最优秀的。在他们被派往地表之前，美里给了他们一些建议。

"Now this is technically your first time teaming up together so I want you two to get along, and by this I mean not arguing and working together.  
“现在这实际上是你们第一次合作，所以我希望你们俩能和睦相处，我的意思是不要争吵，要协同工作。”

"It'll be fine as long as Shinji just listens to me. I am the better pilot after all," said Asuka while shrugging. Misato hadn't told her about his performance in the last battle, or the fact that he had almost beaten her best sync rate.  
"只要真嗣听我的，一切都会顺利的。毕竟我才是更优秀的驾驶员。" 明日香耸耸肩说道。美里并没有告诉她真嗣在上一场战斗中的表现，以及他几乎打破了她最佳同步率的事实。

Turning around, Asuka smiled at Shinji and said, "Got that baka."  
转过身，明日香对真嗣微笑着说："明白了吗，笨蛋。"

Shinji sighed and replied, "Yeah."  
真嗣叹了口气，回答道："嗯。"

Misato was nervous for the results of this battle.  
美里对这场战斗的结果感到紧张。

After the two entered their respected Eva's Misato's voice came over the intercom. "Asuka enter elevator number three, Shinji number two. Rifles will be awaiting you at the surface."  
两人进入各自的 Eva 后，美里的声音通过对讲机传来。“明日香进入三号电梯，真嗣进二号。地面上有步枪等着你们。”

Shinji sighed and felt a familiar sense of being shot through a cannon as he rocketed to the surface.  
真嗣叹了口气，感觉自己像被大炮轰出去一样，飞速冲向地面。

As the gate for the elevator opened Unit 01 quickly grabbed a rifle and ducked down behind a building. Shinji saw that Asuka had done similar and was several blocks to the left of his position.  
电梯门一开，初号机迅速抓起一支步枪，躲到一栋建筑后面。真嗣看到明日香也采取了类似行动，位于他左侧几个街区之外。

"Pattern blue detected entering Tokyo-3 defense zone," came a voice over the intercom. "Retracting Tokyo-3 now."  
“蓝色模式检测到进入东京-3 防御区域，”对讲机里传来一个声音，“现在开始撤回东京-3。”

It still amazed Shinji every time he saw it. The buildings, almost retreating into the safety of the Geofront. He suddenly wondered what it would look like if the sun was setting as it happened. Shaking his head quickly he emptied his thoughts and looked to his left to see Unit 02 crouching, waiting for the go ahead.  
每次看到这一幕，真嗣仍然感到惊叹。那些建筑，几乎退回到地表之下的安全地带。他突然好奇，如果此时夕阳西下，这一幕会是什么样子。他迅速摇了摇头，清空思绪，向左看去，只见零号机蹲伏着，等待指令。

After several tense minutes Shinji felt the silence of everyone around him and heard Misato over the intercom. "Lockdown of Tokyo-3 confirmed, proceed with the operation."  
经过几分钟的紧张气氛，真嗣感觉到周围的寂静，并听到美里通过对讲机传来指令：“第三新东京市的封锁已确认，继续执行任务。”

Almost as soon as Misato cut the radio Shinji saw a screen open on the monitor to his left and frowned when he saw Asuka smirking at him.  
美里刚切断通讯，真嗣几乎立刻看到左侧监视器上打开了一个屏幕，当他看到明日香对他得意地笑时，不禁皱起了眉头。

"Just stay back and let me handle this. I'll show you why I'm the best pilot here."  
“你就待在后面，让我来处理。我会让你明白为什么我是这里最棒的驾驶员。”

"Wait, don't you think its better if we both attack it."  
"等等，你不觉得我们俩一起攻击会更好吗？"

His words were apparently ignored as Asuka dove out from behind her hiding spot and rushed towards the waterfront.  
显然，他的话被忽视了，因为明日香从她的藏身之处冲了出来，直奔水边。

Shinji but his lip and swore, "Damn it, can't she ever listen to anything I say."  
真嗣咬了咬嘴唇，发誓道：“该死，她怎么从来不听我说的话。”

Taking off after her he thought anyway, 'Whether she wants help or not I'm giving it to her.'  
他追上去时心想，'不管她是否需要帮助，我都要给她。'

Shinji was quick to catch up with Asuka and she was visibly surprised by it. Smiling slightly she thought, 'Oh? Seems that he's improved a little bit.'  
真嗣很快追上了明日香，她明显感到惊讶。她微微一笑，心想，'哦？看来他进步了一点。'

Soon both of them could see the angel walking slowly out of the water and onto the beach.  
很快，两人都能看到使徒缓缓从水中走出，踏上沙滩。

"Shinji watch this, I'm going to kill it in one shot."  
"真嗣，看好了，我一枪就能解决它。"

"Asuka wait! We shouldn't charge in without knowing what its powers are!"  
"明日香，等等！我们不应该在不了解它的能力的情况下贸然进攻！"

Unit 02 dashed towards he angel, creating a deep groove in the sand. Though the angel seemed to be slow, with its bulky arms and legs it swung quickly as Unit 02 got into range. Asuka rolled around the angel quite easily as she dodged its arms.  
2 号机朝着天使疾驰而去，在沙地上划出一道深痕。尽管天使看似动作迟缓，笨重的四肢却在 2 号机进入攻击范围时迅速挥动。明日香轻松地绕着天使翻滚，躲避着它的手臂。

Now behind her target she quickly pulled out her progressive knife and stabbed it straight in the back. A small fountain of black blood erupted out of it and with a quick slash downwards Asuka managed to split it in two.  
现在她已经绕到了目标身后，迅速拔出她的渐进式刀，直刺入背部。一股黑色的血液喷涌而出，阿斯卡迅速向下划去，成功将其一分为二。

Black blood spilled forth as it fell in two separate heaps, landing with a thud on the sand. Soon the sand had turned black from the blood and parts of Unit 02 were coated in the blood. Shinji had to turn away as he saw several large organs fall out of the angel and writhe around on the sand before falling silent. He was inadvertently remembering his past battle and the taste of the flesh that had gone through his mouth.  
黑色的血液四溅，它分成两堆倒下，重重地落在沙地上。很快，沙地被血液染黑，二号机的部分也被血液覆盖。真嗣不得不转过头去，因为他看到几个巨大的器官从使徒体内掉出，在沙地上扭动，最后静止不动。他无意中回忆起自己过去的战斗和那穿过嘴里的肉的味道。

"See, one shot was all it took. I am the best though so its not to be unexpected."  
“看，一击就够了。我是最棒的，所以这并不意外。”

Shinji couldn't help but smile, he was fairly impressed. Relaxing slightly he felt a slight tingle on the back of his neck and felt a familiar voice whisper, "Its _not over yet_."  
真嗣忍不住笑了，他相当佩服。稍微放松了一些，他感到后颈一阵轻微的刺痛，一个熟悉的声音低语道：“还没结束呢。”

Next second Shinji heard an ear splitting racket over the intercom from Misato.  
下一秒，真嗣从通讯器里听到了美里震耳欲聋的喊声。

"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOUR DOING. DESTROY THE DAMN CORE BEFORE IT REGENERATES!"  
“你到底在搞什么鬼！在它再生之前毁掉那个该死的核心！”

Shinji looked wildly back at the angel and saw something truly horrifying. The angel was slowly starting to rebuild itself. Pieces of flesh started to mold together and reform on the sand. Organs exploded and reformed into two different organs, leaving many different colored liquids in the sand. Shinji thought what he recognized as the stomach deflate and then tear itself into. Stomach acid was formed in the walls of the stomach and slowly started to fill back up. Shinji had a strong urge to bring his breakfast back up but held it. The large and small intestines split themselves apart and then reformed again. It was like high speed cell regeneration.  
真嗣狂乱地回头看向使徒，目睹了一幕真正骇人的景象。使徒正缓慢地自我修复。肉块开始在沙地上融合重组，器官爆炸后又重新形成两个不同的器官，留下各种颜色的液体在沙地上。真嗣认出那像是胃的器官先是萎缩，然后撕裂开来。胃酸在胃壁中形成，并慢慢重新充满。真嗣强烈地想要把早餐吐出来，但还是忍住了。大肠和小肠自行分裂，然后再次重组。这就像是高速的细胞再生。

Soon the two different flesh piles fixated itself onto each of the different halves of the angel. Not even a scar could be visible as the angel, now two separate halves, picked itself off the ground.  
很快，两堆不同的肉块各自固定在使徒的两个半边上。使徒现在分成两半，从地上站起，连一道疤痕都看不见。

Asuka seemed to not have noticed as she had her back to the angel now and was just wondering why Misato seemed so worried when she felt something hit her Eva in the back. She was sent flying forward and collided directly into Unit 01.  
明日香似乎没有注意到，她背对着使徒，只是好奇为什么美里看起来如此担忧，这时她感觉到有什么东西击中了她的 EVA 背部。她被猛地向前抛出，直接撞上了 01 号机。

"Damn it Asuka, get off me."  
"该死的明日香，从我身上下来。"

"Its your fault for standing there."  
"谁让你站在那儿的。"

"Its your fault for attacking so recklessly."  
"谁让你攻击得这么鲁莽。"

Asuka bit her lip and ignored his comment. How the hell was she supposed to know that this was going to happen.  
明日香咬了咬嘴唇，对他的话置之不理。她怎么可能预料到会发生这种事。

"Anyway, just pick one and attack it."  
“总之，随便选一个攻击就行了。”

Shinji was about to agree with her when he heard Misato's angry voice come on the intercom again.  
真嗣正要同意她的意见，却听到美里愤怒的声音再次通过对讲机传来。

"Forget it. I'm disengaging this operation."  
"算了吧。我退出这次行动。"

"HUH," cried a shocked Asuka.  
"什么！" 明日香震惊地喊道。

"If you guys can't work together then you won't be able to beat this angel."  
"如果你们不能合作，就无法打败这个使徒。"

"Watch me!" Yelled Asuka.  
"看我的！" 明日香大喊道。

Asuka charged forward again, about to attack the one closest to her when she felt something akin to whiplash. Shinji had just barely managed to grab her Eva around the waist and pull her backwards. She had been so focused on attacking the one in front of her that she had completely ignored the other one which had been close to taking off Unit 02's right arm.  
明日香再次冲锋，正要攻击离她最近的那一个时，她感到一阵类似鞭打的冲击。真嗣刚刚勉强抓住了她的 Eva 腰部，将她向后拉。她太专注于攻击前面的那个，以至于完全忽略了另一个，后者差点就卸掉了 02 号的右臂。

"What the hell are you doing ass hole!"  
"你他妈的在搞什么鬼，混蛋！"

"Saving you damn it. You completely ignored the other one!"  
"救你个鬼啊。你完全忽略了另一个！"

"I expected you to cover me baka."  
"我以为你会掩护我的，笨蛋。"

"ENOUGH!" Yelled Misato. "Return now! Both of you."  
"够了！" 美里喊道。"现在就回来！你们两个。"

Asuka grimaced, "Damn it..."  
明日香皱了皱眉，"该死..."

Shinji wasn't to pleased either but was eyeing the angel. Oddly enough it didn't seem like it was interested in them, in fact the two separate halves reformed and went back in the ocean. Shinji dropped his guard then, and still realized that he had a hand on Asuka's Eva's shoulder.  
真嗣也不太高兴，但他正盯着那只使徒。奇怪的是，它似乎对他们并不感兴趣，实际上，那两个分离的部分重新组合，回到了海中。真嗣放下了戒备，这才意识到自己的手还搭在明日香的 EVA 肩上。

"Come on...lets head back, Asuka."  
“走吧...我们回去吧，明日香。”

"Fucking..." Letting out a sigh she said, "Fine."  
"该死的..." 她叹了口气，说道，"好吧。"

---

What followed after was, in Misato's words, "A debriefing," though Shinji thought it was more like a berating. He didn't know how many times she had called it an operational failure. What was possibly worse was the shouting match that happened between himself and Asuka. No matter what Shinji had actually done, Asuka found someway to blame the entire thing on himself. After a hasty lunch, which consisted of nothing more than T.V. dinners, Asuka and Shinji had confined themselves in there separate places. Asuka in front of the T.V. and Shinji in his room.  
接下来发生的事情，用美里的话来说，是"一次汇报"，但在真嗣看来，更像是一场责骂。他不知道她已经多少次称之为操作失误了。更糟糕的是，他和明日香之间爆发的争吵。无论真嗣实际上做了什么，明日香总能找到某种方式把整件事归咎于他。匆匆吃完一顿仅由电视快餐组成的午餐后，明日香和真嗣各自躲到了不同的地方。明日香坐在电视机前，而真嗣则回到了自己的房间。

After close to an hour of just laying there and listening to his SDAT, Shinji thought he heard the opening and slamming of the front door. Knowing that Misato would likely chew him out sooner or later he decided to get it over with sooner.  
躺了近一个小时，听着他的 SDAT，真嗣觉得自己听到了前门打开又猛然关上的声音。知道美里迟早会训斥他，他决定早点面对。

Opening his door quietly he poked his head out to see Misato's retreating back heading towards the kitchen. Misato must have heard him though because she paused for a second and said, "Shinji, I need to talk to you and Asuka."  
轻轻地打开门，他探出头去，看到美里正朝厨房走去的背影。美里似乎听到了动静，因为她停顿了一下，说道：“真嗣，我需要和你还有明日香谈谈。”

Knowing that her name would be brought up eventually, Shinji caught a brief glimpse of Asuka's face as she plodded out of the living room, being sure to give him a grimace.  
知道她的名字迟早会被提及，真嗣瞥见了明日香从客厅拖着脚步走出来的脸，她肯定给了他一个苦笑。

Sighing heavily, Shinji followed her at a distance and was unsurprised to see Misato sitting at the table with a beer already in her hand.  
重重地叹了口气，真嗣保持距离地跟在她后面，看到美里已经坐在桌前手里拿着一罐啤酒，他并不感到意外。

"Sit," she gestured to the two.  
“坐下，”她示意两人。

As soon as they had sat, Misato popped the top off the can and drank a heavy gulp. Shinji was a bit disgusted at her actions, it was only noon for Christ's sake.  
他们刚一坐下，美里就打开罐子猛灌一口。真嗣对她这行为有点反感，毕竟这才中午呢。

After taking another large gulp Misato slammed the can down on the table, folder her arms on the table, and frowned at the two. "That was some of the worst team work I've ever seen."  
又猛喝一大口后，美里将罐子重重地放在桌上，双臂交叉在桌上，皱着眉头看向两人。“那是我见过的最糟糕的团队合作。”

"Well, sorry if somebody wasn't able to keep up with me-"  
"好吧，如果有人跟不上我，我道歉——"

Shinji threw a glare in Asuka's direction and another shouting match would have followed if Misato hadn't held out her hand to shut them up.  
真嗣朝明日香的方向瞪了一眼，如果不是美里伸出一只手让他们闭嘴，一场争吵又要爆发了。

"I don't care who slowed who down. If you two won't work together you won't be able to defeat this angel." Pausing for a moment Misato continued. "This angel is able to split itself in two, though they are still part of the same angel. Because of this, they are perfectly synchronized with each other, meaning that they are able to read each other thought patterns."  
"我不在乎是谁拖了谁的后腿。如果你们两个不能合作，就无法打败这个使徒。" 美里停顿了一下继续说道。"这个使徒能够分裂成两个，尽管它们仍然是同一个使徒的一部分。正因为如此，它们之间完全同步，意味着它们能够读取对方的思维模式。"

Shinji frowned, "Humans can't read others thoughts."  
真嗣皱了皱眉，"人类无法读取他人的思想。"

Misato nodded, "While true, humans are able to sync with each other in other ways. One such form is dance and music."  
美里点头道，"虽然如此，人类还是能通过其他方式与彼此同步。比如舞蹈和音乐就是其中一种形式。"

It took Shinji slightly longer than Asuka to figure out what she ment.  
真嗣比明日香稍慢一些才领会到她的意思。

"THE FUCK IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?"  
"这他妈是什么意思？"

Shinji turned to see a bright angry Asuka glaring dumbfounded back at Misato.  
真嗣转头看到一个愤怒而困惑的明日香，正茫然地瞪着美里。

Sighing, Misato replied, "Its exactly I ment it to sound like. In order to beat this angel you two need to work together. The only way to do that in a short amount of time is to be able to fluently synchronization each others bodies to the motions of the other.  
"美里叹了口气，回答道：“我就是那个意思。为了打败这个使徒，你们俩需要合作。短时间内做到这一点的唯一方法就是能够流畅地同步彼此的身体动作。”

"Wh-What do you mean by synchronization of each other bodies."  
"同-同步彼此的身体是什么意思？"

Taking another large gulp of beer from the can, Misato slammed it back down and with a slight grin on her face shouted, "DANCE!"  
米莎又猛灌了一大口啤酒，然后将罐子重重地放回桌上，脸上带着一丝笑意大喊道：“跳舞吧！”

Shinji almost fell out of his chair...while Asuka did fall out of hers.  
真嗣差点从椅子上摔下来...而明日香则真的摔了下去。

"DANCE WITH THIS IDIOT, YOU MUST BE FUCKING CRAZY!"  
"和这个白痴跳舞，你一定是疯了！"

"Whether this seems crazy or not doesn't matter. It should theoretically work-"  
"这看起来是否疯狂并不重要。理论上它应该能行——"

"AND IF IT DOESN'T?" "如果不行呢？"

Shrugging Misato said, "We'll think of something else. But for now, this is the best we've got."  
耸了耸肩，美里说：“我们会想别的办法。但眼下，这是我们最好的选择了。”

"Damn it, why can't you just get the first to do this? I'd rather let her degraded herself instead of me."  
“该死，为什么你不能让初号机来做这个？我宁愿让她自降身份，也不想自己来。”

With her mouth half way up to the can Misato replied, "I would have used her instead but Unit 00 won't be fully repaired for another two days and we don't have that time." Slamming the can down on the table she said, "You two will from now on do everything together. You will dance together, eat together, sleep in the same room together, you will practically take a shower together."  
美里一边把嘴凑近罐子一边回答：“我本想用她，但零号机还要两天才能完全修好，我们没那个时间。”她猛地把罐子摔在桌上，说：“你们俩从现在开始要一起做所有事。一起跳舞，一起吃饭，一起睡在同一个房间，几乎要一起洗澡。”

"THE FUC-"

"Calm down Asuka, its just a figure of speech," said Shinji.  
"冷静点，Asuka，这只是个比喻，" 真嗣说道。

"You'd like that pervert."  
"你倒是挺喜欢那个变态的。"

Shinji was about to open his mouth when Misato cut in like a knife.  
真嗣正要开口，美里却像刀子一样插了进来。

"Enough! And while this is going on I don't want you two arguing with each other. That will completely undermine this project.  
“够了！而且在这期间我不希望你们两个互相争吵。那会彻底破坏这个项目的。”

"When exactly are we supposed to start?"  
“我们到底什么时候开始？”

"Now. Later I'll have you move your futons into the living room but for now I want you to go to school, even though it is late in the day."  
"现在。晚些时候我会让你把被褥搬到客厅，但现在我要求你去上学，尽管时间已经不早了。"

"Fine!" Asuka stood to get up but Misato spoke up quickly. "I've got something that I want you two to wear to school."  
"好吧！" 明日香站起来准备离开，但美里迅速开口。"我有些东西想让你们俩穿去学校。"

Holding up an oddly wrapped package Shinji was able to see some of what was inside and felt his stomach drop.  
举着一个包装奇特的包裹，真嗣瞥见了里面的部分内容，感到胃里一阵翻腾。

"NO WAY IN HELL AM I WEARING THAT," roared Asuka.  
“打死我也不穿那个！”明日香咆哮道。

"You will, because its also important to feel what the other feels, not just physically but emotionally as well, and I think you'll get plenty of emotion out of wearing those to school."  
“你会穿的，因为感受他人的感受不仅在身体上，情感上同样重要，而我认为穿上那些去学校会让你收获满满的情感体验。”

Shinji tried not to imagine them walking into class in the middle of the day, it looked painful. Kensuke and Touji would give him hell.  
真嗣尽量不去想象他们中午走进教室的情景，那看起来很痛苦。剑介和东治肯定会把他骂个狗血淋头。

---

Shinji's predication wasn't even close to the truth. Everyone's reaction were way worse then he had expected. When they had both walked in with the tight, black leather, dancing pants, and matching tank-tops the class was silent for an eternity. Then when they finally started laughing it sounded like a tornado. Kensuke started clicking his camera like mad and Touji fell out of his chair and started banging his fist on the floor. Hikari, a girl that Shinji hardly talked to but had seen talking to Asuka before, blushed an embarrassing deep red and tried to act like she had never seen Asuka before. Even the teacher gave up his feeble attempts to control to class and started snickering wildly and the two. Shinji thought that he even saw Rei crack a brief smile, though brief.
真嗣的预测与事实相去甚远。大家的反应比他预想的要糟糕得多。当他们俩穿着紧身黑色皮裤和配套的背心走进教室时，整个班级陷入了永恒的沉默。随后，当他们终于开始大笑时，那声音如同龙卷风一般。剑介疯狂地按着相机快门，而斗志则从椅子上摔了下来，开始用拳头猛敲地板。与真嗣几乎没说过话但见过与明日香交谈的女生光，脸红得令人尴尬，试图装作从未见过明日香。甚至连老师也放弃了控制班级的无力尝试，开始狂笑不止，看着两人。真嗣甚至觉得他瞥见了丽露出了短暂的微笑，尽管很短暂。

Without looking at each other Shinji and Asuka walked wordlessly to their seats while ignoring the cat-calls and jeering from there fellow students. When Shinji finally sat down he got a brief glimpse of Asuka's face as she sat down. She looked like an over ripe strawberry.  
真嗣和明日香没有互相对视，默默地走向自己的座位，无视了同学们的口哨声和嘲笑。当真嗣终于坐下时，他瞥见了明日香坐下时的脸。她看起来像一颗熟透的草莓。

Though they had arrived at school, lunch was just a few minutes away and Asuka and Shinji had no desire to socialize with other people. Shinji rarely did in the first place, but Asuka didn't feel like it either, so she joined him on the roof of the school for the first time in a while.  
尽管已经到了学校，午餐时间也不过几分钟之后，但明日香和真嗣都不想与其他人社交。真嗣本来就很少这么做，而明日香今天也没这个心情，于是她久违地和他一起去了学校的天台。

"Damn it Misato, I'm gonna give her hell tonight," said an irksome Asuka. Shinji had learned not to bother her when she was like this but didn't care that much today.  
“该死的美里，今晚我要让她好看，”明日香烦躁地说道。真嗣已经学会在她这种状态时不去打扰她，但今天他并不太在意。

"I suppose we can understand what she ment by sharing each others emotions. I don't think I've ever been more embarrassed in my life."  
“我想我们能理解她所说的共享彼此情感的意思了。我觉得我这辈子都没这么尴尬过。”

Asuka then vented some anger off by pretending that half her bento was Misato's face, though she quickly stopped when she realized how hungry she was. Honestly she hadn't eaten earlier, she had just lied to Shinji so he wouldn't feel bad.  
明日香随后通过假装便当的一半是美里脸的方式发泄了一些怒气，但很快她就因为意识到自己有多饿而停止了。老实说，她之前并没有吃东西，只是对真嗣撒了谎，以免他感到难过。

"How the hell is this supposed to help us beat that damn angel."  
“这他妈的怎么帮我们打败那个该死的天使？”

"Beats me." “我也不知道。”

"If it wasn't for you we wouldn't even be in this situation."  
"如果不是因为你，我们根本不会陷入这种境地。"

Shinji had learned long ago that it was pointless trying to convince her otherwise so he just ignored it. Though there peace was short lived as the door to the stairway came banging open.  
真嗣早就明白试图说服她是没有意义的，所以他只是置之不理。然而，他们的平静并未持续多久，楼梯间的门就被猛地撞开了。

"See told you they'd be here," said a laughing Touji as he walked through the door.  
"看吧，我就说他们在这儿，" 笑着走进门的冬二说道。"

"I suppose it seems logical since this is where Shinji spends his lunch, and I'm not surprised to see Asuka here either," said Kensuke.  
"“我想这很合理，毕竟这里是真嗣吃午饭的地方，看到明日香在这里我也不意外，”健介说道。”

Asuka stood up then and twitched slightly. Shinji could feel the anger that was coursing off of her and knew she'd like nothing better than to unleash her frustration on them. Standing up quickly before she decided to kill them, he put a hand out in front of her and said, "Best not to."  
"明日香随即站起身，微微抽搐了一下。真嗣能感受到她身上散发出的怒气，知道她恨不得将满腔的愤怒发泄在他们身上。他迅速站起来，抢在她决定动手之前挡在她面前，伸出手说：“最好别这样。””

Asuka turned her head towards him and glared at him before sitting down, "Whatever."  
"明日香转头瞪了他一眼，然后坐下，“随你便。””

Touji and Kensuke were obviously prepared to run but calmed down when Asuka sat back down. Kensuke slowly started walking over to Shinji then but still keeping an eye on Asuka, though she seemed to be preoccupied.  
冬二和剑介显然准备逃跑，但当明日香重新坐下后，他们也平静了下来。剑介慢慢地走向真嗣，但仍不时瞥向明日香，尽管她似乎心不在焉。

"So Shinji...are you gonna tell us why you two look like that?"  
“那么，真嗣……你打算告诉我们为什么你们俩看起来那样吗？”

Shinji had expected more ridicule instead of questioning. Glancing over at Asuka, the two came into eye contact and Asuka shrugged as if saying, "I couldn't give a flying fuck."  
真嗣本以为会遭到更多嘲讽，而不是询问。他瞥了一眼明日香，两人目光相接，明日香耸了耸肩，仿佛在说：“我他妈才不在乎。”

Shinji sighed then, deciding that he didn't care remotely either and delved into the long winded story of the Eva's and the battles with the angels.  
真嗣叹了口气，决定自己也不在乎这些细节，于是深入讲述起了 EVA 和与使徒战斗的长篇故事。

After a severely cut down version of events Shinji came to the part with the last battle and surprisingly Asuka picked up the story telling them how degrading it was to have to learn how to dance with Shinji. Touji then decided to make a remark which almost ended up with him knocked out with a pool of blood around him. Though Shinji had intervened at the last moment.  
在事件被大幅简化后，真嗣讲到了最后一场战斗，出乎意料的是，明日香接过了故事，告诉他们学习与真嗣共舞是多么丢脸的事。这时，冬二决定插句话，结果差点被揍得满地找牙，幸好真嗣在最后一刻阻止了他。

"Wow, so thats why you left school suddenly sometimes?"  
“哇，所以这就是你有时突然离开学校的原因吗？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"But wait Shinji how long have you been doing this."  
"但是等等，真嗣，你做这个多久了？"

"You remember when we were searching for a shelter together that time."  
"你还记得那次我们一起寻找避难所的时候吗？"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"After that time is when I decided that I'd pilot Eva."  
"那次之后，我就决定要驾驶 EVA 了。"

"Wow." "哇。"

"I don't see why your so impressed. I hate being inside of those things."  
"我不明白你为什么这么印象深刻。我讨厌待在那些东西里面。"

"So wait what were you telling me about the entry plu-"  
"等等，你刚才跟我说的是关于入口的什么来着-"

Kensuke was cut off from his rant then as the bell rang.  
随着铃声响起，健介的抱怨被打断了。

"Ah and I still had lots more questions."  
“啊，我还有很多问题没问完呢。”

"I'll you them later." “我晚点再告诉你。”

"Okay see you in class."  
"好的，课上见。"

"Yeah cya." "嗯，再见。"

Shinji and Asuka were then left alone briefly. Shinji rested his back against the chain fence before standing up. Turning towards Asuka who was still sitting he held out a hand to help her up. Asuka blinked at his gesture and seemed to look around as though expecting a crowd of people watching them. Accepting his gesture she rested her hand in his and he gently pulled her to her feet.  
随后，真嗣和明日香短暂地独处了。真嗣背靠铁丝网休息了一会儿，然后站起身来。他转向仍然坐着的明日香，伸出手帮助她起身。明日香对他的举动眨了眨眼，似乎在环顾四周，好像期待有一群人在围观他们。她接受了他的好意，将手放在他的手上，他轻轻地将她拉了起来。

Motioning towards the door Shinji said, "Come on, lets head back to class."  
示意门口，真嗣说道，“来吧，我们回教室去。”

Shinji took about half a step forward, expecting Asuka's hand to slide out of his, though it didn't. In fact she seemed to hold on tighter. Turning towards her he asked, "Asuka wha-"  
真嗣向前迈了大约半步，以为明日香的手会从他的手中滑出，但并没有。实际上，她似乎握得更紧了。他转向她问道，“明日香，怎-”

"I don't want to go back..."  
“我不想回去……”

"What?" "什么？"

"I said I don't want to go back to class. Lets...lets just go home."  
"我说了我不想回教室。我们...我们直接回家吧。"

Shinji paused for a second and thought about several things. Was she really that embarrassed about what she was wearing? It wasn't that bad once you got over the initial shock.  
真嗣停顿了一下，思考了几件事。她真的对她的穿着感到那么尴尬吗？一旦你克服了最初的震惊，其实也没那么糟糕。

Scratching his head he said, "I guess there's really no reason in staying here anymore. I think we got the emotional part down. We certainly were laughed at enough."  
他挠了挠头说：“我想我们真的没有理由再待在这里了。我觉得我们已经充分表达了情感。我们确实被嘲笑得够多了。”

"Yeah, no kidding," mumbled Asuka.  
“是啊，还用你说，”明日香咕哝道。

Asuka then let go of his hand quickly after he had agreed on heading home and walked next to him as they left the roof.  
在碇真嗣同意回家后，明日香迅速松开了他的手，与他并肩离开了屋顶。

---

Misato was unsurprisingly not back from work; still probably cleaning up the aftermath of their last battle, Shinji reminded himself.  
美里果然还没下班；真嗣提醒自己，她可能还在清理他们上次战斗的残局。

Predictably Asuka flopped down on the couch and flipped on the T.V. as soon as they got home. Shinji meanwhile entered the kitchen and was about to get a glass of water when he noticed something on the kitchen table. It was a note from Misato.  
不出所料，他们一回到家，明日香就扑通一声倒在沙发上，打开了电视。与此同时，真嗣走进厨房，正准备倒杯水时，注意到餐桌上有张纸条。那是美里留下的。

Hesitantly picking it up he had a sudden mental imagine of it starting to yell at him. Shrugging it off he walked over to the living room and had to clear his throat loudly since Asuka had raised the volume on the T.V. to maximum  
他犹豫地拿起纸条，脑海中突然浮现出它开始对他大吼的画面。他耸耸肩，走到客厅，不得不大声清了清喉咙，因为明日香已经把电视音量调到了最大。

"What baka?" Asuka asked when she muted the T.V. and turned to face Shinji.  
“什么笨蛋？”明日香关掉电视，转过身来面对真嗣，问道。

"Misato left us something."  
"美里留下了些东西。"

Asuka's eyebrows twitch angrily. She had almost torn off her dance pants and tank-top half way to Misato's apartment and it was only from Shinji convincing her otherwise that she didn't. So anything about Misato was sure to piss her off.  
明日香的眉毛愤怒地抽动了一下。她几乎在前往美里公寓的路上就撕掉了自己的舞蹈裤和背心，要不是真嗣劝阻，她早就这么做了。所以任何关于美里的事情都肯定会惹她生气。

"Whatever read it." "不管是什么，读出来吧。"

"Err okay..." “呃，好吧...”

"_Asuka, Shinji, sorry about earlier. I was a little stressed out from the battle. Anyway I left something on the counter for you two. Its the music that goes along with the dance that you'll be memorizing for the battle. The dance simulation wont be here till tomorrow though so I want you to spend a few hours just listening to the music. Most likely I wont return home tonight so Shinji don't worry about cooking extra. Can't wait to hear how school went."_  
“明日香，真嗣，抱歉刚才的事。战斗让我有点紧张。对了，我在柜台上给你们留了点东西。是你们将要记住的战斗舞蹈的配乐。不过舞蹈模拟器要到明天才能到，所以我想让你们先花几个小时听音乐。今晚我大概不会回家了，所以真嗣不用担心多做饭。等不及听你们讲学校的事了。”

_-Misato -美里_

Shinji stared at the note for a few minutes and then folded it up and put it in his pocket.  
真嗣盯着那张纸条看了几分钟，然后把它折起来放进了口袋。

"So what is it that she left us?" Asked Asuka.  
“她给我们留了什么？”明日香问道。

Shrugging Shinji walked back over to the kitchen counter while Asuka stuck her head into the hallway and watched him. What he had missed on the counter was a white envelope that seemed to barely be holding in its contents. Sliding his finger along the seem the turned it upside down and out fell an old cassette player with ear buds. A note was attached to the cassette player.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，走回厨房的柜台旁，而明日香则探头望向走廊，注视着他。他之前没注意到的是，柜台上有一个白色的信封，似乎勉强包裹着里面的东西。他用手指沿着封口划开，将信封倒置，一个旧的随身听连同耳机掉了出来。随身听上还附着一张纸条。

"_This cassette only has one song on it so just repeat it over and over. Also I know that you have your own ear buds Shinji but I want you to use these. And don't even try changing the length of it."_  
"这盒磁带只有一首歌，所以就一遍遍重复播放。还有，我知道你有自己的耳机，真嗣，但我要你用这些。别想着调整它们的长度。"

Shinji wondered what she ment by the length of the ear buds but was interrupted by someone hovering over his shoulder.  
真嗣疑惑她说的耳机长度是什么意思，但被一个俯身在他肩上的人打断了。

"That thing looks ancient."  
"那东西看起来很古老。"

Shinji turned towards Asuka and rather wished he hadn't as their noses almost touched. Passing it off he said, "Yeah, its a lot older than the one I have."  
真嗣转向明日香，几乎要后悔这个动作了，因为他们的鼻子差点碰上。他若无其事地说：“嗯，它比我手上的那个要古老得多。”

"What? You think its her father's or something."  
“什么？你觉得这是她父亲的或者什么的。”

"Maybe...should we try it?"  
“也许……我们要不要试试？”

Asuka let out a heavy sigh and smacked herself lightly on the forehead. "Might as well get this damn thing over with."  
明日香重重地叹了口气，轻轻拍了拍自己的额头。“干脆把这该死的东西解决掉算了。”

Shinji nodded and unrolled the ear buds and passed the cassette player to Asuka. Together, the two of them walked back to the living room and sat down on the couch. After turning off the T.V. the two frowned at the cassette player now resting between them.  
真嗣点点头，展开了耳机，将随身听递给明日香。两人一起走回客厅，坐在沙发上。关掉电视后，他们皱着眉头看着现在放在他们之间的随身听。

"Well, get it on with it," said Asuka with a grimace.  
“好吧，开始吧，”明日香皱着眉头说。

Shinji nodded and grabbed his ear bud piece and stuck it in his left ear while Asuka had hers in her right ear. Shinji then realized why Misato had told them not to try to resize the ear buds. The length between the two was so minuscule that their heads were banging into each other.  
真嗣点点头，拿起他的耳塞放入左耳，而明日香则将她的放入右耳。随后，真嗣明白了美里为什么告诉他们不要试图调整耳塞的大小。两人之间的距离如此之小，以至于他们的头不停地撞在一起。

"Move over damn it!" “滚开，该死的！”

"Thats not gonna work. The ear buds are what's causing this."  
“那样没用。是耳塞的问题。”

"Then making them longer."  
"然后让它们更长一些。"

Shinji pulled his out of his ear and frowned down at it. It was already at its longest.  
真嗣从耳朵里取出耳机，皱着眉头看着它。它已经是最长的状态了。

"This is as long as it gets."  
"这已经是最长的了。"

Asuka let out a shrill yell and a large quantity of German profanities, largely directed at Misato.  
明日香发出一声尖锐的叫喊，伴随着大量德语脏话，主要针对美里。

"Damn it!" "该死！"

"Not like we can do anything about it."  
"我们对此也无能为力。"

"Whatever! Just start the damn thing."  
“随便了！快点开始吧。”

Shinji nodded and finally pressed play on the player. He wasn't sure what kind of music he had expected but didn't think he'd be listening to the classics. It really wasn't much different that what he had had on his SDAT and he suddenly felt like asking Misato if he could keep the tape when they were done with it. Turning towards Asuka he was surprised that her face seemed to be fairly passive. Asuka seemed to notice and turned slightly towards him, brushing some of her hair against his forehead. "What?"  
真嗣点点头，终于按下了播放键。他不确定自己期待听到什么样的音乐，但没想到会是古典乐。这与他 SDAT 里的音乐其实没太大差别，他突然有种冲动，想问问美里结束后能否留下这盘磁带。转向明日香，他惊讶地发现她的表情相当平静。明日香似乎注意到了，微微转向他，几缕发丝拂过他的额头。“怎么了？”

"Sorry, I'm just surprised that you're not complaining about the music."  
“抱歉，我只是有点惊讶你居然没抱怨这音乐。”

"Hmph, It could have been a lot worse."  
"哼，本来可能会更糟的。"

"I suppose...but I didn't know that you liked classical music."  
"我想也是……但我没想到你喜欢古典音乐。"

Shrugging Asuka said, "Some of the greatest classical composers are from Germany. When this stuff is blaring out of every cafe on the street corners you grow to enjoy it."  
明日香耸耸肩说：“一些最伟大的古典作曲家来自德国。当这些音乐从每个街角的咖啡馆里传出时，你会逐渐喜欢上它的。”

Shinji hummed his consent.  
真嗣哼了一声表示同意。

Oddly enough they stopped squirming and flinching every time the other would accidently bump into the other. Though there had been a close call when Shinji had accidently brushed Asuka's right breast with his elbow and had almost ushered in the apocalypse. Other than that minor set back they seemed to be getting used to the physical contact.  
奇怪的是，他们不再每次不小心碰到对方时都扭动和退缩。虽然有一次真嗣不小心用肘部擦过明日香的右胸，差点引发了世界末日。除此之外，他们似乎已经习惯了身体接触。

After roughly an hour and a half of sitting their Shinji felt Asuka's stomach next to him let out a loud grumble. Doing his best to not look at her face he failed miserably and noticed that she seemed to be sitting extremely rigid with a slight blush across her face.  
大约坐了一个半小时后，真嗣感觉到明日香肚子旁边传来一声响亮的咕噜声。他尽力不去看她的脸，但失败得很惨，注意到她似乎坐得非常僵硬，脸上泛着淡淡的红晕。

Acting as though he hadn't noticed anything he pulled the bud out of his ear, stretched and said, "I'm gonna start making dinner."  
他装作什么都没注意到，从耳朵里取出那朵花蕾，伸了个懒腰说道：“我要开始做晚饭了。”

"...Fine." "……好吧。"

Dinner was quick and brief with almost no conversation, though for once Asuka offered to clean up instead of Shinji. Gratefully excepting her help, Shinji decided to clear a large enough space in the living room since the two were supposed to sleep in the same room together. Shinji had a sudden mental image of him and Asuka sleeping in a king size bed together, except that it stretched the length of five football fields and they were each on opposite ends. Honestly even in his mind it was an impossible happenstance.  
晚餐迅速而简短，几乎没有交谈，但这次是绫波主动提出帮忙收拾，而不是真嗣。真嗣感激地接受了她的帮助，决定在客厅腾出足够大的空间，因为两人应该睡在同一个房间里。真嗣突然在脑海中浮现出他和绫波睡在一张超大号床上的画面，只是这张床延伸了五个足球场的长度，而他们各自在两端。老实说，即使在他的想象中，这也是不可能发生的。

After rearranging the furniture and T.V. being sure that latter was within viewing distance of wherever Asuka was going to sleep, Shinji grabbed his futon in his room and dragged it into the living room. Asuka did likewise soon after while bringing a few other things with her.  
重新摆放了家具和电视，确保后者在绫波睡觉的地方也能看到，真嗣抓起自己的被褥，拖到客厅。绫波随后也做了同样的事情，并带了一些其他东西。

"I want to make something perfectly clear before we go to sleep."  
"在我们睡觉之前，我想把一件事说清楚。"

Shinji could guess what it was but he asked anyway. "What?"  
真嗣能猜到是什么事，但他还是问了。“什么？”

"First, if I catch you anywhere near myself while I sleep...I Will Kill You."  
"首先，如果我睡觉时发现你在我附近……我会杀了你。"

Shinji took this one to heart.  
真嗣对此深以为然。

"Second," pulling out a piece of scotch tape she stuck a piece of tape in between hers and Shinji's futon. Shinji noticed that she had a substantial amount more room on her side then he did.  
“第二条，”她拿出一片透明胶带，在她的被褥和真嗣的之间贴上了一块胶带。真嗣注意到她的那一边比他的宽敞得多。

"You are not under any circumstances allowed to cross this line. If you do than I will revert to the first one and kill you."  
“无论如何都不许越过这条线。如果你越界了，我就会回到第一条，杀了你。”

It was amazing how calmly she could say these things. Sighing Shinji said, "Do you honestly expect me to do such things?" Her glare was all he needed to shut up.  
她能如此平静地说出这些话，真是令人惊叹。叹了口气，真嗣问道：“你真的指望我去做这些事吗？”她的瞪视足以让他闭嘴。

"This is effective immediately!"  
“这立即生效！”

"Hai, Hai." Without anymore further conversation Shinji got on his futon, rolled onto his side that wasn't face her, and turned on his SDAT. If he had been facing Asuka he might have seen the annoyance that had passed over her face before she stood up. Without caring whether he could hear her or not she said that she was going to take a bath. He long since stopped caring what she did in the bathroom.  
“嗨，嗨。”没有再多说什么，真嗣躺到自己的被褥上，转向没有面对她的那一侧，打开了 SDAT。如果他当时面对着明日香，或许会看到她脸上闪过的恼怒，然后她站起身来。她不在乎他是否能听见，说她要去洗澡。他早已不再关心她在浴室里做什么。

---

Sleep came and went that night. It wasn't so much that they were sharing a room together. Just that both of them were fully aware that the other was awake but wasn't sure if they wanted to talk. So much had happened since they had met.  
那一夜，睡眠时来时去。并非因为他们同处一室，而是两人都清楚对方醒着，却又不确定是否该开口交谈。自相遇以来，发生了太多事。

After many hours had gone by it was fully dark out and Shinji could hear the light breathing of Asuka, somewhere to his right. Rolling over onto his back he caught her in his peripheral vision, it seemed that she really was asleep. Shinji couldn't quite tell but it looked like from the outline of her body that she had fallen asleep while turned towards him. Though she could have tossed and turned several times to get into that position.  
数小时过去，夜色已深，真嗣能听到右边阿斯卡轻柔的呼吸声。他翻身仰躺，用眼角余光瞥见她，似乎真的睡着了。真嗣不太确定，但从她身体的轮廓来看，她似乎是面向他入睡的。尽管她可能在睡梦中翻来覆去多次才变成这个姿势。

Shinji couldn't help but smile slightly. She was on the side furthest from the window and so some of the moonlight was able to seep through the curtain and bathe part of her face in the light. It was times like this that Shinji was glad that he knew her. Almost as though replying to his thoughts Asuka stirred. Shinji immediately switched position and turned the other way, hoping that she hadn't woken up only to find him looking at her.  
真嗣不禁微微一笑。她睡在离窗户最远的一侧，因此些许月光透过窗帘，洒在她脸上。正是这样的时刻，真嗣庆幸自己认识她。仿佛回应他的思绪，阿斯卡动了动。真嗣立刻转身背对她，希望她没有醒来，只是发现他在看她。

She seemed not to have noticed though as he heard her covers shifting slightly as she got up. Shinji tried to keep as still as possible and developed a light breathing so as to fake sleep. After several seconds he heard water coming from the kitchen and assumed that she had just grabbed a glass of water.  
她似乎并未察觉，因为他听到她的被子微微挪动的声音，她起身了。真嗣尽量保持不动，轻缓地呼吸，假装还在熟睡。几秒钟后，他听到厨房传来水声，猜测她可能只是去倒了一杯水。

Sighing in a relieving sort of way he heard the water turn of and her steady footsteps as she walked back to the living room.  
他如释重负地叹了口气，听到水声停止，以及她稳稳走回客厅的脚步声。

'I should really try to get some sleep I suppose. Tomorrow is going to be hectic,' thought Shinji.  
'我真该试着睡一会儿了。明天肯定会很忙，'真嗣心想。

Deciding that the other side was more comfortable he turned on his side, the one facing Asuka and was just prepared to drop of to sleep when he heard something surprising.  
觉得另一侧更舒服，他翻身面向明日香，正准备入睡时，却听到了令人惊讶的声音。

"Baka Shinji, you awake?"  
“笨蛋真嗣，你醒着吗？”

Shinji lay there for a long time without answering. Should he, or should he not reply? Guessing that she knew that he was awake anyway he open his eyes to find her sitting up in her futon with her eyes watching him. It certainly didn't help that the moonlight completely illuminated her now.  
真嗣躺在那里许久没有回答。他该不该回应呢？猜想她已经知道他醒着了，他睁开眼睛，发现她坐在自己的被褥上，眼睛正盯着他。月光此刻完全照亮了她，这无疑增加了他的困扰。

"Yeah...somewhat," mumbled Shinji.  
"嗯...有点吧," 真嗣咕哝道。

"Sorry if you were about to fall asleep."  
"如果你正要睡着了，抱歉。"

"Its okay," said Shinji, shaking off the drowsiness.  
"没关系," 真嗣说着，甩掉了睡意。

"I'm having trouble sleeping..."  
"我最近睡不好..."

"You're not the only one."  
"不止你一个人。"

Asuka turned her head slightly to see Shinji resting on his side watching her.  
明日香微微转头，看到真嗣侧躺着，正注视着她。

"I feel so stupid bothering you with something so trivial as this."  
"我觉得自己好傻，居然为这么点小事打扰你。"

"What is it?" "什么事？"

"...Bad dream." "...噩梦。"

Had it been any other time Shinji probably would have broken several ribs from laughing. For some reason though he could understand where she was coming from. He had certainly had his share of them in the past few weeks.  
如果不是在其他时候，真嗣可能会笑到肋骨断裂。但不知为何，他能够理解她的立场。过去几周里，他确实经历了许多。

"Anything you want to talk about?"  
“有什么想聊的吗？”

"No...its nothing...sorry to bother you."  
“不……没什么……抱歉打扰你了。”

Asuka then rolled back onto her side and faced the wall. Shinji watched her for a few seconds before rolling onto this back and looking up at the ceiling.  
明日香随后翻身侧躺，面向墙壁。真嗣注视了她几秒钟，然后也翻过身来，仰望着天花板。

"I want you to know I'm here...incase you need to talk..."  
“我想让你知道我在这里……如果你需要聊聊的话……”

Shinji then turned his head slightly and thought he caught a slight moving of her head to indicate she understood.  
真嗣微微转过头，感觉自己似乎捕捉到了她轻微的点头，表示她明白了。

"Thanks...Baka." "谢谢...笨蛋。"

Shinji almost scoffed. Even when she was showing vulnerability she never forgot to throw an insult in his direction. Well, if it made her more secure, he supposed it was all right.  
真嗣差点嗤之以鼻。即使在她表现出脆弱的时候，她也从未忘记朝他扔一句侮辱。好吧，如果这能让她更有安全感，他想这也没什么。

"Night, Asuka." "晚安，明日香。"

After a very long pause during which Shinji was close to drifting off he thought her heard, "Night, Shinji."  
在一段漫长的停顿后，真嗣几乎要睡着时，他以为自己听到了，“晚安，真嗣。”

### Chapter 8: Pain

"Damn it baka! What the hell do you think you're doing."  
"该死的笨蛋！你到底在搞什么鬼。"

"You're moving way to fast! How the hell do you expect me to keep up."  
"你动作太快了！我怎么可能跟得上。"

Misato shrugged as once again they traded verbal abuse. She was too use to it by now and popped the top off another beer.  
美里耸了耸肩，他们再次互相言语攻击。她现在已经习惯了，随手打开另一罐啤酒。

It was only the second day since they had started using the dance simulation and so far Misato thought that Nerv was wasting millions on this project. Well, it was her decision in the first place, so if anyone was screwed, it was her.  
这只是他们开始使用舞蹈模拟的第二天，到目前为止，美里认为 NERV 在这个项目上浪费了数百万。好吧，这本来就是她的决定，所以如果有人搞砸了，那就是她。

Asuka and Shinji hadn't shown a shred of improvement, Misato actually thought they had gotten worse since they started. From what she could tell it was simply a bad paring. Asuka usually kept the pace faster then Shinji could keep up and once or twice Misato had to tell Asuka to slow down so to let Shinji keep up. Asuka replied that he was just a bad dancer to which Shinji replied Asuka was just more flexible. After that Shinji had almost been castrated...by Asuka's foot. Misato wasn't even sure how many beers she had drunken over the past few days, but it wasn't enough if she was still remembering this stuff.  
明日香和真嗣没有表现出丝毫的进步，美里甚至觉得他们自从开始练习后变得更糟了。据她观察，这只是个糟糕的组合。明日香通常保持比真嗣能跟上的更快的节奏，有一两次美里不得不告诉明日香放慢速度，以便真嗣能跟上。明日香回答说他只是个糟糕的舞者，而真嗣则回应说明日香只是更灵活。之后，真嗣差点被明日香的脚踢中要害。美里不确定过去几天她喝了多少啤酒，但如果她还在记着这些事，那肯定是不够的。

After roughly two hours of non-stop practice Misato called a halt finally. Getting off the couch she said, "Thats enough for now I suppose. Anymore and you'll just end up killing each other."  
大约两个小时的连续练习后，美里终于叫停了。她从沙发上站起来说：“我想现在够了。再练下去，你们只会互相伤害。”

"God damn it, finally," said Asuka tearing off the headphones that had been resting on her head. Falling flat on the floor she rested there for a few minutes, letting the beads of sweating drip off her forehead. Shinji had done likewise, though far enough away so she wouldn't have a reason to pick a fight.  
“该死的，终于结束了，”明日香说着，摘下了戴在头上的耳机。她直接瘫倒在地板上，休息了几分钟，让汗水从额头上滴落。真嗣也做了同样的事，只是离得足够远，以免她找到挑衅的理由。

"Well, that was a little better than today's earlier attempt," said Misato.  
“嗯，这比今天早些时候的尝试要好一些，”美里说。

Asuka and Shinji both started slightly, they were remembering the performance from earlier. Somehow Shinji had managed to trip over his own feet and gone cascading into Asuka's chest, knocking them both over. Shinji still winced slightly as he remembered the pain she had inflicted on him after that.  
明日香和真嗣都微微一惊，他们想起了早先的那一幕。不知怎么的，真嗣竟然绊倒了自己的脚，一头栽进了明日香的怀里，两人一起摔倒在地。真嗣至今还记得她那之后给他的疼痛，不禁微微皱眉。

"Tch, pervert," mumbled Asuka.  
“嘁，变态，”明日香低声咕哝道。

Shinji glared in her direction and received one in return. How many times did he have to tell her that it was an accident?  
真嗣朝她的方向瞪了一眼，她也回瞪过来。他得告诉她多少次那只是个意外？

"Well, no matter," said Misato vaporizing the hostile environment. "At least you've improved a little so I suppose its a start."  
"嗯，没关系，" 美里消散了敌对的环境，"至少你有所进步，我想这是个开始。"

"I could do this so much quicker if it was just myself," replied Asuka.  
"如果只是我自己，我能更快完成，" 明日香回答道。"

Misato didn't even bother listening to her. She had to tell her almost every hour that it was impossible without Shinji.  
美里甚至懒得听她说话。她几乎每小时都要告诉明日香，没有真嗣是不可能的。

"Okay an hour for lunch, then back to work."  
"好吧，午餐一小时，然后继续工作。"

"Thats it?" "就这样？"

"You should be glad that its not less."  
"你应该庆幸不是更短。"

Asuka threw Misato a scowl and tromped her way into the kitchen. She still hadn't gotten over the embarrassment that she had suffered at school. Though on the plus they hadn't gone back since that day.  
明日香向美里投去一个白眼，然后大步走进厨房。她仍然没有从在学校遭受的尴尬中恢复过来。不过好在那之后他们就没再回去过。

After a long pause during which Shinji contemplated getting up he heard an angry snarl from the kitchen.  
在一段长时间的停顿中，真嗣考虑着是否要站起来，这时他听到厨房传来一声愤怒的咆哮。

"Shinji, food. Now!" “真嗣，吃的。现在！”

Shinji had half a mind to tell her to fix herself something but knew he'd regret it later. Ignoring a funny look that Misato was giving him he slowly sat up, wiping some sweat off his forehead and walked into the kitchen to prepare lunch.  
真嗣本想告诉她自己弄点吃的，但又知道事后会后悔。无视美里投来的奇怪眼神，他缓缓坐起身，擦去额头上的汗水，走进厨房准备午餐。

---

"Why the hell are we doing this?"  
“我们到底为什么要做这个？”

"Because the teacher asked us to."  
“因为老师要求我们这么做。”

"So, he could have gotten somebody else to do it."  
"所以，他本可以找别人来做这件事的。"

"Be we do know Shinji the best."  
"但我们最了解真嗣。"

"Yeah but why did she have to come with us," said Touji jerking a finger behind him at Hikari who was following himself and Kensuke at a distance.  
"是啊，但她为什么非得跟我们一起，" 说着，冬二用手指了指身后，光子正远远地跟在他和健介后面。"

Puffing up her cheeks in an irritated way, Hikari replied, "Because the teacher asked me to give Asuka her homework."  
光子鼓起脸颊，气呼呼地回答：“因为老师让我把明日香的作业交给她。”

"So! Those two live together so it would have been a hell of a lot easier just to send one person."  
“所以！她们俩住在一起，直接派一个人去不就省事多了。”

This was apparently news to Hikari as she stammered wildly while indecent thoughts raced through her head.  
这对光子来说显然是个新消息，她结结巴巴，脑海中闪过各种不雅的念头。

"Wh-Wh-WHAT? THEY LIVE TOGETHER?"  
"什-什-什么？他们同居了？"

"Course," replied Kensuke. "I thought that everybody in the school knew that by now. They always come to class at the same time, and their bentos are the exact same."  
"当然，"" 健介回答道。""我以为现在学校里每个人都知道了。他们总是同时来上课，而且他们的便当也一模一样。"

"I-I just thought that they lived really close to each other."  
"我-我只是以为他们住得非常近而已。"

"Naw. They've been living together for a while now."  
"不，他们已经同居一段时间了。"

"Bu-By themselves." "但-但是，他们自己住。"

"No, they got some guardian that looks after them I think."  
"不，我想他们有个监护人照顾他们。"

"By the way Kensuke, where does this Misato live anyway?"  
"话说，真希，这个美里到底住在哪里啊？"

"I'm not really sure," said Kensuke looking down at the poorly drawn map. "The directions that the teacher gave me weren't exactly well explained."  
"我也不太确定，" 真希低头看着那张画得不太好的地图说道。"老师给我的指示解释得不是很清楚。"

"Probably didn't even care if they got their homework or not."  
"可能根本不在乎他们交不交作业吧。"

"Oh, move over already!" Yelled Hikari while swiping the map out of Kensuke's hands.  
"哦，快挪开！" 光一边喊着，一边从健介手里抢过地图。

After several minutes of analyzing the teachers poor handwriting Hikari settled on a location.  
经过几分钟仔细辨认老师糟糕的字迹后，光确定了一个地点。

"Follow me you stooges." "跟我来，你们这群傻瓜。"

Kensuke let out a sigh while Touji whispered something to him. "I see why she and Asuka get along so well."  
健介叹了口气，而冬二在他耳边低语。“我明白为什么她和明日香相处得那么好了。”

After another fifteen minutes the three found themselves standing outside an apartment door. According to Hikari this was where Misato Katsuragi lived, and apparently two others.  
又过了十五分钟，三人站在了一扇公寓门前。据光说，这是葛城美里住的地方，而且显然还有另外两个人。

"Well, go ahead and knock," said Kensuke.  
“好了，去敲门吧，”健介说道。

"Why me," replied Hikari looking over her shoulder?  
“为什么是我，”光回头看着肩膀说？

"Because your the one that led us here idiot," said Touji.  
“因为你这个白痴带我们来的，”阿透说。

Hikari threw a scowl over her shoulder before taking a deep breadth and knocking twice on the door.  
光回头瞪了一眼，深吸一口气，然后敲了两下门。

After several seconds they thought they heard several footsteps and then the unlatching of the door. Whatever they had thought originally was blown out the door as Misato opened it.  
几秒钟后，他们以为听到了几声脚步声，接着是门闩被拉开的声音。无论他们最初的想法是什么，都在 Misato 打开门的那一刻被吹散了。

"Hai?" “嗨？”

Hikari, Kensuke, and Touji were unable to say a word. They hadn't been expecting this and for a moment were about to pass off the apartment number as a mistake when they heard Asuka's unmistakable voice coming from somewhere inside. Misato had a beer in one hand and the T.V. remote in the other. What's more she seemed to have adopted the Asuka attitude and decided to walk around the house in her underwear. Kensuke and Touji almost dropped dead of a bloody nose and it was only the dark aura that had settled around Hikari that kept them in check.  
光、真希波和东治一句话也说不出来。他们完全没有预料到这种情况，有那么一刻，他们几乎要把公寓号码当作一个错误时，突然听到了从屋内传来的明日香那 unmistakable 的声音。Misato 一手拿着啤酒，另一手拿着电视遥控器。更甚的是，她似乎采纳了明日香的态度，决定只穿着内衣在家里走来走去。真希波和东治差点因为鼻血喷涌而倒下，只有环绕在光周围的黑暗气场让他们保持了镇定。

"Ah you must be Asuka and Shinji's friends from school."  
"啊，你们一定是明日香和真嗣的学校朋友吧。"

Kensuke and Touji nodded with a hand over their noses while Hikari simply frowned.  
剑介和东治捂着鼻子点头，而光则只是皱了皱眉。

"Well I can understand why you'd be wondering about them. Coming to school oddly dressed and then not coming to school for two days, is a little odd."  
"嗯，我能理解你们为什么会对他们感到好奇。穿着奇怪的衣服来学校，然后又两天没来上学，确实有点奇怪。"

"We brought the homework they've missed," said Hikari speaking up.  
"我们带来了他们错过的作业。"光开口说道。

"Ah good. I was meaning to have someone pick it up but just didn't have the time."  
"啊，太好了。我正想着让人去取，但就是没时间。"

A small pause erupted as Touji and Kensuke continued to stare at Misato.  
短暂的停顿中，真治和健介继续盯着美里。

"Would you like to come in?"  
"你想进来吗？"

Kensuke and Touji practically leapt at the opportunity.  
真嗣和冬二几乎是一跃而起，抓住了这个机会。

After taking their shoes off hastily, they followed Misato into the living room were they could hear an odd assortment of noises going on.  
匆忙脱下鞋子后，他们跟着美里进了客厅，那里传来一阵奇怪的声响。

"Hey Shinji what's-" Though Kensuke was silenced as something went flying past him and struck the opposite wall.  
"嘿，真嗣，怎么了——" 但话未说完，肯斯克就被什么东西飞快地掠过，撞到了对面的墙上。

"DAMN IT BAKA! HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU TO NOT LAG BEHIND!"  
"该死的笨蛋！我得告诉你多少次，不要拖后腿！"

Touji had to cover his ears so they wouldn't explode from Asuka's outburst. Kensuke meanwhile had his hands over his head expecting to be dismembered any second. Realizing that Asuka's anger wasn't directed towards him, he turned towards his right to see what had flown past him. Shinji was sprawled in a heap against the wall with his legs sticking up in the air and his shoulders resting on the ground. He had a red foot mark on his cheek.  
托吉不得不捂住耳朵，以免被明日香的大吼震聋。肯斯克则双手抱头，以为自己随时会被撕成碎片。意识到明日香的怒火并非针对他，他转向右边，想看看刚才飞过去的是什么。真嗣瘫倒在墙边，双腿翘起，肩膀贴地，脸颊上有一个红色的脚印。

"Sh-Shinji?" “真-真嗣？”

Shinji realized then that other people were in the house besides him, Asuka, and Misato.  
那时，真嗣意识到房子里除了他、明日香和美里之外还有其他人。

"Kensuke? What are you doing here," he replied, moving around so he could see who else was in the room? Asuka apparently noticed that they weren't the only ones here either as she saw Hikari.  
“健介？你在这里做什么，”他回答道，移动位置以便能看到房间里还有谁？明日香显然也注意到他们不是唯一在场的人，因为她看到了光。

"Ah, the teacher wanted us to give you your homework for the past few days. Hikari tagged along to give Asuka hers as well."  
“啊，老师让我们把这几天的作业给你。光也跟着一起来给明日香送她的作业。”

"Ah thanks, I think. Homework was the furthest from my mind."  
"啊，谢谢，我想是的。作业完全不在我脑海里。"

"Same," replied Asuka. "一样，" 明日香回答道。"

"Well, if you two fall behind on your studies then I couldn't call myself a proper guardian," said Misato speaking up.  
"好吧，如果你们两个学业落后了，那我就不能称自己为称职的监护人了，" 美里开口说道。"

"But homework compared to this."  
“但和这个比起来，作业算什么。”

Hikari, Kensuke, and Touji suddenly realized what she ment by this. They were both wearing the same dancing outfits that they had worn to school that day, though it was what they were doing with them that seemed odd. In the middle of the living room was an odd looking contraption. The floor was covered with two large black mats that had oddly placed colors around it. In the back round of each was something that looked like a scoreboard. Currently each side showed zero.  
光、健介和透突然明白了她所说的‘这个’是什么意思。他们都穿着那天上学时的同款舞蹈服装，只不过他们用这些服装做的事情显得有些奇怪。客厅中央是一个看起来很奇怪的装置。地板上铺着两块巨大的黑色垫子，上面零星分布着奇怪的颜色。每块垫子后面都有个看起来像计分板的东西。目前两边都显示着零分。

Touji was about to open his mouth to ask if this is what Shinji and Asuka had been talking about when they were up on the roof three days ago when Kensuke elbowed him in the ribs. Hikari wasn't supposed to know about the Evangelions, and they weren't even sure if they were supposed to know.  
透正要开口问这是否就是真嗣和明日香三天前在屋顶上谈论的内容时，健介用胳膊肘撞了撞他的肋骨。光不应该知道关于 EVA 的事，他们甚至不确定自己是否应该知道。

"You two look as stupid as ever," said Touji commenting on their outfits.  
"你们俩看起来还是一如既往的蠢，" 冬二评论着他们的装扮。

"How bout I punch a hole clear through that smirking face of yours ass-hole," said Asuka acidly. That shut Touji up for a while.  
"要不我直接在你那张得意洋洋的脸上打个洞，混蛋，" 明日香尖刻地说道。这番话让冬二安静了一阵子。

"So what are you two supposed to be doing with this...odd thing?" Asked Hikari.  
"那么你们俩打算用这个...奇怪的东西做什么？" 光问道。

Asuka and Shinji both started stammering their own versions of things when Misato intervened. "Why don't you two just show them what you're doing. Its certainly a lot easier than explaining this."  
当美里介入时，明日香和真嗣都开始结结巴巴地各自解释。“你们俩为什么不直接展示给他们看呢？这肯定比解释要简单得多。”

"No! I don't want them to see me doing something this humiliating," said Asuka.  
“不！我不想让他们看到我做这么丢脸的事，”明日香说道。

Sighing Shinji said, "C'mon, Asuka. Lets just show them. Its not like we can embarrass ourselves any further."  
真嗣叹了口气说：“来吧，明日香。我们就给他们看看。反正我们也不可能再更尴尬了。”

Asuka turned towards him then with a glint in her eyes that could kill and Shinji almost took a step back.  
明日香转向他，眼中闪烁着能杀人的光芒，真嗣几乎下意识地后退了一步。

"Damn it, fine! But if you screw up again I'll break that damn scoreboard over your head!"  
“该死，好吧！但如果你再搞砸，我就会把那该死的计分板砸在你头上！”

"Hai, Hai. Lets just get this over with."  
“嗨，嗨。赶紧结束这一切吧。”

Asuka glared at him once more before taking her place own place on the mat next to his. After dawning both sets of headphones they both closed their eyes and their bodies started to move.  
明日香再次瞪了他一眼，然后在自己的位置上坐下，就在他旁边。两人都戴上耳机后，闭上眼睛，身体开始随着音乐舞动。

Hikari and the other two were both wide mouthed, gaping at the pair as they attempted to replicate each others movements based solely on the song. Misato, in the back round, had long stopped paying attention to how they were doing.  
光和另外两人都目瞪口呆，看着这对搭档试图仅凭歌曲来模仿对方的动作。美里在后面，早已不再关注他们的表现。

It was a bit depressing really. Shinji sped up and slowed down at random times while Asuka seemed to get faster and faster with each movement to the point where Shinji was about to pass out from trying to catch up. Very rarely did the score even get above five when Misato said that one hundred was a requirement for what they were doing. Though she didn't say what, since the other three weren't supposed to know of the Evangelions.  
这确实有点令人沮丧。真嗣时而加速时而减速，而明日香的动作却越来越快，快到真嗣几乎要因为追赶而晕倒。当美里说他们需要达到一百分时，分数很少能超过五分，尽管她没有说明原因，因为其他三人并不应该知道关于 EVA 的事情。

After a painful ten minutes Shinji finally tripped over his own feet in exhaustion and went face first down onto the floor. Asuka twitched slightly as she opened her eyes and saw a passed out Shinji on the floor and was just thinking of bashing him over the head with his own scoreboard when he stirred.  
经过痛苦的十分钟后，真嗣终于因疲惫不堪绊倒了自己的双脚，脸朝下摔在了地板上。明日香微微抽动了一下，睁开眼睛看到昏倒在地的真嗣，正想着用他的记分板敲他的头时，他动了动。

"Damn it! Why can't we do this."  
“该死！为什么我们做不到。”

"Its because you can't keep the pace."  
“那是因为你跟不上节奏。”

"No. You're moving at an inhuman pace. How the hell do you expect me to keep up with that!  
"不，你跑得跟非人类似的。你到底要我怎么跟得上那种速度！

"Baka, you're useless." "笨蛋，你真没用。

"You certainly can't be counted as perfect either."  
"你也不能算完美。

"Tch, I'm much better at this and piloting Eva then you'll ever be!"  
"哼，我在这方面和驾驶 Eva 比你强多了！"

"What's Eva?" "Eva 是什么？"

Shinji and Asuka spun towards at the sound of Hikari's voice while the others seemed to do the same, including Misato.  
听到 Hikari 的声音，Shinji 和 Asuka 转身望去，其他人似乎也做了同样的动作，包括 Misato。

"Eh heh... What Hikari?" Asked Asuka who's mouth was slightly twitching at the corners.  
"欸嘿...什么光？" 明日香问道，嘴角微微抽搐。

"I said what's Eva? Does it have something to do with this...thing?"  
"我说，Eva 是什么？它和这个...东西有关吗？"

"Ah well..." "啊，这个嘛..."

Sighing Misato sat up and quickly thought up a decent enough lie to make the situation pass by.  
叹了口气，美里坐起身来，迅速想出了一个还算过得去的谎言，让情况得以顺利过去。

"Eva is a game at the arcade that Asuka and Shinji compete against each sometimes. Shinji hasn't won once."  
“Eva 是游戏厅里的一款游戏，明日香和真嗣有时会互相对抗。真嗣一次都没赢过。”

"Hmmm? I don't think I've ever heard of that."  
“嗯？我想我从未听说过那个。”

"Ah...its fairly new," said Shinji catching on to the situation. Asuka appeared to be angry though at Misato's blatant lie. It made her look like a nerd.  
“啊……这还挺新的，”真嗣察觉到了情况，说道。虽然明日香看起来对美里明显的谎言感到愤怒，这让她显得像个书呆子。

"Well, I think these two need to get back to training. So I think that I'll have to ask you three to leave now," said a smiling Misato. Though in truth she was trying to reduce the effects of having the Evas spoken of.  
“嗯，我想这两个人需要回去训练了。所以我想我得请你们三位现在离开，”美里笑着说。虽然实际上她是在试图减少提及 EVA 的影响。

"Okay. When do you think you'll be back to school Shinji?"  
“好的。你觉得你什么时候能回学校，真嗣？”

"A week or so...maybe more."  
"大约一周...或许更久。"

"Okay I'll bring more homework in a few days."  
"好的，我过几天再带更多作业来。"

"Can't wait," grumbled Shinji.  
"等不及了，"真嗣咕哝道。

After Kensuke, Hikari, and Touji left Misato stormed into the living room only to find Shinji and Asuka in another heated argument.  
在真嗣、美里和冬二离开后，律子怒气冲冲地走进客厅，却发现真希波和绫人在激烈争吵。

"HEY!" "嘿！"

Asuka and Shinji stopped yelling in each others faces briefly to turn and see an angry, red faced, Misato.  
真希波和绫人暂时停止了面对面的争吵，转头看向满脸通红、怒气冲冲的律子。

"Do you two have any idea how close you were to letting the world know about the Evangelions."  
"你们俩知不知道刚才差点就让全世界知道 EVA 的存在了。"

"Is it that big a deal?"  
"有那么严重吗？"

"Of course it is! While their aren't many in existence if regular citizens knew about them then they'd want to start sticking around during battles and taking pictures. Not to mention every child your age would want to pilot one."  
"当然严重！虽然 EVA 数量不多，但如果普通市民知道了，他们就会想在战斗时围观拍照。更别提每个像你这么大的孩子都会想成为驾驶员。"

Shinji snorted. After five minutes in an entry plug they'd be having second thoughts.  
真嗣哼了一声。在插入栓里待上五分钟，他们就会开始犹豫了。

"Anyway break time over, back to work."  
“总之，休息时间结束，回去工作。”

Both Shinji and Asuka continued laying there though. Neither of them wanting to be the first one to stand, though it was Asuka that broke the silence.  
然而，真嗣和明日香仍然躺在那里。谁也不想第一个站起来，尽管是明日香打破了沉默。

"Why bother doing this anymore. Its obvious that we can't do this because I'm just so much better than this baka is."  
“为什么还要费这个劲。很明显我们做不了这个，因为我比这个笨蛋强太多了。”

"Okay Asuka," said Misato as a smirk started to develop across her face. "I can either bring in Rei and her and Shinji can start practicing this for the battle against the angel. Or you can match your speed to Shinji's and continue with this."  
“好吧，明日香，”美里说着，脸上开始浮现出一丝得意的笑容。“我可以叫来绫波，她和真嗣可以开始为对抗使徒的战斗练习。或者你可以调整你的速度，和真嗣一起继续。”

Asuka opened her mouth at first to yell out an angry retort, but then ended up shutting it. Above all else she didn't want the first child and Shinji taking part in the operation. It would seriously hurt her pride if she wasn't able to complete this.  
明日香一开始张嘴想要怒吼反驳，但最终还是闭上了嘴。最重要的是，她不希望第一适格者和真嗣参与这次行动。如果她不能完成这个任务，那会严重伤害她的自尊。

"Fine! I'll slow down!" Sitting up promptly, she grabbed Shinji's wrist and started dragging him over to the machine.  
“好啦！我会慢点！”她迅速坐起身，抓住真嗣的手腕，开始拉着他向机器走去。

"Eh Asuka, wait." “哎，明日香，等等。”

"I'm not waiting and I'm certainly not wasting all the hard work that we've done by giving this to Rei."  
“我不会等，更不会因为要把这个给丽而浪费我们所有的努力。”

"Err, what hard work?" "呃，什么辛苦活？"

Asuka turned towards Shinji and threw him one of her usual glares before saying, "Just get on your damn mat."  
明日香转向真嗣，朝他投去她惯常的瞪视，然后说道：“赶紧上你的垫子。”

"You don't have to be so forceful."  
"你不必这么强硬。"

"I just want to get this over with."  
"我只是想快点结束这件事。"

"Hai, Hai. Same here." "是啊，是啊。我也是。"

After sometime later Misato glanced over at the two who had not moved from the mats since they had agreed on finishing it. With a slight grin on her face she thought, 'I suppose that we might start seeing some results,' as she glanced at the scoreboard to see that they had reached fifteen as their highest score.  
过了一段时间后，美里瞥向那两个自从同意完成任务后就没从垫子上动过的人。她脸上带着一丝微笑，心想：'我想我们可能会开始看到一些成果了，'同时她瞥了一眼记分牌，看到他们已经达到了十五分，这是他们的最高分。

'Well, they still have a ways to go,' she sighed as she saw Asuka ripping off her headphones and smacking Shinji in the face.  
'唉，他们还有很长的路要走，'她叹息着，看到明日香扯下耳机，猛地扇了真嗣一巴掌。

---

"Ah that feels so much better," sighed Asuka as she stepped into the living room with a wet towel draped over her head. It was many hours after they had finished their day of training and were rather proud of themselves as they had reached twenty on the high score.  
“啊，这样感觉好多了，”明日香叹道，她头上搭着一条湿毛巾走进客厅。距离他们结束一天的训练已经过去好几个小时了，他们颇为自豪，因为在高分榜上达到了二十名。

After looking around quickly, she realized that Shinji was the only one in the living room.  
她迅速环顾四周，意识到客厅里只有真嗣一个人。

"Oi baka, where did Misato go?"  
"喂，笨蛋，美里去哪儿了？"

"She mentioned something about going to a bar," said Shinji as he idly turned a page of the book he was reading.  
"她提到了去酒吧的事，" 真嗣一边说着，一边漫不经心地翻着他正在读的书的一页。"

"Tch. Why is she always gone during nights? Whether its work or drinking, she's rarely home."  
"啧。为什么她晚上总是不在？无论是工作还是喝酒，她很少在家。"

"Maybe thats just something that comes with being an adult."  
"或许这就是成为成年人的一部分吧。"

"Well I certainly hope I'm not like Misato when I'm her age. Anyway same rules apply as usual."  
"嗯，我当然希望我到她那个年纪时不会像美里那样。总之，和往常一样，规则不变。"

"You don't have to keep reminding me," said Shinji as he turned his head towards her. Asuka had moved from the doorway and was kneeling over her futon.  
"你不必一直提醒我，" 真嗣说着，将头转向她。明日香已经从门口走过来，跪在她的被褥旁。

"I Don't Trust You!" "我不信任你！"

"If I haven't done anything to you the first three nights, what makes you think I'd do something tonight."  
"如果我前三个晚上都没对你做什么，你凭什么认为我今晚会有所行动。"

Asuka scowled at him for a moment before spinning around and turning on the T.V.  
明日香瞪了他一会儿，然后转身打开了电视。

"Baka!" "笨蛋！"

Shinji simply shrugged and went back to reading. It was really the same thing every night. So far, before they decided to go to bed, Asuka would draw the line that he was not allowed to pass and remind him not to do anything perverted. To that he would usually reply with some sarcastic comment that would tick her off. Though he wasn't really in the mood for it tonight.  
真嗣只是耸了耸肩，继续阅读。每晚都是如此。到目前为止，在他们决定上床睡觉之前，明日香会划出他不能逾越的界限，并提醒他不要做任何变态的事情。对此，他通常会用一些讽刺的评论来回应，让她生气。不过今晚他真的没心情这么做。

Closing the book he was reading Shinji sat up and said, "Not that I expect it but is their any hot water left for another shower."  
合上正在阅读的书，真嗣坐起身来说道：“虽然我不抱希望，但还有热水可以再洗个澡吗？”

Without turning around Asuka mumbled, "Find out for yourself, baka."  
明日香没有转身，咕哝着说：“自己去找，笨蛋。”

Needlessly to say, several minutes later, Shinji was cursing as the cold water hit his face.  
无需多言，几分钟后，真嗣便在冷水拍打脸颊时咒骂起来。

---

After the first night of sleeping together in the same room they both became quickly accustomed to it. Its not like they were sleeping in the same bed or anything. Even so, Shinji drifted in and out of sleep occasionally. Sometimes it was due to dreams, of which he'd rather not remember, and other times it was because Asuka seemed to wake him up. Though not on purpose as it was usually through her mumbling. Shinji was an unusually light sleeper.  
自从第一晚同处一室后，他们很快就适应了这种生活。并非同床共枕，即便如此，真嗣还是时不时地陷入半梦半醒之间。有时是因为梦境，那些他宁愿遗忘的梦，有时则是因为明日香似乎在无意中吵醒了他，通常是通过她的喃喃自语。真嗣是个异常浅眠的人。

Tonight though, a dream he had been having within the past two days woke him up suddenly.  
然而今晚，过去两天里反复出现的梦境突然将他惊醒。

Shinji's eyes flew open as the dream ended and he sat up, shivering uncontrollably. Cold sweat clung to his body and dripped off his forehead and he suddenly had an urge to rip off the loose tank-top that he was wearing.  
梦醒时分，真嗣的双眼猛地睁开，他坐起身来，无法控制地颤抖着。冷汗浸透了他的身体，从额头上滴落，他突然有种冲动，想要扯掉身上那件宽松的背心。

Running a weary hand down his face, wiping off some of the sweat in the process, he glanced over at the pile of blankets that was Asuka.  
他疲惫地用手抹了一把脸，顺便擦去了一些汗水，然后瞥向那堆毯子，那里躺着的是明日香。

'Good,' he thought. 'I didn't wake her.'  
“还好，”他心想，“没吵醒她。”

Turning back to his dreams he tried to recall it, but he could only remember small details. It was like trying to keep water in your cupped hands. He could only remember the same thing from the past nights and that seemed to be some stranger ringing the door bell at Misato's apartment. Shinji had then gone to open the door and was greeted with a tall man in an overcoat who had sunken white eyes. Shinji knew that he had never seen somebody like that in his life and wondered why he would be dreaming something like that. The man spoke several words but Shinji was never able to hear them as the dreaming started dissolving at that point.  
他转而回想自己的梦境，试图记起细节，但只能捕捉到零星片段，犹如试图用双手捧住水一般。他只能回忆起过去几晚的相同情景，似乎是有人在真嗣的公寓按门铃。真嗣随后去开门，迎面是一个身穿大衣、眼窝深陷的白眼男子。真嗣确信自己从未在生活中见过这样的人，不禁疑惑为何会梦到这样的情景。那男子说了几句话，但真嗣始终听不清，因为梦境此时开始消散。

Flopping back down in his own pile of blankets he racked his brain again to think if he had ever seen anybody that might even mildly fit the description. Though nothing clicked.  
他颓然倒回自己的被褥堆中，再次绞尽脑汁回想是否曾见过任何与描述稍稍相符的人。然而，毫无头绪。

He could only ascertain this as something to do with his visions, which he now guessed were starting to get stronger. Though he had no idea how this man was related to them.  
他只能推测这与他的幻觉有关，如今他猜测这些幻觉正变得越来越强烈。尽管他完全不知道这个男人与它们有何关联。

Turning over on his side he closed his eyes for a moment and opened them again in a flash when he heard movement on the other side of the room. Seemed that Asuka was restless again.  
他侧身翻转，闭上眼睛片刻，随即又因听到房间另一侧的动静而猛地睁开。看来明日香又失眠了。

She was tossing and turning again like the previous nights and was mumbling something indistinguishable. The first time that this had happened Shinji had almost gotten up and woken her, but thought better at then end as she would certainly abuse him afterwards. Though each time it tugged at his heart a little.  
她像前几晚一样辗转反侧，嘴里嘟囔着听不清的话语。第一次发生这种情况时，真嗣差点起身叫醒她，但最终还是理智占了上风，因为她醒来后肯定会对他大发雷霆。尽管每次都让他的心微微揪紧。

Here was practically the complete opposite of the Asuka that he knew. A girl that didn't want to show her helplessness, but was most helpless while she was sleeping. Shinji could only guess what her dreams were like as she relived her past repetitively. It was the times that she whimpered and called out for her mom that particularly pushed the boundaries of his resolve to not cross that invisible line. And it seemed that tonight was such a night as he heard her mumble a few words in which he caught, Mom and go. If Shinji had to guess she was begging her mom to not leave her.  
这几乎是他所认识的明日香完全相反的一面。一个不愿展现无助的女孩，却在睡梦中最为无助。真嗣只能猜测她的梦境，她一遍遍重温过去的梦。每当她呜咽着呼唤妈妈时，特别考验他不去逾越那条无形界限的决心。今晚似乎又是这样的夜晚，他听到她含糊地说了几个词，捕捉到了“妈妈”和“走”。如果真嗣要猜，她大概是在恳求妈妈不要离开她。

Really he wasn't sure how much more he could take as he rolled back over trying to ignore her whimpering. What was he supposed to do? Rush over there, embrace her, and whisper into her ear that everything was going to be okay and that he was going to protect her. He'd get a swift kick to the groin for even thinking about that.  
真的，他不确定自己还能承受多少，当他翻身回去试图忽略她的呜咽声时。他该怎么办？冲过去，拥抱她，对着她的耳朵低语一切都会好起来的，他会保护她。光是这么想，他都觉得自己会狠狠地挨上一脚。

After several minutes of her mumbling as his mind argued back and forth, she finally seemed to settle down. Shinji therefore let out an audible sigh at the ceiling and closed his eyes as though relishing in the piece. Though something tugged at the back of his head and he heard a familiar voice say, "Coward."  
经过几分钟她喃喃自语，他的内心反复争论，她终于似乎平静了下来。于是，真嗣对着天花板长长地叹了口气，闭上了眼睛，仿佛在享受这份宁静。然而，有什么东西在他脑海中拉扯，他听到一个熟悉的声音说：“懦夫。”

Sitting bolt upright in his makeshift bed he spun to his right, only to see somebody that he wished he never had to look at again. What he called pseudo Asuka was staring back at him while sitting on the ground with her back against the couch which was pushed up against the wall.  
他猛地坐直在临时床上，转身向右，却看到了一个他希望永远不必再见的人。他称之为伪明日香的人正坐在地上，背靠着推到墙边的沙发，回望着他。

Shinji mouth seemed to gape openly, unable to contemplate what was going on. Though after she seemed to sneer at him, he came to his senses. Still unsure whether it was in his mind or not he hissed into the room, "What the hell are you doing here? I thought that I was done with you."  
真嗣的嘴巴似乎张得大大的，无法理解正在发生的事情。尽管在她似乎对他嗤之以鼻后，他恢复了理智。仍然不确定这是否是他的错觉，他对着房间低声说道，“你到底在这里做什么？我以为我已经和你没关系了。”

"Ah did you miss me?"  
“啊，你想我了吗？”

"Tch. As if." “哼，怎么可能。”

"I feel heartbroken. Well, I suppose thats an understatement for what's to come anyway."  
"我感觉心碎了。好吧，我想这还不足以形容即将发生的事情。"

It took Shinji half a second to respond to this statement and he nearly shouted it.  
真嗣花了半秒钟回应这句话，他几乎是大声喊出来的。

"What the hell do you mean!"  
"你到底是什么意思！"

"Calm down, you'll find out soon enough. Anyway why aren't you comforting her. If you were in her position how would you feel?"  
"冷静点，你很快就会知道了。话说回来，你为什么不安慰她呢？如果你处在她的位置，你会怎么想？"

"I have no idea because I can hardly read her."  
"我完全摸不透她的心思，所以无从得知。"

"Maybe you should try?" "或许你应该试试看？"

"Why bother. Every time I do she just rebukes me."  
"何必费心呢。每次我这么做，她都只是斥责我。"

"Didn't seem like that last time. You two were all over each other."  
"上次可不像那样。你们俩亲密得不得了。"

"Y-You know about that?" "你……你知道那件事？"

"Course I know about that baka!"  
"当然我知道那个笨蛋！"

Shinji had a sudden urge to laugh at her use of the Asuka he knew favorite phrase. It was so similar.  
真嗣突然有种想笑的冲动，因为她用了他所熟悉的明日香最喜欢的那句话。太相似了。

"So did you just start talking to me again to torment me some more."  
"所以你又开始跟我说话，就是为了再折磨我一番吗？"

"Mah...you could say that I guess."  
"嗯...可以这么说吧，我想。"

"You don't sound to sure."  
"你听起来不太确定。"

"I can't tell you to much. I'm merely here to see how your decisions change things."  
"我不能告诉你太多。我只是来看看你的决定如何改变一切。"

"Full of helpful information as usual."  
"一如既往地充满有用信息。"

"Arigato." "谢谢。"

"Whatever..." "随便吧..."

After a small pause pseudo Asuka asked, "If she sincerely asked you to help her...would you be able to? If she asked you to throw away your humanity for her, could you do it? If she asked you to forsake everybody you knew for herself would you be able to go through with it?"  
短暂的停顿后，伪明日香问道：“如果她真心请求你帮助她……你能做到吗？如果她要求你为她抛弃人性，你能做到吗？如果她要求你为她背弃所有你认识的人，你能狠下心去做吗？”

Shinji turned his head to look at the back of the Asuka that he knew. Sighing he said, "What relevance does that have. Why would she ask something like that in the first place."  
真嗣转头看向他熟悉的明日香背影。叹了口气，他说：“那有什么关系。她为什么要问这种问题。”

"Well, you can't deny that the first option is a possibility. The other two are more to explain my point."  
“好吧，你不能否认第一个选项是有可能的。后两个更多的是为了说明我的观点。”

"No...I suppose I can't."  
"不...我想我不能。"

"And? You haven't answered my question."  
"然后呢？你还没回答我的问题。"

"I'd like to hope I would. After what we've been through."  
"我希望能相信我会。经历了这么多之后。"

"Thats a rather easy way to avoid the answer."  
"那是个相当简单的逃避回答的方式。"

"Well excuse me for still not understanding what you're getting at."  
"好吧，原谅我还没弄明白你的意思。"

"Fine let me put it bluntly. If her entire world came crashing down on top of her, would you be able to stand under her and protect her from the falling pieces of everything that has happened to her?"  
"好吧，让我直截了当地说。如果她的整个世界轰然崩塌，你能否站在她身下，保护她免受那些坠落的一切碎片的伤害？"

"..."

"Well?" "那么？"

"...Yes..." "...是的..."

Springing up the pseudo Asuka grinned and said, "Glad to hear it. I'll hold you to that."  
伪装的明日香跳起来，咧嘴一笑说："很高兴听你这么说。我会记住你这句话的。"

The last thing that Shinji could remember before he drifted off to sleep was the pseudo Asuka smiling back at him and he suddenly wished that his Asuka would be able smile that serenely one day too.  
在昏昏欲睡之前，真嗣能记得的最后一件事是伪明日香对他微笑，他突然希望自己的明日香有一天也能那样宁静地微笑。

---

In almost no time at all the day that they were supposed to fight the angel again arrived. They had finally achieved a hundred percent the night before and Shinji was rather nervous as he tried to chew his cereal with a mouth that refused to work. Asuka seemed to be rather jittery also as she was tapping her index finger repeatedly on the table.  
几乎转眼间，他们再次与使徒战斗的日子就到了。前一晚他们终于达到了百分百同步率，真嗣紧张得试图用无法工作的嘴巴咀嚼麦片。明日香似乎也很紧张，她不停地用食指敲打着桌子。

After roughly an hour of nervous waiting, during which Shinji suggested they squeeze in some last minute practice at which Asuka just snarled at, the time arrived. Misato left a message on Asuka's phone letting them know that all preparation had been taken care of and that they were ready for them.  
在大约一个小时的紧张等待后，期间真嗣提议进行一些最后的练习，结果被明日香咆哮着拒绝了，时间到了。美里在明日香的手机上留言，告诉他们所有准备工作已经完成，他们已经准备就绪。

"Well lets go..." "好吧，我们走..."

Shinji just nodded silently. She must have been really nervous to not tack on her usual trade mark.  
真嗣只是默默地点了点头。她一定是真的很紧张，以至于没有加上她平常的标志性话语。

After a hasty drive to Nerv, Shinji and Asuka quickly dawned their plug suits and were listening to a rant that Ritsuko was giving about the anatomy of the angel that they were facing. Though Shinji wasn't quite listening.  
匆忙驱车到达 NERV 后，真嗣和明日香迅速穿上插入栓服，听着律子关于他们即将面对的天使解剖结构的训话。不过真嗣并没有怎么听。

When they had first entered Nerv earlier he was surprised to see Rei waiting for them. Without speaking to them she had escorted them to the command center and had so far been standing silently in the back round next to Misato, who was chewing on a finger nail. If Shinji had to honestly say it might be very well because of Rei that they had even achieved the hundred percent.  
当他们初次进入 Nerv 时，他惊讶地看到绫波在等他们。她没有和他们说话，而是带领他们来到指挥中心，至今一直静静地站在后方的 Misato 旁边，Misato 正在咬着指甲。如果真嗣要老实说，很可能正是因为绫波，他们才达到了百分百的成就。

True to his words, Kensuke had returned two days after the initial visit while dragging Touji along with him. Though instead of Hikari tagging along it was Rei, of which Kensuke and Touji didn't seem to keen on walking with. Shinji could only guess at the lack of conversation. Though one good thing did seem to come out of her visit. At her sudden appearance Asuka seemed to put on a spur of motivation and had seemed much keener on working together with Shinji then the usual yelling and abusing. Shinji attested this to the fact that Asuka always enjoyed showing her superiority, and didn't miss a change to prove she was better than Rei. While Rei wasn't the most social person he had ever meet Shinji had gotten used to her personality to borderline enjoying her company, even if it was silent.  
正如他所说，真希在初次访问后的两天回来了，同时拖着阿薰一起。虽然不是光跟着，而是绫波，真希和阿薰似乎不太愿意和她一起走。真嗣只能猜测是因为缺乏对话。不过，她的来访确实带来了一件好事。在她突然出现时，明日香似乎突然充满了动力，比平时更愿意与真嗣合作，而不是大喊大叫和辱骂。真嗣认为这是因为明日香总是喜欢展示自己的优越性，从不放过证明自己比绫波更优秀的机会。虽然绫波不是他见过的最社交化的人，但真嗣已经习惯了她的性格，甚至到了几乎享受她陪伴的地步，即使她是沉默的。

"Got that Asuka?" “明白了吗，明日香？”

"Yeah, yeah," said Asuka replying to Ritsuko's long winded explanation.  
“是是是，”明日香对律子冗长的解释回应道。

"Shinji, got it?" “真嗣，明白了吗？”

Shinji seemed to be dragged out of his revere and looked at her before mumbling, "Huh...oh, yeah." He couldn't remember a thing she had just said.  
真嗣似乎被从沉思中拉了出来，看着她，含糊地应道：“啊……哦，明白了。”他一点儿也不记得她刚才说了什么。

"If you understand then get in your Eva's and prepare for deployment," said a slightly disgruntled Misato.  
"如果你明白了，就进入你的 Eva，准备部署，" 米萨托有些不满地说道。

"What's her problem," asked Asuka?  
"她有什么问题，" 明日香问道？

Shrugging, Shinji followed her as the two prepared to enter their respected units.  
耸了耸肩，真嗣跟着她，两人准备进入各自的机体。

---

Even though they had trained rigorously they still had to adapt that training to be used while piloting Eva. They had therefore been repeatedly told that Eva was just like an extension of their own body. With this mind set they should be able to defeat the angel while it split separately. There was of course that slight roadblock that they always seemed to experience: There constant bickering with each other. Though Misato hoped that they could overcome if for at least a minute.  
尽管他们经过了严格的训练，但仍需将这些训练适应于驾驶 Eva 的过程中。因此，他们反复被告知，Eva 就像是他们身体的延伸。有了这种心态，他们应该能够在天使分裂时击败它。当然，总是有一个小小的障碍：他们之间的不断争吵。尽管 Misato 希望他们至少能克服这一点，哪怕只有一分钟。

After extensive trial and error they had finally come up with a way to defeat the angel. While seeming to be stronger while separated, Ritsuko had determined that the overall structure of the angels body was weaker than while one. This was due to the fact that the split originated after constant cells reproduction. Cells have a set limit that they are able to reproduce for and it seemed that an angel was no exception. It was still considered a living organism.  
经过反复试验和错误，他们终于找到了击败天使的方法。虽然分开时看似更强大，但 Ritsuko 确定天使的整体结构在合体时更为脆弱。这是因为分裂发生在细胞不断复制之后。细胞有其复制次数的限制，而天使也不例外。它仍然被视为一个活生生的有机体。

Therefore a plan was put into play to force the angel to become one again so its core could be destroyed all at once. By attacking the separated angels simultaneously within a gap of one minute it was hoped that it would become whole again.  
因此，制定了一个计划，迫使天使重新合体，以便一次性摧毁其核心。通过在一分钟的时间间隔内同时攻击分裂的天使，希望它能重新合体。

"I'm turning the music on you two and putting a silence on all radio's. I don't want any interference while we enact this," said Misato over the intercom.  
“我要对你们俩播放音乐，并让所有电台静音。在我们执行任务时，我不希望有任何干扰，”美里通过对讲机说道。

Shinji let out a sigh as he tried to loosen himself up a little. This was not a time to have tense nerves. He guessed that Asuka was doing something similar next to him.  
真嗣叹了口气，试图让自己放松一点。现在不是紧张的时候。他猜想明日香也在旁边做着类似的事情。

Once again he heard the familiar sound of the classical music that they had become accustomed to this last week. Even after listening to it almost every waking second of the past days he still enjoyed it.  
他又听到了那熟悉的古典音乐声，这是他们过去一周已经习惯的声音。尽管在过去的日子里几乎每时每刻都在听，他仍然喜欢它。

"Ba...Shinji? You ready?"  
"Ba...Shinji？准备好了吗？"

Shinji almost laugh as she caught herself before calling him an idiot. "Yeah, lets go."  
Shinji 差点笑出声，她及时阻止了自己叫他白痴。“嗯，走吧。”

Simultaneously the two Eva's stood up from their kneeling position next to the two elevator shafts and did a front flip over the two buildings in front of them. It was really quite comical to see two giant robots doing acrobatics.  
同时，两台 Eva 从跪坐在两个电梯井旁的位置站起，向前翻跃过它们面前的两栋建筑。看到两个巨型机器人做杂技动作，真是相当滑稽。

"Asuka do you-" "明日香，你——"

"Yeah I see the bastards!"  
"没错，我看到那些混蛋了！"

Far off on their monitor screen they could distinguish two small dots far off in the ocean, just starting to emerge out of the water. They had specific instruction to not engage the angel while it was still in the water. It would hinder their movements if they tried fighting in the water.  
在他们的监视屏幕上，可以看到远处海洋中有两个小点，刚刚开始从水中冒出来。他们接到的指令是在使徒还在水中时不要进行攻击。如果在水中战斗，会妨碍他们的行动。

After a hectic minute the separate angel finally brought its feet onto dry land.  
经过一番忙乱，那只独立的精灵终于将双脚踏上了干燥的陆地。

Without waiting for a sign from the other, both Eva's bolted towards the beach at break neck speed. It was really a marvel at how well they were working together now. Before if they had tried something so simplistic they would have ended up bashing against each others elbows. Now they ran in a direct line next to each other, shoulder to shoulder, neither getting ahead of the other.  
不等对方发出信号，伊娃们便以惊人的速度冲向海滩。现在她们合作得如此默契，真是令人惊叹。以前如果尝试这样简单的动作，她们肯定会互相撞到对方的肘部。现在她们并肩奔跑，肩并肩，谁也没有超过谁，沿着一条直线前进。

As they neared the beach they both turned, and in a wide arc circled around so that they were position to the far left and right of their respected angels. Kicking off against the sand, they both tore towards the angel they had chosen. Sensing danger the two angels jumped high into the air, creating a large dust storm in the air.  
当她们接近海滩时，两人同时转身，以一个大弧度绕行，分别位于各自精灵的左、右两侧。她们踢起沙子，向选定的精灵疾驰而去。感受到危险，两只精灵高高跃起，在空中掀起了一阵巨大的沙尘暴。

The two Eva's didn't halt their pace until they had arrived directly under the angel. Just before colliding into each other, the two jumped high into the air, higher then the two angels. Turning around in mid air the two Eva's brought both of their right legs back, and dropped them with a sickening crack on top of the angels heads.  
两位 Eva 并未停下脚步，直到她们直接抵达天使的下方。就在即将相撞的前一刻，她们高高跃起，超越了两名天使。在半空中转身，两位 Eva 将各自的右腿后撤，然后以令人毛骨悚然的碎裂声猛击在天使的头顶。

Flying back towards the ground the separate angels repositioned themselves and landed with a thud on the soft sand.  
分开的两位天使飞回地面，重新调整位置，重重地落在柔软的沙地上，发出一声闷响。

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

Without having to think Shinji directed Unit 01's hand towards Unit 02. The two hands grasped each other and they both rocketed towards the ground.  
无需多想，真嗣指挥初号机将手伸向二号机。两只手紧紧相握，她们一同向地面疾驰而去。

Using the momentum that they had gained as the soared towards the ground, the two Eva's dug their feet into the sand. With hands still clasped, they placed them on the sand, palms directed downward and kicked outwards. The kicking was however met by a stronger AT-field from the combined efforts of the angels and their kick was forcefully blocked.  
借助向地面俯冲的势头，两台 EVA 将脚深深插入沙中。双手依旧紧握，他们将手掌朝下放在沙地上，然后向外踢出。然而，这一踢却被天使们合力形成的更强大的 AT 力场强行阻挡。

Breaking off the AT-field the two angels lashed out with their clawed hands trying to slash into the armor of the two Eva's. Flipping backwards the two Eva's were easily able to dodge the oncoming attack.  
两台 EVA 打破 AT 力场，天使们伸出利爪试图撕裂 EVA 的装甲。EVA 们向后翻滚，轻松躲过了迎面而来的攻击。

"Damn it! How the hell are we supposed to defeat them if they use their AT-field like that!"  
“该死！如果他们那样使用 AT 力场，我们到底该怎么打败他们！”

"Calm down Asuka." “冷静点，明日香。”

She surprisingly relented and asked, "You got any ideas?"  
她出乎意料地让步了，问道：“你有什么主意吗？”

"Maybe...I mean, its worth a try I suppose."  
“或许吧...我是说，这值得一试，我想。”

"Fine! Direct me!" "好吧！给我指路！"

Shinji was rather taken aback at her willingness to listen to him but quickly told her what he wanted her to do. She didn't particularly like the idea, but she had to admit that it could work.  
真嗣对她的愿意听从感到相当意外，但他很快告诉了她希望她做的事情。她对这个主意并不特别喜欢，但她不得不承认这可能行得通。

"Fine I got it," said Asuka as she quickly position herself in front of her angel.  
"好吧，我明白了，" 明日香说着，迅速站到了她的使徒面前。

Glancing at the time limit they had left Shinji was startled that they had a little over a minute before the five minutes since the umbilical cord had been detached.  
瞥了一眼剩余的时间限制，真嗣惊讶地发现他们只剩下不到一分钟的时间，自从脐带电缆被断开已经过去了五分钟。

Again, without any means of signaling, the two Eva's dashed forward again toward their respected angels, which Shinji had noticed had been hovering close to each other. If he had guessed correctly they would solely rely on defense until they found an opening to attack. After the first attack they had ushered in, the angels had stuck close to each other so to protect each other.  
再次，由于没有任何信号手段，两台 EVA 再次向各自的目标天使冲去，真嗣注意到这些天使已经彼此靠近悬浮。如果他猜得没错，它们将完全依靠防御，直到找到攻击的空隙。自从第一次攻击后，天使们就一直紧靠在一起，以保护彼此。

It seemed Shinji's theory was correct. As the two Eva's neared their targets the angels generated an AT-field larger than the last one. However, simultaneously, the two Eva's generated their own AT-field to counteract the angels AT-field.  
看来真嗣的理论是正确的。当两台 EVA 接近目标时，天使们生成了一个比上次更大的 AT 力场。然而，与此同时，两台 EVA 也生成了自己的 AT 力场来抵消天使的 AT 力场。

During the fight against Ramiel, Shinji had learned something about AT-fields. A large key to the power of an AT-field was emotions. He had remembered that he wanted to defeat the angel no matter what and had generated that large AT-field and ripped apart the flesh of the angel. He had hoped that the same could be applied to this. It seemed like he was right.  
在与雷米尔的战斗中，真嗣对 AT 力场有了新的认识。AT 力场的强大关键在于情感。他记得自己无论如何都要击败天使，于是生成了强大的 AT 力场，撕裂了天使的肉体。他希望同样的原理也能应用于此。看来他是对的。

He had told Asuka about his hunch, though not specifically saying why he thought that. She agreed that they could give it a shot. So Shinji had told Asuka to think of nothing other than defeating the angel.  
他向明日香透露了自己的直觉，但没有具体说明为什么这么想。她同意可以一试。于是真嗣告诉明日香，除了击败天使之外，什么都不要想。

He wasn't sure if the same mentality could be applied to an angel. Certainly an angel was a living organism, in the sense that it had flesh and organs. But did it have emotions? Could an angel relish in victory or stew in defeat? Did an angel even have a sense of existence?  
他不确定同样的思维方式是否适用于天使。当然，从拥有肉体和器官的角度来看，天使是生物。但它有情感吗？天使会享受胜利或沉浸在失败中吗？天使甚至有存在的意识吗？

Throwing away his hesitancy he projected all his thoughts into defeating what was directly in front of him. Next to him he could feel that Asuka was doing the same thing, and that their wishes and desires were starting to overlap. It was then that Shinji felt the separate AT-fields become one. He supposed that something had actually come out of going to school dressed in that horrendous outfit.  
他抛开犹豫，将所有思绪集中在击败眼前的敌人上。他能感觉到身旁的明日香也在做同样的事，他们的愿望和渴望开始重叠。就在那时，真嗣感觉到各自的 AT 力场合而为一。他想，穿上那套可怕的校服去上学，总算还是有所收获。

Slowly the angel was pushed backwards as the AT-field grew and the angels feet started sliding across the sand. Shinji finally saw a large crack happening in the angels AT-field and next second it shattered.  
随着 AT 力场的增强，天使缓缓后退，双脚开始在沙地上滑动。真嗣终于看到天使的 AT 力场出现了一道巨大的裂缝，下一秒便彻底破碎。

Without even hesitating, Asuka and Shinji followed up the shattering of the AT-field with a quick spin kick to the chest. The separate angels stumbled backwards and was about to produce another AT-field. Though Shinji didn't give them a chance.  
毫不犹豫地，明日香和真嗣在 AT 力场破碎后迅速跟进，对准胸口施以旋转踢击。两个天使踉跄后退，正要再次生成 AT 力场。但真嗣没有给他们机会。

Dropping down low he swung his Eva's legs out knocking the angel off his feet. Meanwhile, as Shinji had ducked down, Asuka had jumped over him and with a sickening crunch, drove her Eva's balled up fist into the side of the angels head.  
他俯身一跃，用 Eva 的双腿将天使击倒在地。与此同时，真嗣蹲下之际，明日香从他头顶跃过，伴随着一声令人毛骨悚然的碎裂声，她用 Eva 紧握的拳头猛击天使的头部侧面。

While still on the ground Shinji grabbed onto Asuka's Eva's arm and spun her like a ballerina backwards as the fallen angel next to the one she had decked tried to get retribution. With its failed attack Shinji quickly grabbed its outstretched arm and bent it backwards. Over the sound of the bone snapping a loud roar could be heard escaping the angels lopsided mouth. The shock wave sent Unit 01 skidding backwards across the sand, though Shinji felt himself stop suddenly as Unit 02 grabbed his Eva's shoulders and held him steady.  
真嗣仍躺在地上，抓住明日香 Eva 的手臂，像芭蕾舞者一样将她向后旋转，而旁边被击倒的天使试图报复。在它攻击失败后，真嗣迅速抓住其伸出的手臂并反向弯曲。随着骨头断裂的声音，一声巨吼从天使歪斜的口中传出。冲击波使初号机在沙地上滑行后退，但真嗣感到自己突然停了下来，因为二号机抓住了他的 Eva 的肩膀，稳住了他。

"Thanks, Asuka." “谢谢你，明日香。”

"No problem." "没问题。"

Shinji ended up smiling even though he knew that Asuka hadn't seen. Next second though his smile turned to a frown as he saw what the angel was doing. Apparently it had finally given up the split and was starting to become one gain."  
尽管知道明日香没看见，真嗣还是不由自主地笑了。但下一秒，他的笑容就变成了皱眉，因为他看到了使徒在做什么。显然，它终于放弃了分裂，开始重新合为一体。

"Asuka..." "明日香……"

"Tch. Finally." "啧，终于。"

Shinji watched as the sides that had fused together seemed to slide off as tendons and nerves were dislocated from the main part of the body. It was like watching one side of a wall that had wet paint and one that was dry. The wet side was dripping while the dry side stayed firm.  
真嗣看着那些原本融合在一起的部分，仿佛随着肌腱和神经从主体分离而滑落。就像一面墙，一边是湿漉漉的油漆，另一边已经干透。湿的那边在滴落，而干的那边依然坚固。

Large pieces of flesh started to fall off and instantly turned black and started to break apart and decompose on the sands of the beach. Putrid black blood leaked out of the half organs that were left to rot in the sun. The beaches sands turned black as blood flowed out of the new open wounds in the side of the angel. The smell of rot entered Shinji's nose and he start gagging slightly.  
大块的肉开始脱落，瞬间变黑，开始破碎并分解在沙滩上。腐臭的黑血从残留的半个器官中流出，在阳光下腐烂。沙滩的沙子因血液从天使侧面的新伤口流出而变黑。腐烂的气味钻入真嗣的鼻孔，他开始微微作呕。

"Uh, smells terrible," said a raspy Asuka who had her nostrils pierced together by her thumb and index finger.  
“呃，臭死了。”明日香沙哑地说道，她的拇指和食指穿过鼻孔紧紧捏在一起。

'Thats an understatement,' thought Shinji.  
“这还只是轻描淡写。”真嗣心想。

Then something that truly sent Shinji and Asuka into fits of nauseous upheaval happened. Large strands of nerves and tendons shot out from both of the angels sides and wrapped around each other. With feeling rekindled in the body the separate bodies were able to stand up and it seemed that the connected flesh was starting to reel in the separate pieces.  
随后，真正让真嗣和明日香感到极度恶心的事情发生了。从两个使徒的两侧射出大量神经和肌腱，相互缠绕。随着身体感觉的恢复，分离的身体能够站立起来，似乎连接的肉体开始将分离的部分拉回。

"Thats disgusting," muttered Asuka.  
“真恶心。”明日香嘀咕道。

Shinji agreed with her nonchalantly.  
真嗣不以为意地同意了她的看法。

As the two bodies became one again the flesh bubbled over the recently closed wound and turned smooth as though it had never separated.  
随着两具身体再次合二为一，新近闭合的伤口处的肉体冒起了泡，变得光滑如初，仿佛从未分离过。

Without any change in demeanor the angel quickly regained its pace and charged at Unit 01. Without thinking, Shinji created a quick AT-field that was easily smashed as the angels fist tore through it.  
天使的神情未变，迅速恢复了速度，向初号机冲来。下意识地，真嗣迅速展开了 AT 力场，却被天使的拳头轻易击穿。

"Shit!" "该死！"

Doing a flip backwards Shinji landed next to Asuka in Unit 02.  
真嗣一个后空翻，落在了二号机旁的地上。

"We got it to join, but now what?"  
“我们让它加入了，但接下来怎么办？”

"I thought you had a plan after the last one!"  
"我以为上次之后你会有个计划！"

Shinji didn't want to remind Asuka that this wasn't a time to fight and remained silent.  
真嗣不想提醒明日香这不是争斗的时候，于是保持沉默。

"Well if your not going to do anything, I'll go first."  
"好吧，如果你什么都不打算做，那我就先上了。"

Before Shinji could argue that it was better to work together, Unit 02 kicked off against the sand and put on a burst of speed towards the angel. Quickly ducking the blow that was intended for its face, the angel delivered a brutal uppercut to Unit 02's jaw.  
在真嗣能辩驳说合作更好之前，二号机蹬开沙子，加速冲向使徒。迅速低头躲过本应击中其面部的攻击，使徒对二号机的下巴施以一记残酷的上勾拳。

Shinji winced slightly as he heard Asuka groan in pain, but really, it was her fault for being so rash.  
听到明日香痛苦的呻吟，真嗣微微皱眉，但说真的，她这么鲁莽是自找的。

"If you're done fooling around, I've got another idea."  
“如果你闹够了，我还有另一个主意。”

"Well aren't you being useful for once."  
"哎呀，你这次倒是派上用场了。"

Shinji ignored her spiteful retort and said, "Its quite simple since we out number him now."  
真嗣无视她的尖刻反驳，说道：“这很简单，因为我们现在人数上占优势。”

"...Fine...I'm listening."  
"……好吧……我在听。"

After a hasty reply on what he intended her to do she simply sighed and said, "Fine I'll be the bait."  
在匆忙回复了他打算让她做什么之后，她只是叹了口气说：“好吧，我来当诱饵。”

"No...I'll do it!" “不……我来！”

It took less than a second for Asuka to reply, "Eh?"  
不到一秒钟，明日香就回应道：“诶？”

"It'd be better if I do it."  
"还是我来比较好。"

"Hmmm? Well aren't you acting gallantly all the sudden."  
"嗯？怎么突然这么英勇了。"

"...I'd just prefer it if I did."  
"...我只是更希望自己来做。"

"Fine just move! We don't have much time!" Screamed Asuka as she watched time ticking away for their remaining energy.  
“快点动起来！我们没多少时间了！”明日香尖叫着，眼看着剩余能量一点点流逝。

Shinji had started moving before she finished her sentence.  
真嗣在她话音未落时就已经开始行动了。

Appearing in front of the angel, he swung out but was quickly met with a strong AT-field. Shinji had no time to worry about breaking it and quickly spun around the side of the angel and attempted to elbow it in the side, but was met with another strong AT-field. This time spinning around towards it back, he reached in the shoulder holster on Unit 01 and swiftly wiped out the progressive knife. Stabbing in a backwards motion it was met with thin air as the angel had done a back flip and was not hovering above Unit 01.  
他出现在使徒面前，挥拳出击，却立刻遭遇了强大的 AT 力场。真嗣无暇顾及如何打破它，迅速绕到使徒侧面，试图用肘击其侧身，却又被另一道强大的 AT 力场挡住。这次他转向使徒背后，伸手从初号机的肩部枪套中迅速抽出高频振动刀。反手一刺，却扑了个空，原来使徒已经后空翻，悬浮在初号机上方。

Shinji quickly rolled out of the way as an AT-field attempted to enclose him and slowly crush him to death. Standing back up he was greeted by the angel as it dove down towards the ground with its legs outstretched, intending to kick Unit 01 in the chest. Shinji quickly ducked underneath as the kick barely missed the side of Unit 01's head. Simultaneously he swung in an arc above his head with the progressive knife, slicing into the angels thigh as it passed over him.  
真嗣迅速滚向一旁，躲避着试图包围并慢慢将他压碎的 AT 力场。站起身来，他迎面遭遇了天使，它双腿伸直俯冲向地面，意图用脚踢击初号机的胸膛。真嗣迅速低头躲闪，这一脚险些擦过初号机的头部侧面。同时，他挥动高振动粒子刀在头顶上方划出一道弧线，刀刃切入天使的大腿，在其掠过他时造成了伤害。

Doing several cart wheels backwards he noticed that he was at the edge of the beach were it connected with the ocean.  
他连续后空翻了几下，注意到自己已经到了沙滩与海洋的交界处。

Breathing in a weary sort of way he wiped some sweat off his brow and he charged in again. As he neared the angel he swung the progressive knife wildly towards where he suspected the core was. Normally the angel would have generated an AT-field this time to prevent another wound, though Asuka hadn't permitted that.  
他以一种疲惫的方式喘息着，擦去额头的汗水，再次发起冲锋。接近天使时，他疯狂地挥舞高振动粒子刀，朝他猜测的核心位置砍去。通常情况下，天使此时会生成 AT 力场来防止再次受伤，但明日香并未允许这种情况发生。

While Shinji had been occupying the angel, Asuka had been patiently waiting for an opening to attack in a swift fashion. Shinji had wanted her to do this part largely because she had more experience with actual combat then he did. She had been in more combat situations and training and was able to read a situation like this better then him.  
当真嗣牵制住使徒时，明日香耐心地等待着攻击的时机，准备以迅雷不及掩耳之势出击。真嗣希望她来完成这一部分，主要是因为她在实战方面的经验比他丰富。她经历过更多的战斗和训练，能够比他更好地判断这样的局势。

So before the angel was able to generate an AT-field, Asuka appeared from above and drove her own progressive knife directly into the skull of the angel, preventing any nerves from communicating for a brief moment. It was in that moment that Shinji dug his progressive knife into the stomach of the angel. Grabbing the handle with both hands, Unit 01 dug the knife in further and with a quick thrust, slashed upwards, cutting the abdominal cavity in two in the process.  
所以在使徒能够生成 AT 力场之前，明日香从上方现身，将她的高频振动刀直接刺入使徒的头颅，阻止了神经信号的传递片刻。就在这一瞬间，真嗣将他的高频振动刀插入了使徒的腹部。双手紧握刀柄，初号机将刀深入，随即迅速上挑，将腹腔一分为二。

Blood and organs cascaded out and onto the ground as the angel started writhing around, shaking Asuka off as it started unleashing its fury.  
血液和内脏如瀑布般倾泻而出，使徒开始剧烈扭动，将明日香甩开，并发泄着它的狂怒。

Before it was able to start regenerate though Shinji noticed something that had fallen out of the abdominal cavity and without a second though pierced it with his progressive knife.  
然而，在它开始再生之前，真嗣注意到有什么东西从腹部腔体中掉了出来，他毫不犹豫地用他的高频刀刺穿了它。

What was left of the angel exploded suddenly in a viscous red haze that splattered blood in a one kilometer radius. Shinji looked at what was left of the carcass of the angel was throughly glad that he didn't have to take any part in the cleanup.  
天使残余的部分突然爆炸，形成了一片粘稠的红色雾霾，血迹溅射到了一公里的范围内。真嗣看着天使残骸的遗留物，庆幸自己不必参与清理工作。

Breathing out a sigh of relief he glanced over at Asuka and said, "Nice job."  
他松了一口气，瞥向明日香，说道：“干得漂亮。”

"What would you expect from the best."  
"你还能期待最好的什么呢。"

'Maybe a little quicker next time,' thought Shinji.  
'也许下次能再快一点，'真嗣心想。

Suddenly Misato's face appeared on the monitor at his side with a beaming smile on her face.  
突然，美里带着灿烂的笑容出现在他旁边的显示器上。

"Great job you two, really great. I suppose that the training paid off."  
"你们俩干得真棒，确实很棒。我想那次训练还是值得的。"

"Please don't ever mention that training again for as long as I live," shuddered Asuka.  
"求你这辈子都别再提那次训练了，"明日香颤抖着说。

Shinji just laugh. In the end it hadn't been all that bad.  
真嗣只是笑了笑。毕竟，最后也没那么糟糕。

"Oh, I know. As to celebrate I'll take you two out to eat. And to be fair I'll ask Rei to come along."  
"哦，我知道了。为了庆祝，我带你们俩出去吃饭。为了公平起见，我会叫丽一起来的。"

Asuka's mood suddenly turned sour. "Food does sound good, but why does the first child have to tag along?"  
明日香的心情突然变差了。“吃饭听起来不错，但为什么第一适格者非得跟着来？”

"Why couldn't she," mumbled Shinji?  
“她为什么不能来，”真嗣小声嘀咕道？

Asuka's face suddenly appeared on the monitor directly in front of him and she looked like she was about to exploded.  
明日香的脸突然出现在他正前方的屏幕上，看起来她快要爆炸了。

"PERVERTED BAKA! YOU JUST WANT TO HEAR HER PRAISE YOU!"  
"变态笨蛋！你只是想听她夸你吧！"

"Ah...is Asuka a little jealous," smirked Misato.  
"啊...明日香是不是有点吃醋了，"美里微微一笑。

"WHAAAAAAAAAAT!" "哇啊啊啊啊啊！"

"Calm down Asuka. I ment it as a joke."  
"冷静点，明日香。我只是在开玩笑。"

"Tch!" "切！"

"Well, anyway...get back here and let the hazard team start cleanup. It could take a while..."  
"总之...回来吧，让危险应对小组开始清理。这可能需要一段时间..."

"Hai," said both Shinji and Asuka simultaneously.  
"是," 真嗣和明日香同时说道。

---

In the end Misato had taken them all out for ramen. Asuka had been outraged that her effort was equal to about one bowl of ramen. Not to mention that Rei had joined them which only improved her mood. And now Shinji had to deal with that mood as they returned home.  
最终，美里带他们所有人去吃了拉面。明日香对于她的努力只值一碗拉面感到愤怒。更不用说丽也加入了他们，这让她的心情更加糟糕。现在，真嗣不得不在他们回家时应对她的情绪。

Asuka swung the door open hard and it banged off the wall. There had already been several large dents accumulated since she moved in and this only added to them.  
明日香用力推开门，门重重地撞在墙上。自从她搬进来后，门上已经积累了好几个大凹痕，这次又添了一笔。

"Do you have to do that every time you get in a bad mood?"  
“每次心情不好都要这样吗？”

Asuka slowly turned her head towards Shinji who was frowning at the door and said in a quiet voice, "What was that?"  
明日香缓缓转头看向皱着眉头的真嗣，轻声问道：“你说什么？”

"...Never mind. It doesn't really matter."  
"...没关系。其实也没那么重要。"

"Good." "很好。"

Trudging over to the living room she quickly seated herself on the sofa and flipped the T.V. Shinji was about to do likewise though when she hollered at him.  
她拖着沉重的步伐走到客厅，迅速坐在沙发上，打开了电视。真嗣正要照做，却被她大声叫住了。

"Hey, get me a bag of chips and a soda."  
"嘿，给我拿包薯片和一瓶汽水。"

"Why should I?" "凭什么我得去？"

"Because I said so. Now move it!"  
"因为我说的。快去！"

Shinji grumbled and in the end gave in to her wishes. It seemed that nothing had changed.  
真嗣嘟囔着，最终还是顺从了她的意愿。似乎一切都没有改变。

After rummaging around in the fridge and cupboard for the items she requested he walked back in the living room and deposited the chips on her chest put the cold drink next to her face. She seemed to jump slightly at the cold that was touching her face and glared at him for his annoying action. Swiping the bag of chips off her chest she popped them open and starting eating them by the handful.  
在冰箱和橱柜里翻找了一番，找到了她要的东西后，他走回客厅，把薯片放在她胸口，将冷饮贴在她脸旁。她似乎被脸上的冰冷吓了一跳，瞪了他一眼，怪他这烦人的举动。她一把抓过胸口的薯片袋，打开后大口大口地吃了起来。

Shinji sighed and thought, 'Back to the usual Asuka.'  
真嗣叹了口气，心想：'又是平常的明日香。'

Turning around he was about to got crash in his room when he heard her mumble through a mouthful of chips.  
他转过身，正要冲进自己的房间，却听到她嘴里塞满薯片含糊地咕哝着。

"Ba...Shinji?" “八...真嗣？”

"Huh?" “啊？”

Turning around, Shinji just saw her take a large gulp and downed half the soda. Setting it down she wiped her hands on the sofa getting rid of the crumbs from the chips.  
转过身，真嗣只看到她猛地喝了一大口，半瓶汽水就下肚了。放下瓶子，她用手在沙发上抹了抹，去掉薯片留下的碎屑。

"You...I mean...not that it means much but...thanks, for your help."  
“你……我是说……虽然这不算什么大事，但是……谢谢你的帮助。”

Shinji scratched the back of his head confusedly wondering what had happened with this sudden mood change.  
真嗣困惑地挠了挠后脑勺，不明白这突如其来的情绪变化是怎么回事。

"Erm, well, thanks." "呃，嗯，谢谢。"

Asuka sat up then and frowned at Shinji before saying. "By the way...why were you looking so keenly at the stupid first child while at the ramen shop?"  
明日香坐起身来，皱着眉头看向真嗣，然后问道：“顺便问一下……为什么你在拉面店里那么专注地盯着那个愚蠢的第一适格者？”

"Huh? Was I?" "啊？我有吗？"

Asuka's eyes seemed to flash crimson like a demons. "Your perverted eyes were all over her."  
明日香的眼中仿佛闪烁着恶魔般的猩红。“你那猥琐的目光一直在她身上游走。”

"I really have no idea what your talking about."  
“我真不知道你在说什么。”

"Go ahead and feign stupidity. Pervert!"  
“继续装傻吧。变态！”

Shinji was at a loss of how the conversation had gone from somewhat friendly, to this.  
真嗣完全不知道这场对话是如何从还算友好的氛围变成这样的。

"Well, if thats what you think, I guess it doesn't really matter. I know I wasn't doing that."  
“好吧，如果你这么认为，我想确实无关紧要。我知道我不是那样做的。”

"Doesn't real-Were you born stupid?"  
“难道不是真的——你天生就这么蠢吗？”

Shinji was about to retort back at her that she was completely overreacting and that he had never even thought of looking at Rei when the door bell rung.  
真嗣正要反驳她，说她完全反应过度，他从未想过要去看绫波，这时门铃响了。

Asuka and Shinji both turned their heads towards the sound.  
明日香和真嗣都转向声音的方向。

"Did you lock the door after you walked in," asked Asuka?  
“你进来后锁门了吗？”明日香问道。

"No...I don't think so." "不...我觉得不是。"

"Can't understand why Misato would ring the door bell then."  
"真搞不懂美里为什么会按门铃。"

Shinji and Asuka looked at each other, hoping that the other would get up and find out. Then-  
真嗣和明日香互相对视，希望对方能起身去看看。然后——

"Fine I'll check." "好吧，我去看看。"

"Good." "很好。"

Shrugging as though he didn't care either way Shinji slowly got up, walked out of the living room, and into the hallway. After stopping in front of the door he suddenly wished they had one of those peep holes so he could find out who it was without opening it. Though he supposed he didn't have much choice. Maybe Misato had gotten too drunk and couldn't remember how to open doors.  
仿佛无所谓一般耸了耸肩，真嗣缓缓起身，走出客厅，进入走廊。在门前停下时，他突然希望他们有个猫眼，这样他就能在不打开门的情况下知道来者是谁。不过他想自己也没太多选择。或许是美里喝得太醉，连开门都不会了。

Swinging it open he mumbled without looking first.  
他没先看一眼就推开门，嘴里咕哝着。

"Yes?" "是的？"

What answered him was not something that he had been expecting. The voice was that of somebody in their late thirties or early forties. Certainly somebody Shinji didn't know. What's more the voice was that of a man.  
回应他的并非他所预料之物。那声音属于一个三十多岁或四十出头的人，显然是真嗣不认识的人。更重要的是，那是一个男人的声音。

"Is this the home of Misato Katsuragi?"  
“这里是葛城美里小姐的家吗？”

"Uh-huh." Shinji didn't know what to do in situations like this. Was this some guy that Misato had dated once?  
"嗯哼。" 真嗣在这种情境下不知该如何是好。这难道是美里曾经交往过的某个人吗？

"I see," he replied in a strong male voice. 'Almost sounds like somebody that works in real estate,' Shinji thought.  
"我明白了，"他用浑厚的男声回答。'听起来像是做房地产的，' 真嗣暗想。

"Then is there somebody named Asuka Langely Soryu living here?"  
"那么，这里是否住着一位名叫惣流·明日香·兰格雷的小姐？"

Shinji had to do a double take. How the heck did this guy know Asuka?  
真嗣不得不再次确认。这家伙到底是怎么认识明日香的？

Replying in an offhanded way he said, "Erm, well, yeah."  
他随口答道：“呃，嗯，是的。”

"Could you tell her that I'd like to talk to her."  
“你能告诉她我想和她谈谈吗？”

Shinji hesitated slightly and glanced at the guy. Now that he had gotten a good look at him he noticed that he had a well mannered face and seemed to be dressed in a pair of slacks and a Hawaiian button up tee-shirt. He seemed to be good natured enough and so Shinji mumbled, "Yeah, hang on, I'll call her."  
真嗣稍微犹豫了一下，瞥了那人一眼。现在仔细一看，他注意到那人有一张彬彬有礼的脸，穿着一条休闲裤和一件夏威夷风格的扣领 T 恤。他看起来性情温和，于是真嗣咕哝道：“嗯，等一下，我叫她。”

Looking over his shoulder he hollered just like she had done earlier.  
他回头望去，就像她之前那样大声喊道。

"Oi, Asuka!" “喂，明日香！”

"What, damn it!" "什么，该死！"

"Somebody at the door wants to talk to you."  
"门口有人想跟你谈谈。"

"Huh? To me?" "啊？找我？"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"Heh, most be another idiot wanting to invite me to their college. I can't count the idiots I've yelled at since I got here."  
"哼，多半又是哪个白痴想邀请我去他们大学。自从来到这里，我已经不知道对多少白痴吼过了。"

"I don't think its exactly like that," said Shinji as he heard Asuka sliding off the couch.  
""我觉得情况未必如此，"" 真嗣说道，他听到明日香从沙发上滑下来的声音。

"Whatever. I'll find out for myself."  
"管他呢。我自己会弄清楚的。"

Shinji would never forget the look on Asuka's grimacing face as she poked it out of the living room to get a glimpse of who the person was. Shinji did not believe that it was a face that Asuka was even capable of making. Now though her expression would forever be etched in his mind as her grimacing face slowly turned from one of surprise, to absolute loathing, then, to scared and afraid. It was this last expression that Shinji had never expected to see on her face. It was unheard of for Asuka to become afraid.  
真嗣永远不会忘记明日香那扭曲的面孔，当她从客厅探出头来，试图一窥来者是谁时的表情。真嗣不相信明日香能做出那样的表情。但现在，她的表情将永远烙印在他的记忆中，那扭曲的面孔从惊讶逐渐转变为绝对的厌恶，然后，变得恐惧和害怕。正是这最后的表情，真嗣从未预料到会在她脸上看到。明日香变得害怕，这是前所未闻的。

Slowly, Shinji saw her open and close her mouth pitifully and saw that she seemed to shrink from where she stood. Her hands slowly formed at her chest and slowly wrapped themselves around her body as though she was trying to protect herself from the stranger. Her legs became wobbly and Shinji firmly believed that she would have collapsed if he hadn't quickly rushed over to support her.  
慢慢地，真嗣看到她可怜地张合着嘴巴，似乎从站立的地方缩了回去。她的双手缓缓地在胸前合拢，慢慢环绕着自己的身体，仿佛试图从陌生人那里保护自己。她的双腿变得摇摇晃晃，真嗣坚信，如果不是他迅速冲过去扶住她，她早就倒下了。

Holding a steady hand on her shoulder he took a good look at her face and saw that tears had formed at the corners of her eyes and were threatening to spill forth. Shinji opened his mouth slightly but quickly closed it. Slowly, his gaze shifted towards the stranger who had not budged since he had rang the door bell.  
他稳稳地把手搭在她的肩上，仔细端详着她的脸，发现眼角已经积满了泪水，眼看就要夺眶而出。真嗣微微张开嘴，却又迅速闭上了。慢慢地，他的目光转向了那位自按响门铃后就一直未曾动弹的陌生人。

"I'm back, Asuka..." “我回来了，明日香……”

Shinji looked quickly back at Asuka who's tears had finally spilled forth, reflecting sealed memories and the fear that she had lived with to this day.  
真嗣迅速回头看向明日香，她的泪水终于滑落，映照出封存的记忆和她至今所承受的恐惧。

As Shinji heard the single word she uttered, he felt a strong hatred that he had never felt in his life. Stronger than his hatred for his own father. A hatred that could only be directed at one person.  
当真嗣听到她吐出的那个字时，他感受到了一种前所未有的强烈憎恨。比他对亲生父亲的恨意还要强烈。这种恨意只能指向一个人。

"Fa-Father?"  “父、父亲？”

**Got this done a lot sooner than I expected. As usual I end up changing stuff here and there to change the story to something more...original I guess is the correct word. With regards to the anatomy of the angel...its something that I was always curious about. Also I was curious about how they generated an AT-field. So with regards to that I decided to throw in the fact that they function just like a human, in that they have a brain and send signals throughout the body. Which explains why when Asuka stabbed directly into the brain of the angel it was briefly...unconscious I suppose is what you could call it.  
完成得比预期早得多。一如既往，我最终还是在这里那里改动了一些东西，把故事改得更...原创一些，我想这个词是恰当的。关于使徒的解剖结构...我一直很好奇。还有它们是如何产生 AT 力场的。因此，关于这一点，我决定加入它们像人类一样运作的事实，即它们有大脑并通过身体发送信号。这也解释了为什么当明日香直接刺入使徒的大脑时，它会短暂地...失去意识，我想你可以这么称呼它。**

**On another note how did you like the cliffhanger? Was it expected? I had planned on including Asuka's father to show up later and in a different scenario...but I decided to do something different for that specific scenario. Anyways this is long winded and what not so I'm gonna stop now.  
换个话题，你觉得那个悬念怎么样？是意料之中的吗？我原本计划让明日香的爸爸在后面某个不同的情节中出现...但我决定为那个特定情节做些不同的安排。总之，这些话有点冗长，所以我现在就打住。**

### Chapter 9: Relapse
第九章：复发  

**As you can tell this is a much longer chapter than I've ever done before. Large reason for this is because I'm going back to college in three days so I won't have as much time to work on this as I'd like. So hopefully this will make due for now. I had thought about splitting it up also, but in the end decided to go with what you see here.  
如你所见，这一章比以往任何一章都要长。主要原因是三天后我就要回大学了，所以没有那么多时间来写这个故事。希望这一章能暂时弥补一下。我也曾考虑过把它分成几部分，但最终还是决定按照现在的样子呈现。**

"Fa-Father?" “父、父亲？”

Shinji felt Asuka shiver uncontrollably at her own words, as though she had just gotten out of a walk in freezer. With his gaze still fixed on Asuka he watched silently as the tears continued to fall off her chin while a boiling hatred was erupting inside of him. If he were to take one step forward he knew he wouldn't be able to stop himself and probably end of killing the man. He would have deserved it too. Instead though-  
真嗣感觉到明日香的话让她自己不由自主地颤抖，仿佛刚从冷藏室走出来一样。他的目光依旧紧盯着明日香，默默地看着泪水继续从她的下巴滴落，而他的内心却涌动着沸腾的仇恨。如果他向前迈出一步，他知道自己将无法控制自己，很可能会杀了那个人。他也确实该死。然而——

"Asuka...is it really you? You look just like your mother," whispered her father.  
“明日香...真的是你吗？你看起来和你母亲一模一样，”她的父亲低声说道。

Shinji's eyes flew towards him. How dare that bastard even acknowledge that he recognized her this many years later! How dare that asshole mention the similarities between her and her mother! How dare that whore mongering piece of shit even be breathing the same air as Asuka!  
真嗣的目光猛地转向他。那个混蛋怎么敢这么多年后还敢承认他认出了她！那个混蛋怎么敢提及她和母亲的相似之处！那个嫖娼的垃圾怎么敢和明日香呼吸同样的空气！

Asuka's father seemed to notice that he was giving him a death glare that could melt the armor right off of Eva and seemed to hesitate before stammering.  
明日香的父亲似乎注意到了他投来的足以融化 EVA 装甲的死亡凝视，似乎犹豫了一下，然后结结巴巴地说道。

"A-A-Asuka...is that you? It is isn't it? Please...I-I wanted to see you. I wanted to see my only daughter."  
“A-A-Asuka...是你吗？真的是你吧？求求你...我-我想见你。我想见我唯一的女儿。”

It was at that moment that Shinji exploded, letting forth the pent up anger. He wanted to talk with the daughter that he had tossed aside? He wanted to act like everything had never happened and they could start over entirely from scratch? Shinji couldn't let that happen even if he was reborn as a dog. He'd tear this fucker's leg off before letting him get close to Asuka.  
就在那一刻，真嗣爆发了，释放出积压已久的愤怒。他想和被他抛弃的女儿谈谈？他想装作一切都没发生过，从头开始？真嗣就算重生为狗，也不会让这家伙靠近明日香。他宁愿撕掉这混蛋的腿，也不让他接近明日香。

Just as her father took a hesitant step forward, Shinji took an assertive step forward and placed himself directly in front of Asuka, blocking his view. He wanted to make his action extremely clear and without a doubt in the man's mind standing in front of him.  
就在她父亲犹豫着迈出一步时，真嗣果断地向前一步，直接站在明日香前面，挡住了他的视线。他想让他的行动非常明确，让站在他面前的男人毫无疑问。

"Asuka does not want to talk to you," he said in as calm a voice he could muster. In truth he felt like ripping the guys throat out.  
"明日香不想和你说话，"他用尽可能平静的声音说道。实际上，他感觉自己想撕裂那家伙的喉咙。

The air was so tense that you would have had to cut it with a chainsaw. While stammering over his words, Asuka's father said, "But...I-I I thought you just said...that it'd...b-be okay if we...ta-talked?"  
空气紧张得仿佛要用电锯才能切开。明日香的父亲结结巴巴地说："但...我...我以为你刚才说...说我们...聊...聊一聊也没关系？"

"That was before I found out who you were," Shinji whispered in that same calm voice that radiated pure loathing.  
"那是在我发现你是谁之前，"真嗣用同样平静却充满纯粹厌恶的声音低语道。

Asuka's father was obviously not used to talking with a teenager like this and tried to retort angrily, "This doesn't concern you. So if you could please move out of the way I'd like to speak with my daug-"  
明日香的父亲显然不习惯这样和一个十几岁的孩子交谈，试图愤怒地反驳，“这与你无关。所以如果你能请让开，我想和我女儿谈谈——”

Shinji cut across him and with each word his voice grew louder, "What right do you have to speak to a daughter that you threw away! What right do you have to call her out when she's finally found some place that cares for her! YOU DON'T DESERVE TO TALK TO HER YOU PIECE OF SHIT!"  
真嗣打断了他，随着每个字音的升高，他的声音越来越大，“你有什么资格对一个你抛弃的女儿说话！她终于找到了一个关心她的地方，你有什么权利叫她出来！你不配和她说话，你这个混蛋！”

At Shinji's hate filled words, her father took a few hasty steps back as though giving himself a decent head start if Shinji decided to kill him.  
在真嗣充满仇恨的话语下，她的父亲急忙后退了几步，仿佛给自己留出了足够的距离，以防真嗣决定杀了他。

"Please," he started pleading. "I know I screwed up, and I know that I don't deserve to be forgiven. But please...she's my only daughter, and I still love her."  
"求你了，"他开始恳求道。"我知道我搞砸了，我也知道我不配被原谅。但是请……她是我唯一的女儿，我依然爱她。"

"LOVE HER! WHEN THE FUCK DID YOU EVER SHOW THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF LOVING HER!"  
"爱她！你他妈什么时候表现出过一丝爱她的迹象！"

"I'll get down on my hands and knees and beg for mercy if I have to. Just please..."  
"我愿意跪下双手合十乞求宽恕，只要请……"

Shinji glared hatefully at the man bowing in front of him. His entirely body twitched and it was taking an enormous amount of willpower to not break the guys skull open.  
真嗣憎恨地瞪着面前鞠躬的男人。他全身都在抽搐，需要极大的意志力才能克制住不把那家伙的头骨敲碎。

Grimacing back at him he took several slow steps towards the door before looking down at the pitiful human in front of him.  
他皱着眉头回瞪，慢慢地向门口走了几步，然后低头看着眼前可怜的人类。

"You lost the right to talk to her long ago. Don't come crawling back to her five years later as though you can make amends for everything that happened."  
“你早就失去了和她说话的权利。别五年后才爬回来，好像你能弥补发生的一切似的。”

Before her father was able to start begging again Shinji shut the door with a loud snap and locked the door knob along with the dead bolt. Misato be damned right now. If she forgot to bring her key to unlock the dead bolt then that was her problem.  
在她父亲再次开始乞求之前，真嗣砰的一声用力关上门，并锁上了门把手和防盗锁。现在就让美里见鬼去吧。如果她忘了带钥匙来开防盗锁，那就是她的问题了。

Shinji stood in front of the door for a few seconds. If he rang the door bell again then Shinji would have thrown open the door and really broken his skull. Though he was saved the opportunity to be arrested as he heard shuffling footsteps walking away from the door.  
真嗣站在门前几秒钟。如果他再次按响门铃，真嗣可能会猛地打开门，真的打破他的头骨。不过，他幸免于被逮捕的机会，因为他听到拖着脚步的声音从门口走开。

All the tension seemed to evaporate out of him. Even though he had put up a brave front he was honestly scared. Asuka's depiction of her father made him out to be a heartless man that wouldn't hesitate to violence. Before, he didn't know what to expect if he ever met the man. The contrast from his mind to reality was a long ways off. He seemed like a complete push over. Maybe it was the alcohol that made him particularly violent.  
所有的紧张情绪似乎都从他身上消失了。尽管他表面上装得很勇敢，但实际上他真的很害怕。明日香对她父亲的描述让他觉得那是一个冷酷无情、毫不犹豫使用暴力的人。以前，他不知道如果见到这个人会有什么期待。从他的想象到现实之间的差距很大。他看起来完全是个软弱的人。也许是因为酒精让他变得特别暴力。

Finally turning around he felt his face sag as he saw that Asuka hadn't moved from where he had left her and that tears were still pouring from her eyes. It seemed that they were built up over the course of many years.  
终于转过身来，他看到明日香仍站在他离开她的地方，泪水依旧从她的眼中涌出，他的脸不禁垮了下来。这些泪水似乎积攒了许多年。

Without hesitating he walked slowly towards, and, moments later, stood in front of Asuka. Words weren't needed to express each other, though Shinji couldn't possibly grasp what torment Asuka was currently going through. He wanted to let her know that he was there for her and opened his mouth to mention that.  
他毫不犹豫地慢慢走向她，片刻后站在明日香面前。无需言语，尽管真嗣无法理解明日香此刻所承受的痛苦，但他想让她知道他在她身边，于是张开嘴想要表达这一点。

Before his mouth got half open though she leaned forward and almost made him topple backwards as her entire body weight came crashing onto him. Instinctively, Shinji braced himself and brought his arms around her back so that she wouldn't slide off to the side. So, she was snugly being held against his chest. Shinji could feel the gallons of water slowly be soaked into his already sweating dripping shirt.  
然而，在他还没完全张开嘴之前，她向前一倾，几乎让他向后倒去，她的整个体重猛地压在他身上。本能地，真嗣稳住自己，双臂环抱住她的背，以免她滑向一旁。就这样，她紧紧地贴在他的胸前。真嗣能感觉到大量的泪水慢慢浸透了他早已汗湿的衬衫。

Asuka's legs finally gave in and the need to be standing became pointless. As her legs collapsed, so did Shinji's along with her as he matched his fall with hers. So, kneeling in the middle of the hallway, Shinji let Asuka shed her worries onto his chest. At first it had been solely him that had his arms around her waist. Though after a particularly loud wail, Shinji felt himself being pushing backwards onto the hard wooden floor while her arms wrapped around his waist.  
明日香的腿终于支撑不住，站立变得毫无意义。随着她的双腿瘫软，真嗣也跟着她一起倒下，他的跌落与她同步。于是，跪在走廊中央，真嗣让明日香将她的忧虑倾泻在他的胸膛上。起初，只有他双臂环抱着她的腰。但经过一阵特别响亮的哀嚎后，真嗣感到自己被向后推倒在坚硬的木地板上，而她的双臂则紧紧环绕在他的腰间。

'Huh?' '啊？'

Shinji didn't fully comprehend until long after his back had hit the floor; and Asuka's face was nestled against Shinji's collarbone, what was going on. It certainly was the closest they had come with an intimate moment. Asuka's body was perfectly aligned with Shinji's body to the point where he couldn't tell the difference between their two heartbeats. After a while, Shinji felt that a small pool was starting to build up in the crook of his collarbone and knew that this wasn't the time to be sharing something like this.  
真嗣直到背部重重地撞到地板，明日香的脸埋在他的锁骨间，才完全明白发生了什么。这无疑是他们迄今为止最亲密的时刻。明日香的身体与真嗣的身体完美契合，以至于他几乎分不清两人的心跳。过了一会儿，真嗣感觉到锁骨的凹陷处开始积聚泪水，他知道现在不是分享这种情感的时候。

Relinquishing his grip around Asuka's waist he brought his hands to her shoulder and tried to convince her to stand up, though she didn't seem to want to comply. While Shinji wasn't really disgusted by their position, he didn't want things to get carried away. If he took advantage of her, he wouldn't be able to forgive himself. If they were to develop a more romantic relationship he didn't want it built upon something so heart wrenching as this. So with a little more coaxing he managed to get Asuka to sit up, though in some aspects it was worse as she was now sitting in his lap. He was surprised at how small she seemed then.  
他松开了环绕在明日香腰间的手，转而扶住她的肩膀，试图说服她站起来，尽管她似乎并不愿意配合。虽然真嗣并没有真的对他们的姿势感到厌恶，但他不希望事情失控。如果他趁机占她便宜，他将无法原谅自己。如果他们要发展一段更浪漫的关系，他不希望它建立在如此令人心碎的基础上。因此，经过一番劝说，他终于让明日香坐了起来，尽管在某些方面这更糟糕，因为她现在正坐在他的腿上。他惊讶于她那时显得多么娇小。

"Asuka...you okay?" Of course she wasn't, but he found he had to start somewhere.  
“明日香……你还好吗？”当然她并不好，但他发现自己总得从某个地方开始。

Asuka however didn't seem like she was in the mood for talking quite yet and continued sitting in Shinji's lap with a dejected look on her face.  
然而，明日香似乎还没有心情说话，她继续坐在真嗣的腿上，脸上带着沮丧的表情。

After another minute of silence between the two, Shinji let out a weary sigh. It wasn't that he was annoyed with her switch to a helpless girl who couldn't do anything. He just didn't think that the helplessness suited her. She should be pacing around the room insulting her father and calming him as many names as she could muster. He would have gladly joined in.  
又是一分钟的沉默后，真嗣发出了一声疲惫的叹息。并非他对她突然变成一个无助的女孩感到恼火，只是他认为这种无助并不适合她。她本该在房间里踱步，用尽各种词汇辱骂她的父亲，同时安抚他。他倒是很乐意加入。

After the audible sigh Shinji decided to take things into his own hands. Sliding out carefully from under her, he held onto her arms so that she wouldn't topple backwards. After pulling the last of his left leg out from her, he propped his hands behind his back and glanced at her face. She had now pulled her knees up as close as they would go to her body and had buried her head between them.  
听到真嗣的叹息声后，他决定自己采取行动。小心翼翼地从她身下滑出，他抓住她的手臂以防她向后倒下。最后从她身下抽出左腿后，他双手撑在背后，瞥了一眼她的脸。她现在将膝盖紧紧地贴向身体，并将头埋在双膝之间。

After another pause she finally spoke. "Shin-ji...?"  
又是一阵停顿后，她终于开口了。"真嗣...？"

"...Hrm?" "...嗯？"

"Ari-gato..." "阿里嘎多..."

"...Don't worry about it."  
"...别担心。"

Shinji watched as Asuka finally looked up at him. Her tears appeared to have stopped but her eyes were extremely blood shot.  
真嗣看着明日香终于抬头望向他。她的泪水似乎已经止住，但双眼布满血丝。

"Think you can stand?" “觉得能站起来吗？”

Rubbing her eyes with the backs of her hands she mumbled, "Yeah...I think so."  
她用双手背揉了揉眼睛，含糊地咕哝道，“嗯……我想可以。”

Placing both hands on the ground she slowly pushed herself up and on to wobbly feet.  
她双手撑地，缓缓将自己推起，站到了摇摇晃晃的双脚上。

"See I'm fine," she said in an attempt to pass off everything that had happened. Though next second Shinji had to rush forward as she took a hasty step forward and ended up losing her balance.  
“看，我没事，”她试图轻描淡写地掩饰刚刚发生的一切。然而下一秒，真嗣不得不冲上前去，因为她急匆匆地迈出一步，结果失去了平衡。

With her head resting on Shinji's chest again she opened her mouth and mumbled something that Shinji had never expected.  
她的头再次靠在真嗣的胸前，张开嘴，含糊地说了些什么，这是真嗣从未预料到的。

"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for this. It's because I'm so wea-"  
"对不起。我真的很抱歉。这都是因为我太软弱了——"

"Don't say it!" "别这么说！"

Shinji fiercely wrapped his arms around her waist and drew her in closer.  
真嗣紧紧地用双臂环住她的腰，将她拉得更近。

"...Don't say that...never. You're the strongest person I know."  
"...别这么说...永远不会的。你是我认识的最坚强的人。"

Asuka let out a small hiccup which seemed to be concealing a laugh. "Baka," though it was much softer. "Thats not something a girl would want to hear."  
明日香发出一声小小的呃逆，似乎是在掩饰笑声。"笨蛋，"虽然语气柔和了许多。"这不是女孩子想听的话。"

Shinji could have laughed. "Anyway, if you couldn't stand you should have said."  
真嗣本可以笑出声来。"总之，如果你站不住了，应该早点说。"

"...I didn't want to be a bother."  
"...我不想成为麻烦。"

"I'd worry about it nonetheless. Now come on, I'll take you over to the couch."  
"尽管如此，我还是会担心。来吧，我带你去沙发那边。"

"...Wait, Shinji. What are you...WHAAAAA?"  
"...等等，真嗣。你在做什么...哇啊啊啊？"

Asuka's protests were silenced as Shinji brought his left arm up and snaked it around Asuka's shoulders, while his right arm took her off her feet and ended up resting just under her thighs. So, in one fluid motion, Shinji ended of sweeping her off her feet. Which Asuka wasn't terribly thrilled at, as his right arm was dangerously close to her butt.  
当真嗣抬起左臂，绕过明日香的肩膀，同时右臂将她从脚上抱起，最终停在她大腿下方时，明日香的抗议声戛然而止。就这样，真嗣以流畅的动作将她横抱起来。明日香对此并不十分高兴，因为他的右臂离她的臀部太近了。

"Shinji...what are you doing...?"  
“真嗣……你在干什么……？”

Shinji could hear the obvious threat in her voice but didn't care, at least she was feeling better if she was able to talk like that. Though as he glanced down at her face which was frowning up at him he had to turn his eyes away quickly. She was blushing. Was she embarrassed? It seemed nothing would surprise him after the events of today.  
真嗣能听出她声音中的明显威胁，但他并不在意，至少她能这样说话说明她感觉好些了。然而，当他低头看到她皱着眉头看着他时，他不得不迅速移开视线。她脸红了。她是在害羞吗？经历了今天的事情后，似乎没有什么能再让他感到惊讶了。

Answering in a way that sounded like he didn't care, he replied, "This is the easiest way to move you, and its not like you're heavy or anything." 'More like you're too light," he mumbled in his mind. He felt now that she had been pushing herself to hard through the training and remembered that they had skipped meals occasionally. He rebuked himself for those times.  
他回答时那种满不在乎的语气让人听不出他的真实想法：“这是最轻松的移动你的方式，而且你也不重。”他心里嘀咕着，“更像是太轻了。”他现在感觉到她训练时太过拼命，想起了他们偶尔会错过吃饭的时间。他为自己那些时候的疏忽而自责。

Setting her down on the couch he propped a pillow behind her head and drew a blanket across her chest.  
他将她安置在沙发上，垫了一个枕头在她头后，又拉过一条毯子盖在她胸前。

"...Hang on I'll get you some tea."  
“...等一下，我去给你倒杯茶。”

"Hrm," mumbled Asuka as she curled up in the blanket.  
"嗯，" 明日香咕哝着，蜷缩在毯子里。

Walking out of the living room Shinji entered the kitchen and quickly busied himself with making tea, and rather strong at that. He had found Misato's stash of hard liquor while cleaning one day and figured that Asuka could use some of it.  
走出客厅，真嗣进入厨房，迅速忙碌起来，准备泡茶，而且还是相当浓的那种。他在某次打扫时发现了美里藏的烈酒，心想明日香或许需要来点。

Pouring something that had an alcohol content of forty-seven percent in the cup of tea, he carried it to the couch where Asuka had sat up to accept it.  
他将酒精含量高达四十七度的某种液体倒入茶杯中，然后端到沙发前，明日香已经坐起身来准备接过。

"Thanks," she mumbled. "谢谢，" 她咕哝道。

Taking a long gulp of it, her face turned sour for a moment as she thought about spiting it out.  
她大口喝下，脸上瞬间露出苦相，差点想吐出来。

"What the hell did you put in this?"  
"你到底在这东西里加了什么？"

"...Something to make it a little bit stronger."  
"...加点东西让它更强劲些。"

"Tastes like shit." "味道跟屎一样。"

"Its the thought that counts."  
"心意最重要。"

"I suppose...well, it certainly warmed me up."  
"我想...嗯，确实让我暖和起来了。"

A moment of silence passed between the two as Asuka held the half empty cup in her hands. Even without drinking any, the warmth that it still radiated was enough to warm her up significantly. That, and the fact that Shinji had made it.  
两人之间静默了片刻，明日香双手捧着那半满的杯子。即便没有喝上一口，它依然散发出的温暖已足以让她感到相当暖和。再加上这是真嗣泡的。

"I knew this would happen. Even so though, I had wished that it wouldn't."  
"我就知道会这样。尽管如此，我还是希望它不会发生。"

Shinji sat down on the floor in front of her and frowned up at her.  
真嗣在她面前坐在地板上，皱着眉头抬头看她。

"You mean you knew that your father would reappear? What made you think that?"  
“你是说你早就知道你父亲会再次出现？是什么让你这么认为的？”

"I don't know. Well...no, thats not true. My father can be very possessive at times. I figured he'd come looking for me when I had aged a little, since I look almost exactly like my mother. Even though he said all those things about my mother whenever he was drunk, he still cared for her. I think that he sees herself living through me."  
“我不知道。嗯……不，那不是真的。我父亲有时候占有欲很强。我想，当我长大一些，因为我长得几乎和我母亲一模一样，他会来找我的。尽管他每次喝醉时都会说那些关于我母亲的话，但他仍然关心她。我觉得他通过我看到了自己的影子。”

"Thats a twisted way of thinking. So what? He says he wants to see you again because you look like your mother?"  
"那是一种扭曲的思维方式。所以呢？他说他想再见你是因为你长得像你母亲？"

"Yeah, something like that, I think."  
"是啊，大概是这样，我想。"

"Bastard needs to stop living in the past. You are yourself, not some ghost of your dead mother."  
"那混蛋得停止活在过去。你是你自己，不是你已故母亲的幽灵。"

"As I said he's too possessive. He just wants to see the image of his wife in me."  
"正如我所说，他太过占有欲强了。他只是想在我身上看到他妻子的影子。"

Shinji snarled angrily at that point and stood up.  
听到这里，真嗣愤怒地咆哮着站了起来。

"I won't...no I can't. Something...just like that. Its just...disgusting. I swear that if he tries something like this again I'll step on him with Eva."  
"我不会...不，我不能。这种事...简直...令人作呕。我发誓，如果他再敢这样做，我会用 Eva 踩扁他。"

"Heh, heh, heh," after a short pause Asuka said, "thanks...Shinji. If you weren't there...I don't know how I would have dealt with it."  
"嘿嘿嘿，"短暂的停顿后，明日香说道，"谢谢你……真嗣。如果你不在那里……我不知道该怎么应对。"

"You won't have to worry about it again!"  
"你不必再担心了！"

Asuka at that time wearily shook her head and looked at the carpet with downcast eyes, "Thats not entirely true. He'll catch me off guard one day. I don't know what his job consists of right now, but I think he's a CEO in some company. He'll hire someone and eventually meet me through that guy."  
那时，明日香疲惫地摇了摇头，垂眼看着地毯，"那并不完全正确。总有一天他会让我措手不及。我不知道他现在的工作内容是什么，但我想他在某个公司担任 CEO。他会雇人，最终通过那个人与我见面。"

Shinji was shocked at how well Asuka had thought out these multiple scenarios. It showed how much she had prepared for this day.  
真嗣对明日香能如此周密地设想这些多种情况感到震惊。这显示了她为这一天做了多少准备。

"No...its better if I do this how I planned it..."  
“不……我还是按照原计划来比较好……”

Shinji flinched at her words. "What do you mean?"  
真嗣听到她的话后退缩了。“你这是什么意思？”

"This is my problem okay!" Said Asuka flaring up for a moment. "This is something that is my problem! I want to resolve this my way! I don't want to rely on anybody else to resolve this!"  
"这是我的问题，好吗！" 明日香一时激动地说道，"这是我的问题！我想用自己的方式解决！我不想依赖任何人来解决这个问题！"

A stunned silence passed between the two of them after her outburst. Shinji opened his mouth angrily to tell her that he didn't care. That he would help out anyway, when she cut him off.  
她的爆发之后，两人之间陷入了震惊的沉默。真嗣愤怒地张开嘴，想要告诉她他不在乎。他会无论如何都会帮忙，但她打断了他。

"No means no! Now stop asking!"  
"不就是不！现在别再问了！"

Shinji closed his mouth in a dejected way. Every fiber in his body was screaming out against her demand.  
真嗣沮丧地闭上了嘴。他身体的每一根神经都在尖叫着反对她的要求。

Her mood seemed to turn cool then as she looked around the state of the living room. "Even though last night was the last night to sleep in here we never did got around to moving back to our rooms."  
她的情绪似乎在那时变得冷淡起来，环顾着客厅的状况。“即使昨晚是最后一晚在这里睡觉，我们也没能搬回各自的房间。”

"...Yeah I suppose so..."  
“……是啊，我想也是……”

"No reason in going back now I suppose. Well, since it doesn't matter, I'm calling the couch."  
"现在回去也没什么理由了吧。好吧，既然无所谓，我就睡沙发了。"

'I'd give it to you even if didn't say that,' Shinji thought.  
'即使你没说，我也会给你的。' 真嗣心想。

"Oh...and, uh, Shinji/" "哦...还有，呃，真嗣/"

"Hmmm?" “嗯？”

Shinji turned towards Asuka to see her sitting up with her hands in her lap. Shifting her lower body left and right it seemed like she was building up for something.  
真嗣转向明日香，看到她正坐起身，双手放在膝上。她左右挪动着下半身，似乎在为某事做准备。

"What?" Shinji asked again.  
“什么？”真嗣再次问道。

"I was hoping that you could sleep next to me tonight..."  
“我希望能和你今晚一起睡……”

"...ehh? ...WHAT?" "...嗯？...什么？"

"BAKA! I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT! PERVERT!"  
"笨蛋！我不是那个意思！变态！"

"Then how the hell did you mean it!"  
"那你到底是什么意思！"

"Well...that is...I mean. I wanted you to sleep on the ground next to the couch." Asuka said this last part very fast, while a light tinge of pink started to appear on her cheeks.  
"嗯...那个...我的意思是，我想让你睡在沙发旁边的地上。" 明日香最后这句话说得飞快，同时她的脸颊上开始泛起一抹淡淡的红晕。

"...I suppose... But why? If you don't mind."  
"...我想... 但为什么呢？如果你不介意的话。"

"...I think I'd feel better if I knew you were close..."  
"...我觉得如果知道你就在附近，我会感觉好一些..."

Shinji stuttered over his next words, "Ye-Yeah...sur-sure. No-no problem."  
真嗣结巴着说出下一句话，“也、也是……没、没问题。”

Asuka frowned at him and tutted slightly while thinking, 'Jeez, he doesn't have to get worked up so much.'  
明日香皱眉看着他，轻声咂舌，心想：‘天哪，他没必要这么紧张。’

Dragging his futon over towards the couch he laid it out next to it. Turning off the lights hastily he turned back to his futon and laid down on it. He could just make out the shape of Asuka's arm as it was laying next to the edge of the couch. Turning over on his side he closed his eyes and prepared to drop off to sleep when he felt her nudging his side.  
他拖着被褥走向沙发，铺在旁边。匆忙关掉灯后，他转身回到被褥上躺下。他能隐约看到明日香的手臂，它正搭在沙发边缘。他侧过身去，闭上眼睛准备入睡，这时感觉到她轻轻推了推他的侧身。

"Hey Shinji." "嘿，真嗣。"

Flipping over onto his other side he practically hissed, "What."  
他翻身到另一侧，几乎是咬牙切齿地说："干嘛。"

Asuka was on her other side now, looking down at him with her hand extended and her index finger recoiled slightly as though preparing to flick him in the head. Shinji flinched at the gesture and closed his eyes, expecting to feel a sharp pain through his nose. What happened was much different.  
明日香现在也侧躺着，手伸向他，食指微微弯曲，似乎准备弹他的头。真嗣被这动作吓得一缩，闭上眼睛，以为会感到鼻子上传来一阵剧痛。但发生的事情却截然不同。

Shinji had to open his eyes to confirm what had just transpired as he thought his brain must have temporarily turned off. Starting at the outline of Asuka's slightly smirking face, his eyes traveled down her arm and towards her hands. In the end he went cross eyed trying to see if what she was doing was true.  
真嗣不得不睁开眼睛确认刚刚发生的事情，他以为自己的大脑可能暂时关闭了。他的目光从明日香微微带笑的脸庞轮廓开始，顺着她的手臂向下移动，最终聚焦在她的手上。最后，他因为试图看清她是否真的在做那件事而变得眼花缭乱。

Asuka had her index finger pressed softly against Shinji's lips. Shinji felt his heart speed up and slow down maniacally in the span of three-seconds and thought that he might be having a heart attack. Her finger was unusually warm.  
明日香用食指轻轻按在真嗣的嘴唇上。真嗣感到自己的心跳在三秒钟内疯狂加速又减速，他以为自己可能心脏病发作了。她的手指异常温暖。

Looking back up at her smirking face Shinji saw thought he saw a glint in Asuka's eyes before she whispered, "Oyasumi."  
再次看向她那带笑的脸庞，真嗣觉得他看到了明日香眼中的一丝闪光，然后她轻声说道：“晚安。”

Pulling her index finger off his lips she flipped back over to her other side, let out a small yawn, and drifted towards sleep.  
她从他的唇上抽回食指，翻了个身，打了个小哈欠，渐渐沉入梦乡。

Shinji lay there for what felt like a decade before he came to his senses. Taking his own index up towards his lips he pressed them there for a minute before letting his arm flop useless at his side. He really didn't understand, but was happy as it was.  
真嗣躺在那里，感觉像是过了一个世纪才回过神来。他抬起自己的食指触碰嘴唇，停留了一会儿，然后无力地让手臂垂在身侧。他真的不太明白，但这样已经很开心了。

"Oyasumi," he mumbled before closing his eyes.  
“晚安，”他咕哝着，闭上了眼睛。

---

Shinji didn't dream that night, which was certainly a blessing. Though he felt that sleep left him too soon as something was pushing him roughly on the back.  
那一夜，真嗣没有做梦，这无疑是一种恩赐。尽管他觉得睡眠结束得太快，因为有什么东西在粗暴地推他的背。

"Shinji...OI, SHINJI!" “真嗣...喂，真嗣！”

Snapping his eyes open, he turned towards to the sound of the complaining. Asuka was sitting up on the couch while her legs were resting on Shinji's back. Glancing at the alarm clock on the other side of the room he saw that it read eight o'clock.  
他猛地睁开眼睛，转向那抱怨声的方向。明日香正坐在沙发上，双腿搭在真嗣的背上。他瞥了一眼房间另一边的闹钟，看到上面显示着八点。

"Uhh, to early," he mumbled while pushing Asuka's legs off him.  
"呃，太早了，" 他咕哝着把明日香的双腿从自己身上推开。

"No its not, and I'm hungry."  
"不早了，我饿了。"

"Its a weekend, lets sleep longer."  
"今天是周末，让我们多睡一会儿吧。"

"That should be my complaint. C'mon...make me breakfast."  
"那应该是我的抱怨。来吧...给我做早餐。"

Pushing against his back, Asuka ended up rolling Shinji over onto his stomach and then back onto his side.  
阿斯卡用力推他的背，结果把真嗣翻了个身，先是趴着，然后又侧躺着。

Turning towards her Shinji glared at her briefly, though it soon evaporated to that of a smirk. Her face looked like that of a child's on Christmas Eve.  
转向她，真嗣短暂地瞪了她一眼，但很快变成了得意的笑容。她的脸看起来就像圣诞前夜的孩子一样。

"Oh fine..I'm getting up."  
"哦好吧...我起床了。"

Shinji yawned widely and crawled out from under his blankets. Walking on tired legs, he slowly made it to the kitchen with the assistance from the wall as a support. Asuka walked behind him smiling widely the entire time.  
真嗣打了个大大的哈欠，从被窝里爬了出来。他拖着疲惫的双腿，靠着墙壁的支撑，慢慢地走向厨房。明日香跟在他身后，全程都笑得十分灿烂。

"Ok Asuka what do yo- ...Misato?"  
"好吧，明日香，你要我做什...美里？"

Shinji was looking at his guardian who was seated at the kitchen table with a spoon half way to her mouth.  
真嗣看着他的监护人，她坐在餐桌前，勺子半举在嘴边。

"...Oh, Shinji. Asuka. Morning."  
“……哦，真嗣。明日香。早上好。”

"...When did you get back?"  
“……你什么时候回来的？”

"Hmmm...a few hours ago I suppose. I can't remember last night very well."  
"嗯……我想是几个小时前吧。昨晚的事我记得不太清楚了。"

"Yeah I can smell-I mean tell."  
"是啊，我能闻到——我是说察觉到。"

"Hmph." "哼。"

Misato turned back to her measly breakfast as a small sigh escaped her lips. "So how come the dead-bolt was locked-"  
美里转回她那简陋的早餐，轻轻叹了口气。“那么，为什么门闩是锁着的？”

Shinji who was in the middle of opening the fridge froze as Asuka did the same thing as she sat down.  
正在开冰箱的碇真嗣僵住了，而坐在一旁的明日香也做了同样的动作。

"-because I seriously doubt that any burglar would bother trying to steal anything from this apartment."  
“——因为我实在不认为会有哪个小偷会费心从这间公寓偷东西。”

Shinji glanced over at Asuka quickly as he straightened up, though she didn't want to meet his gaze. She had become extremely interested in a pattern on the wooden table. Trying to pass it off, Shinji said, "Oh that? It was supposed to be a way to get back at you, for the training. In case you didn't have your key, you would have been locked out."  
真嗣迅速瞥了一眼明日香，随即挺直身子，但她并不想与他对视。她的注意力完全被木桌上的一个图案吸引住了。为了掩饰尴尬，真嗣说道：“哦，那个啊？原本是想报复你训练时的事，万一你没带钥匙，就会被锁在外面。”

"Hmph, not very thought out, and not a very good lie."  
“哼，考虑不周，也不是个高明的谎言。”

"Lie?" Asked Shinji as he put a glass of orange juice in front of Asuka.  
“谎言？”真嗣一边问，一边在明日香面前放了一杯橙汁。

"Yes, lie." "是的，撒谎。"

Shinji and Asuka both flinched in silence waiting for the hammer to drop.  
真嗣和明日香都沉默地缩了一下，等待着那不可避免的打击降临。

Sighing again, Misato leaned back in her chair and mumbled, "When I came home earlier this morning there was a man sitting on the stairs at the bottom of this apartment complex. He seemed to be mumbling Asuka's name over and over."  
再次叹了口气，美里向后靠在椅背上，喃喃自语道："今天清晨我回家时，在公寓楼的楼梯底部坐着一个男人。他似乎一直在反复念叨着明日香的名字。"

At her words Asuka accidently knocked the fresh glass of orange juice off the table where it met the hard ground with a shattering sound.  
听到她的话，明日香不小心将刚倒好的橙汁从桌上碰落，玻璃杯与坚硬地面相撞，发出破碎的声响。

Shinji stood there helplessly as Misato uttered a few words.  
真嗣无助地站在那里，听着美里说出几句话。

"Asuka...is he your father?"  
“明日香……他是你父亲吗？”

The walls came crashing down again as Asuka shuttered uncontrollably, and Shinji wasn't next to her. What separated the two of them was a wooden countertop that Shinji suddenly wanted to dive over to comfort her.  
墙壁再次轰然倒塌，明日香不由自主地颤抖着，而真嗣不在她身边。隔开两人的是一块木制柜台，真嗣突然有种冲动，想要越过它去安慰她。

"...Asuka," he mumbled, not knowing what to say.  
“……明日香，”他喃喃道，不知该说什么。

Misato turned her eyes towards him and he caught her meaning only to clearly, though he didn't like it. 'This is something she has to overcome. Stay out of it for now.'  
美里将目光转向他，他立刻明白了她的意思，尽管他并不喜欢这样。‘这是她必须克服的。现在先别插手。’

Turning back to Asuka, Misato saw that she had raised her face and muttered, "Yeah...that bastard is my father."  
转向明日香，美里看到她抬起脸，低声说道：“是啊……那个混蛋是我父亲。”

Shinji was shocked at how strong her voice was. It was like all doubt had been removed from her mind.  
真嗣对她的声音之坚定感到震惊。仿佛她心中的所有疑虑都已烟消云散。

"...So he is..." “……所以他真的是……”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"And? Are you going to talk to him?"  
"然后呢？你打算和他谈谈吗？"

It took all of Shinji's willpower to not blow up then. How could she even ask something like that? Though it was Asuka's reply that really threw him for a loop.  
那一刻，真嗣几乎用尽所有意志力才没有爆发。她怎么可能问出这样的问题？然而，真正让他感到意外的是明日香的回答。

"I think that I might...in the end."  
"我想我最终可能会...去和他谈谈。"

Shinji stood there dumbstruck at her words.  
真嗣站在那里，被她的话惊得目瞪口呆。

"...wha?" "...啥？"

Turning towards him Asuka said, "I thought I told you last night Shinji, that I wanted to do this my way. So would you stop worrying about me!"  
转向他，明日香说道：“真嗣，我昨晚不是告诉过你吗，我想按自己的方式来做。所以你能不能别再担心我了！”

"...I..." "...我..."

"Shinji," murmured Misato, "let Asuka decided. It is her life after all."  
"真嗣," 美里轻声说, "让明日香决定吧。毕竟这是她的人生。"

Shinji couldn't take any more.  
真嗣再也承受不住了。

"How the hell can you even be suggesting that she talks to her father! Do you know what the bastard has done...tried to do!"  
"你他妈怎么还能建议她去跟她父亲说话！你知道那混蛋做了什么...试图做什么吗！"

"Of course I know all about her past. I'm her guardian. I was given papers by the German branch of Nerv explaining everything about her."  
"我当然知道她的一切过去。我是她的监护人。德国分部 Nerv 给了我所有关于她的资料，解释了一切。"

"Then how the hell can you go along with this!"  
"那你怎么还能同意这种事！"

"Because its not my decision! Its hers!"  
"因为这不是我的决定！是她的！"

Shinji seemed to deflate, all the anger seeping out him.  
真嗣似乎泄了气，所有的怒气都从他身上消散了。

"Fine, whatever." "好吧，随便。"

"...Shinji," mumbled Asuka.  
"...真嗣," 明日香咕哝道。

"Go! If you want to talk to him so bad go!"  
"去吧！如果你这么想跟他说话就去吧！"

"Fine...I will." "好吧...我会去的。"

Standing up quickly Asuka trotted to her room, dressed quickly and took off out the door.  
阿斯卡迅速起身，快步走向她的房间，迅速穿上衣服，然后冲出门去。

Shinji meanwhile had turned the other way and was forcing himself to not take off after her. How could she be so stupid? Did she honestly want to talk to her useless father? Of course not!  
与此同时，真嗣转向了另一个方向，强迫自己不要追上去。她怎么能这么愚蠢？她真的想和那个无用的父亲谈话吗？当然不是！

"Shinji?" “真嗣？”

"...What?" "...什么？"

Turning back around, Shinji saw that Misato had her elbows resting on the table and had abandoned her breakfast. "Do think you know what's best for Asuka?"  
转过身来，真嗣看到美里将手肘撑在桌上，放弃了她的早餐。“你觉得自己知道什么对明日香最好吗？”

"Of course not. But I have enough sense to know that this is not!"  
“当然不知道。但我有足够的理智知道这绝不是！”

"Do you think this is what she wants?"  
"你觉得这是她想要的吗？"

He had to use every ounce of willpower to not shout.  
他不得不动用每一分意志力来克制自己不喊出声。

"No, of course not." "不，当然不是。"

Leaning back in her chair Misato muttered, "You don't really realize what's going through Asuka's head. Do you?"  
米萨托靠在椅背上喃喃自语，“你真的不知道明日香心里在想什么。对吧？”

"I don't rea...what is that supposed to mean!"  
“我不明白……你这是什么意思！”

Standing up quickly, Misato let her chair fall backwards and said quite passively, "Asuka wants to reconcile with her dad!"  
米萨托迅速站起身，椅子向后倒去，她相当平静地说道，“明日香想和她爸爸和好！”

"..."

"...What? That...can't be. How can she trust him...after... NO! THATS WRONG!"  
"...什么？那...不可能。她怎么能在...之后还信任他...不！那是错的！"

"Shinji listen to me." "真嗣，听我说。"

"NO! I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN!"  
"不！我不能让那种事发生！"

"SHINJI!" "真嗣！"

"WHAT!" "什么！"

"SIT DAMN IT AND LISTEN TO ME!"  
"坐下，该死的，听我说！"

Something about Misato's words seemed to draw him. Misato rarely had an outburst and this was the first that he could remember. Looking towards the door that he was half way to already, he looked back at the seat that she was pointing at.  
米萨托的话似乎吸引了他。米萨托很少情绪爆发，这是他记忆中的第一次。他朝已经走了一半的门口望去，又回头看了看她所指的座位。

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

"Fine..." “好吧……”

Turning around he walked back to the chair, crossed his arms and sat down.  
他转过身，走回椅子旁，交叉双臂坐了下来。

Misato sighed, picked up the chair that she had kicked aside, and sat down in it. Crossing her own arms and even her legs she frowned at the stubborn teenager that was sitting across from her.  
美里叹了口气，捡起她踢到一旁的椅子，坐了下来。她交叉双臂，甚至双腿，皱着眉头看向对面那个固执的少年。

"Shinji, don't you think your being a bit prejudice because of your own father."  
“真嗣，你不觉得自己因为父亲而有些偏见吗？”

"My own...what?" “我自己的……什么？”

"Look, to put it simply...you've never had a family. You were to young when your mother died and can't remember her. Your father...well, yes he left you, and so you've never known what family is like. So you can't understand how Asuka felt before her mother died."  
"听着，简单来说...你从未有过家庭。你母亲去世时你还太小，记不得她。你父亲...嗯，是的，他离开了你，所以你从未体验过家庭的滋味。因此，你无法理解明日香在她母亲去世前的心情。"

"But what does that-" "但这意味着什么-"

"It means, that deep down Asuka wishes for the days when she still had a family. Even if she doesn't want to admit it she still misses her father. Her father is the only relative that she still has. Well, I know that she has a grandmother on her mothers side but I don't think she's ever talked to her."  
"这意味着，明日香内心深处渴望着她还有家庭的日子。即使她不愿承认，她仍然想念她的父亲。她的父亲是她仅存的亲人。嗯，我知道她母亲那边还有个祖母，但我觉得她从未与她交谈过。"

"But what if-" "但如果万一——"

"You need to stop living in the past. Stop shoving your own hatred of your father onto Asuka. Don't you want her to be happy about this."  
"你得停止活在过去。别再把你自己对你父亲的恨意强加给明日香了。难道你不希望她为此感到高兴吗？"

"Well yes, but-" "嗯，是的，但是——"

"Shinji...are you worried that Asuka will leave?"  
"真嗣...你担心明日香会离开吗？"

An erie silence filled the house at her words. Shinji hadn't had time to think about something like this. Though now it certainly felt like a possibility. If Asuka and her father made up then she might move away. Of course she'd still be needed for Eva, but her father might move down here to be with her.  
她的话语让屋内弥漫着一种诡异的寂静。真嗣之前并未考虑过这样的问题。但现在，这确实成了一个可能。如果明日香和她父亲和好了，她可能会搬走。当然，她仍会被需要驾驶 EVA，但她的父亲可能会搬到这里来陪她。

"I haven't thought of that."  
"我还没想过这一点。"

"But its still possible."  
"但可能性依然存在。"

"...Yes, I suppose it is."  
"……是的，我想是的。"

"If Asuka does leave she will still be needed at Nerv. She's to deeply involved to simply be released now."  
"如果明日香离开，她在 NERV 仍会被需要。她牵涉得太深，现在不可能轻易脱身。"

"So at best I'll see her at Nerv and maybe at school."  
"所以最多我只能在 Nerv 见到她，或许还有学校。"

"Hmmm. She could change schools of course."  
"嗯，她当然可以转学。"

"This is all assuming that she will reconcile with her father."  
"这一切的前提是她能与父亲和解。"

"You still doubt her?" "你还在怀疑她吗？"

"No...I doubt her father."  
"不...我怀疑的是她父亲。"

"Well I can't deny that he was a bastard for what he did. But if it makes you feel a little better I did some research on him when Asuka first came to the Tokyo-3 branch. Apparently he became sober shortly after Asuka left. He seemed to realize that he had chased his daughter away. Shortly after he help a friend out with some business transactions, and was offered a position at a large investments firm. Earlier this year he was promoted to a CEO."  
"好吧，我不能否认他做那些事确实是个混蛋。但如果你觉得好受点的话，我在明日香刚来东京-3 分部时调查过他。显然，明日香离开后不久他就戒酒了。他似乎意识到自己把女儿赶走了。不久后，他帮一个朋友处理了一些商业交易，并被一家大型投资公司录用。今年早些时候，他被提拔为 CEO。"

"Sound like he got his shit together."  
"听起来他总算把自己的事情理顺了。"

"Well, thats one way of putting it."  
"嗯，这么说也行。"

The two lapsed into silence and shifted there eyes to the door at the end of the hallway. Would Asuka really decide to leave? Did she want to make up with her father like Misato said? Shinji was unsure about the things rushing through his head but knew that he'd be by Asuka's side if she needed him. He could promise her that much.  
两人陷入了沉默，目光转向走廊尽头的那扇门。明日香真的会决定离开吗？她是否像美里所说的那样，想要与父亲和解？真嗣脑海中涌动着种种疑问，但他知道自己会站在明日香身边，如果她需要他的话。他至少能向她承诺这一点。

Letting out a low sigh Misato stood up and said, "Well, no use in worrying about something thats already transpired."  
美里轻轻叹了口气，站起身来说道：“唉，已经发生的事情，再担心也没用了。”

"...Yeah I guess." “……是啊，我想也是。”

"Well I'm going to sleep."  
“好了，我要去睡了。”

"Huh?" “啊？”

"I haven't slept since two nights ago. I'm beat. Uh I think I might have had too much alcohol also."  
"我从两晚前就没睡过。累坏了。呃，我觉得我可能也喝多了点酒。"

Shinji blinked and replied, "I didn't think the words 'alcohol and too much' would ever come out of your mouth."  
真嗣眨了眨眼，回答道：“我没想到‘酒精和过量’这种词会从你嘴里说出来。”

"What? I'm still human after all."  
“什么？我毕竟还是个人类嘛。”

"Hmm, yeah." "嗯，是啊。"

Shinji stood up along with her and was just thinking of laying back down when the apartment door opened and in walked Asuka. Shinji could see her father standing a ways away and had to suppress the urge to glare at him as she closed the door.  
真嗣跟着她站了起来，正想着再躺回去时，公寓的门开了，明日香走了进来。真嗣看到她的父亲站在远处，不得不压下瞪他的冲动，在她关上门时。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

"Err...is everything okay?"  
"呃……一切都还好吗？"

"Ah, yeah its fine. ...I'm going out for a while-  
“啊，嗯，没事的。……我要出去一会儿——”

Shinji frowned. It really did seem like she wanted to talk with her father. The corners of her mouth were pulled up slightly. Though it seemed she was trying to suppress the swelling feeling in her stomach.  
真嗣皱了皱眉。她似乎真的很想和父亲谈谈。她的嘴角微微上扬。尽管她似乎在努力压抑着胃里翻涌的感觉。

-so I thought I'd just let you know."  
——所以我想还是告诉你一声。”

"Ah...okay..." "啊...好的..."

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

"Its fine," he mumbled while turning around. "If this is what you want then I shouldn't stop you."  
"没关系，"他嘟囔着转过身。"如果这是你想要的，那我就不该阻止你。"

"...Thanks for understanding. ...Cya later then."  
"...谢谢你的理解。...那回头见。"

Asuka turned around and had just put a hand on the door nob when she felt something grab her other hand. Turning her head she saw that Shinji was looking keenly at her, as though his eyes could pierce the hesitancy in her heart.  
明日香转过身，手刚放在门把手上，就感觉到另一只手被什么东西抓住了。她转过头，看到真嗣正热切地注视着她，仿佛他的目光能穿透她心中的犹豫。

"Be sure to call if anything happens..."  
"有事一定要打电话..."

"...I will..." "...我会..."

Relinquishing the firm grasp on her hand, Shinji watched as she hurriedly opened the door. Looking back at him, she gave him a reassuring smile before turning to her father with an equally wide smile on her face. As the door swung closed Shinji had difficulty suppressing the emotion that were welling up inside of him. He didn't know when he'd see her again.  
松开紧握她的手，真嗣看着她匆忙打开门。回头望向他，她给了他一个安心的微笑，然后转向她的父亲，脸上同样挂着灿烂的笑容。随着门缓缓关闭，真嗣难以抑制内心涌动的情感。他不知道何时才能再次见到她。

---

Shinji ended up going back to sleep, even though he felt wide awake before. He just didn't know what he was supposed to do in a situation like this. Running away from the present was all he felt like doing, and thats why he decide to sleep for the remainder of the day. Though it was still difficult. He floated in and out of his dreams and everything seemed to co-mingle, and lead to a depressing future. One that didn't involve Asuka.  
真嗣最终还是回去睡觉了，尽管之前他感觉异常清醒。他只是不知道在这种情境下该做什么。逃离现实是他唯一想做的事，因此他决定睡上一整天。尽管这依然很困难。他在梦境中时隐时现，一切都似乎交织在一起，导向一个令人沮丧的未来。一个没有明日香的未来。

It felt weird when he sat up suddenly, all sleepiness apparently gone, though he wasn't particularly sleepy in the first place. At first he thought that somebody had woken him up but realized that there was no one else in the room besides.  
他突然坐起身，所有的睡意似乎都消失了，虽然一开始他并不特别困。起初他以为有人叫醒了他，但随即意识到房间里除了他没有其他人。

'Thats right, Asuka's off for a bit.' He said just a bit but in reality he was nervous about never seeing her again. What if something happened between her and her father and he got violent again. Would she be able to escape and return? Or would he find her and-  
'没错，明日香暂时离开了。'他虽然说只是暂时，但实际上他担心可能再也见不到她了。万一她和她父亲之间发生了什么事，他又变得暴力起来。她能逃脱并回来吗？还是他会找到她——

"Fuck no!" He yelled while standing up. "Thats not gonna happen!"  
"绝不！"他站起来大喊。"那绝不会发生！"

"Eh, what's not gonna happen?"  
“呃，什么不会发生？”

Shinji had to blink several times to get his eyes back into focus. The slow form of Misato started to appear in front of his eyes. 'So this is what being drunk is like,' he thought.  
真嗣不得不眨了几次眼，让视线重新聚焦。米莎托的缓慢身影开始出现在他眼前。‘这就是喝醉的感觉啊，’他想。

"Misato?" "美里？"

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"Is Asuka back yet?" “明日香回来了吗？”

"Nope, its only been a few hours. Its only around noon."  
"没有，才过了几个小时。现在才中午左右。"

"Ah...I see." "啊...我明白了。"

"Anyway could you do me a favor?"  
"那么，你能帮我个忙吗？"

"...Like what?" "...比如什么？"

"Ah...well, I'd do it myself but I've got a splitting head ache. So could I ask you to run over to Rei's apartment and give this to her."  
"啊...好吧，我自己去的话头会很疼。所以能请你跑一趟，把这个交给丽吗？"

"Give? ...Wait huh? Ayanami?"  
"交给？...等等，绫波？"

"Yes, this." Holding out a small laminated card Shinji saw that it was a security card with Rei's face and profile on it.  
"是的，这个。" 伸出一小张塑封卡片，真嗣看到那是一张安全卡，上面印着绫波的脸部和简介。

"Is this a security card?"  
"这是一张安全卡吗？"

"Precisely. Hers expired so I need to give it to her. Could you to give it to her"  
"正是。她的过期了，所以我需要交给她。你能帮我转交给她吗？"

"Erm...well I suppose so."  
“呃……嗯，我想是的。”

"Ah thanks. I wasn't sure how I was suppose to give it to her. Anyway here's her address. Do you know where it is?"  
“啊，谢谢。我不确定该怎么给她。总之，这是她的地址。你知道在哪里吗？”

Shinji glanced down at the street and number. He had passed it many times when he used to take his evening strolls.  
真嗣低头看了看街道和门牌号。他以前在傍晚散步时曾多次经过那里。

"Yeah, I'm familiar with the area."  
"是的，我对这一带很熟悉。"

"Ah, good. Well off you go then."  
"啊，那就好。那么，你走吧。"

"Ah...okay. ...Wait. Has anybody called?"  
"啊...好的。...等等。有人打电话来吗？"

Misato seemed to see through his casual comment and said, "Don't worry I'm sure that Asuka is fine."  
美里似乎看穿了他随意的评论，说道：“别担心，我相信明日香没事。”

"...Yeah. Well cya." “……嗯。那再见。”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

Shinji tossed a pair of socks and socks on with a sweater that he grabbed out of his room. It looked like it would rain soon.  
真嗣扔了一双袜子，套上从房间里抓出的毛衣。看起来很快就要下雨了。

Sure enough, as he made his way down the steps of the apartment complex, he felt the first droplets of rain. Looking up at the sky he saw dark grey clouds hovering overhead. It seemed that it would get nasty soon and a thundershower looked possible. He was inadvertently reminded about his first encounter with Asuka and the subsequent task of hauling her back in the freezing could rain. He hoped that something similar wouldn't happen.  
果然，当他走下公寓楼的台阶时，感觉到了第一滴雨。抬头望向天空，只见头顶上乌云密布。看来很快就会变得恶劣，雷阵雨似乎有可能发生。他不经意间想起了与明日香初次相遇的情景，以及随后在冰冷的雨中将她拖回来的任务。他希望类似的事情不会再次发生。

---

"I suppose this is the place," Shinji mumbled as he stood outside of a door in the freezing cold. The walk was longer than he remembered and he had gotten soaked on the way. Now though, he was standing with a soaking sweatshirt and equally soaking pants, standing outside of a door that read Ayanami Rei on the door.  
“我想这就是地方了，”真嗣在寒风中站在一扇门外喃喃自语。这段路比他记忆中的要长，而且他在路上已经湿透了。现在，他站在一扇写着“绫波零”的门前，身上湿漉漉的毛衣和同样湿透的裤子让他感到十分不适。

Not noticing a door bell anywhere he knocked on the door twice and muttered.  
没有发现门铃，他敲了两次门，低声嘀咕道。

"Ah, Ayanami...its me...Shinji. Umm...I've got something that Misato wanted me to give you. So if you could...open the door...or something."  
“啊，绫波...是我...真嗣。呃...美里让我给你带点东西。所以如果你能...开下门...之类的。”

Shinji realized then that this was probably the most he had ever said to Rei.  
真嗣那时意识到，这可能是他对绫波说过最多话的一次了。

After waiting there for several minutes he started to get annoyed. Without thinking about the consequences he muttered, "I'm coming in," and turned the door nob. In reality he hadn't been expecting it to be unlocked and now had no choice but to enter the small apartment.  
在门外等了几分钟后，他开始感到不耐烦。没多想后果，他咕哝了一句“我要进来了”，便转动门把手。实际上，他并没料到门会没锁，现在别无选择，只能走进那间小公寓。

He was first impression wasn't one of glamour, thats for sure. The apartment was one giant room it seemed except for a closet and the bathroom. The kitchen was off to the side which hardly looked as if it had been used and at the far end of the long room was a bed that seemed dark and depressing.  
他的第一印象绝非光鲜亮丽，这一点毋庸置疑。公寓似乎只有一个巨大的房间，除了一个壁橱和浴室。厨房在一侧，看起来几乎从未使用过，而在长房间的尽头是一张显得阴暗压抑的床。

Taking his shoes off he walked through the small apartment and ended up looking down at the bed where Rei must sleep each night. It really seemed like it had not been used in ages. The small table next to it seemed similar as dust had settled on it. Did someone even live here?  
他脱下鞋子，穿过狭小的公寓，最终站在雷的床前俯视着。这张床看起来似乎已经很久没人睡过了。旁边的小桌子也相似，灰尘覆盖其上。这里真的有人住吗？

Without knowing what else to do he ended up leaning against the wall opposite the table. Pulling out the security card that Misato had give him he glanced at it. Rei really was an unusual person. Even though all the info about her person was on the card, he still felt that something was lacking. He couldn't quite place it though.  
不知该做什么，他最终靠在桌子对面的墙上。拿出美里给他的安全卡，他瞥了一眼。丽确实是个与众不同的人。尽管卡上有她所有的个人信息，他仍觉得缺少了些什么。但具体是什么，他又说不清楚。

As he was about to place it back in his pocket he heard the opening and closing of a door, which made him jump and drop the card that he was holding. Bounding off against the wall he swiped the card off the ground and skidded into view of Ayanami Rei who had just opened the door to her apartment.  
正当他准备将卡片放回口袋时，他听到了开门和关门的声音，这让他吓了一跳，手中的卡片也随之掉落。他迅速从墙边跳起，从地上抓起卡片，滑行到绫波零的视线中，她刚刚打开了自己公寓的门。

Under normal circumstances, and a normal girl, Shinji would have found himself getting a face full of pepper spray and a kick to the crotch. Instead though Rei seemed to completely ignore his existence, place the bag she was carrying on the kitchen and stroll past him.  
在正常情况下，面对一个普通女孩，真嗣可能会遭遇满脸的胡椒喷雾和一脚踢向胯部。然而，零似乎完全无视了他的存在，将手中的袋子放在厨房，然后径直从他身边走过。

Shinji hesitated before he turned his head to see what she was doing, and almost face palmed. She was changing. If he hadn't been living with Asuka and Misato for over a month this might have made him die of a nose bleed. Instead he turned his head back around and waited until she was done. Though really nothing had changed, as she was wearing the same school uniform that she always wore. What, did she have twenty pairs of the same outfit? Asuka would have a fit at her wardrobe.  
真嗣犹豫了一下，然后转头看她在做什么，差点捂脸。她在换衣服。如果不是和明日香及美里同居了一个多月，这情景可能会让他流鼻血而亡。相反，他转回头，等待她换完。尽管实际上什么都没变，她穿的还是那套校服，她总是穿的那套。难道她有二十套同样的衣服吗？明日香看到她的衣柜肯定会发疯。

Turning around, he had to take a step back as he found that she had closed the distance between them. He was looking back into her crimson eyes.  
转过身，他不得不后退一步，因为她已经拉近了他们之间的距离。他再次迎上了她那双深红色的眼睛。

"Why are you here?" She asked, though without anger.  
“你为什么在这里？”她问道，语气中并无怒意。

"Oh...that, right." “哦...那个，对了。”

Reaching into his pocket he pulled out the security card that Misato had given him.  
他伸手从口袋里掏出了美里给他的安全卡。

"Misato wanted me to give this to you."  
“美里让我把这个交给你。”

Blinking as though she didn't understand she held out her hand and Shinji let it slide into her outstretched palm.  
她眨了眨眼，仿佛没明白，随即伸出手，真嗣便将卡片滑入她摊开的掌心。

With saying anything else she deposited the card on the table and walked towards the kitchen to put away the things she got.  
没再多说什么，她将卡片放在桌上，走向厨房去收拾刚买回来的东西。

Not sure what to say in her presence, Shinji gestured around the apartment and said, "Nice place."  
在她面前不知该说什么，真嗣环顾了一下公寓，说道：“挺不错的地方。”

'Couldn't I have thought of something a little better than that,' he sighed in his mind?  
“我就不能想出点更好的话吗，”他在心里叹息道？

"It suits me." “很适合我。”

Shinji turned towards her and saw that her expression had not changed at all. Not sure of what to say anymore he muttered, "Well, I guess I'll take off then."  
真嗣转向她，发现她的表情完全没有变化。不确定该说什么了，他低声咕哝道：“嗯，我想我该走了。”

Walking past her silently he reached the door and was about to turn the nob when she mumbled.  
他默默地从她身边走过，到达门口，正要转动门把手时，她喃喃自语。

"Goodbye." “再见。”

Shinji's eyes darted back towards her, but her expression had still had changed as she started opening cupboards. Well, at least she had opened up a little. Turning the door nob, he walked out into the pouring rain.  
真嗣的目光再次投向她，但她已经开始打开橱柜，表情依旧未变。好吧，至少她稍微敞开了些心扉。他转动门把手，走进了倾盆大雨中。

---

"So? How did it go?"  
“那么？情况如何？”

"Huh?" “啊？”

"I mean talking with Rei. How did it go?"  
"我是说和丽交谈。情况怎么样？"

"How was it supposed to go," mumbled Shinji back at Misato?  
"还能怎么样，" 真嗣咕哝着对美里说？"

"I was just curious if you were nervous at all"  
"我只是好奇你是否感到紧张"

"A little I suppose, since I don't know her all that well."  
"我想有一点吧，毕竟我对她了解不多。"

"Well, thats understandable. She doesn't talk all that much with everyone, except for the commander of course."  
"嗯，这可以理解。她不怎么和所有人说话，除了指挥官当然。"

"The comman-...my father?"  
"指挥官...我父亲？"

"Yeah, thats what we're supposed to call him at Nerv."  
“是的，在 NERV 我们得这么称呼他。”

"I always forget that he's an important figure there. So she talks to my father?"  
“我总是忘记他在那里是个重要人物。那她和我父亲交谈吗？”

"Yeah, quite animately in fact."  
“是的，实际上相当生动活泼。”

"...I can't imagine anybody talking to my father and enjoying the conversation."  
"...我无法想象有人和我父亲交谈还能享受那个过程。"

"Thats because you've never tried yourself."  
"那是因为你从未亲自尝试过。"

"Can't deny that. Well, I'm going back to sleep."  
"这一点我无法否认。好吧，我要回去睡觉了。"

"Huh? Why?" "嗯？为什么？"

Shrugging, Shinji said, "No reason. Just nothing else to do today."  
真嗣耸了耸肩，说道：“没什么特别的原因。只是今天没什么其他事情可做。”

"Admit it. You're just waiting till Asuka gets home."  
"承认吧。你只是在等明日香回家。"

"Am not! I just...don't have anything else to do today is all."  
"才不是！我只是...今天没什么其他事情要做罢了。"

"Hai, Hai. Keep telling yourself that."  
"是，是。你就继续这么告诉自己吧。"

"Ah, Urusai." "啊，吵死了。"

---

Again. 再一次。

Shinji sat bolt upright in his bed. After a rather reluctant argument with himself, he decided to move the futons back to their respected room, including Asuka's. Now he was in his room, in his own futon, with his body entangled in the blankets. The dream that had woken him up had not been pleasant. No, words couldn't even describe it.  
真嗣猛地从床上坐直。经过一番不情愿的自我争论后，他决定将被褥搬回各自的房间，包括明日香的。现在他回到了自己的房间，躺在自己的被褥里，身体被毯子缠绕着。那个将他惊醒的梦并不愉快。不，用言语甚至无法形容。

Spinning around, he first looked out the small window and was shocked to see that night had already fallen. Turning the other way, he glanced at the clock that was on his small dresser. It read seven-thirty. Something seemed to click in his head. Seven-thirty?  
他转过身，首先望向小窗外，惊讶地发现夜幕已经降临。转向另一边，他瞥了一眼放在小梳妆台上的时钟。上面显示七点半。他脑海中似乎有什么东西被触动了。七点半？

At the sudden realization at how long he had been sleeping he quickly jumped up and threw open the door. Darkness greeted him. Apparently he was the only other person in the house. Misato must have gone out not long ago and...Asuka. Where was Asuka?  
突然意识到自己睡了多久，他迅速跳起来，猛地推开门。迎接他的是一片黑暗。显然，他是家里唯一醒着的人。美里一定不久前出去了，还有……明日香。明日香在哪里？

Walking into the living he quickly flipped on the lights and glanced around. He didn't see any changes since he moved stuff back to there rightful place. Even the couch didn't seem like anybody had been on it since morning.  
走进客厅，他迅速打开灯，环顾四周。自从他把东西搬回原位后，似乎没有任何变化。就连沙发也好像从早上起就没人坐过。

Next second a blue flash seared in front of the window and made Shinji jump. It seemed that it was still raining, and had worsened.  
下一秒，一道蓝光在窗前闪过，让真嗣吓了一跳。看来雨还在下，而且变得更糟了。

Furthermore, it was late at night and still Asuka hadn't come back. 'Well, maybe she had left a message,' Shinji told himself.  
此外，已是深夜，而明日香仍未归来。'嗯，或许她留了消息吧，'真嗣自言自语道。

No message. Looking at the cordless phone he instantly knew that she hadn't called as there wasn't a blinking light. Now he was starting to get worried.  
没有留言。他瞥了一眼无绳电话，立刻明白她没有来电，因为没有闪烁的指示灯。现在他开始感到担忧了。

'Well, I suppose she could have gotten sidetracked while with her father and-'  
'嗯，我想她可能和她父亲在一起时被什么事情耽搁了——'

Somebody knocked on the door.  
有人敲了门。

Shinji spun around so quickly that he cricked his neck and at the same time froze. If it was Misato or Asuka why would they bothering knocking on the door. Unless Misato had locked it before she left and now Asuka was standing there infuriated that she was locked out.  
真嗣猛地转身，快得扭到了脖子，同时僵住了。如果是美里或明日香，他们为什么要敲门呢？除非美里离开前锁了门，现在明日香正站在外面，因为被锁在外面而气愤不已。

Gathering himself as he walked towards the door, he at first thought of opening it without worrying who it was, but decided on the safer course of action. This wasn't the most friendly neighbor hood in Tokyo-3 Shinji had learned.  
他一边走向门口，一边整理思绪，起初想着不问是谁就开门，但最终还是选择了更安全的做法。真嗣已经了解到，这是第三新东京市里不太友好的街区之一。

"Ah...who is it." “啊……是谁？”

"...Me..." “……是我……”

Shinji tore the door open so hard that the hinges threatened to snap off. Breathing heavily, as though he had just ran a mile, he was looking at a soaking wet Asuka who's face was currently aimed at the ground. Only now did Shinji remember what she had left in. This morning no one would have guessed that the weather would have turned out so nasty. The sun was out without a trace of clouds in the sky. Four hours later the sky looked like someone had painted it grey.  
真嗣用力拉开房门，力度之大仿佛要将铰链扯断。他喘着粗气，仿佛刚跑完一英里，目光投向浑身湿透的明日香，她的脸此刻正对着地面。直到这时，真嗣才想起她早上穿的是什么。今早没人料到天气会变得如此恶劣。阳光明媚，天空万里无云。四小时后，天空却像是被人涂成了灰色。

Asuka had been in such a hurry that morning that she had thrown on a pair of jean-like shorts that went down to her knees, while she wore a white sleeveless shirt with a pair of sandals. Certainly not the type of clothes you'd want to walk around in the rain with.  
那天早上，明日香匆匆忙忙，随手套上了一条类似牛仔裤的及膝短裤，穿着一件白色无袖衬衫和一双凉鞋。显然，这不是你想在雨中漫步的服装类型。

Her strawberry colored hair was messy, and plastered all over her face. She was shivering uncontrollably and seemed to have tears running down her face. It didn't help that her shirt was completely see through, revealing the white bra underneath.  
她那草莓色的头发凌乱不堪，贴满了整张脸。她不停地颤抖，脸上似乎还挂着泪水。更糟糕的是，她的衬衫完全透明，露出了里面的白色胸罩。

Shinji stood in the warmth of the apartment, while Asuka stood on the doorstep in the freezing rain. The two contrasts couldn't have been more different.  
真嗣站在温暖的公寓里，而明日香则站在门口的冰冷雨中。两者的对比再鲜明不过了。

Unable to say a word Shinji took a few small steps forward until he was directly in front of her. He could feel the warm breath as it tumbled out of her mouth and landed on his face.  
无法说出任何话，真嗣向前迈了几小步，直到直接站在她面前。他能感觉到她温暖的呼吸从口中喷涌而出，落在他的脸上。

Opening his mouth to the smallest degree, one would have thought he was a ventriloquist as he whispered, "Hey...Asuka..."  
他微微张开嘴，仿佛是个腹语者一般轻声低语，"嘿...明日香..."

Her shoulders seemed to tremble violently at the sound of his voice. Slowly shifting her head to look up at him, she opened her mouth a fraction of an inch and whispered back, "S-Shi-Shin-shinji...Shinji!...Shinji!...SHIN-"  
听到他的声音，她的肩膀似乎在剧烈颤抖。她缓缓转过头来，抬头看着他，微微张开嘴，轻声回应，"真-真-真嗣...真嗣！...真嗣！...真-

Shinji cut her off before she was able to continue. Wrapping one arm around her waist and clasping his hand in hers, he pulled her forcefully through the door with such ferocity that he was afraid he might have pulled her arm out of its socket. To anybody that was watching this it would have looked like they were dancing.  
真嗣在她继续说之前打断了她。他用一只手臂环住她的腰，握住她的手，猛地将她拉过门去，力度之大以至于他担心可能会把她胳膊拽脱臼。在旁人看来，这一幕倒像是在跳舞。

Quickly slamming the door he turned to the dripping wet Asuka where a puddle had started to form beneath her. He had over a hundred questions to ask her, each one more reluctant than the last. But he knew he'd have to eventually. First though he had to get her out of those wet clothes.  
他迅速关上门，转身面对浑身湿透的明日香，她脚下已经开始形成一滩水迹。他有一百多个问题想问她，每个问题都比前一个更犹豫。但他知道终究得问出口。不过首先，他得让她换掉那身湿衣服。

"C'mon...lets get you out of those wet clothes first. You must be freezing."  
“来吧...我们先帮你把湿衣服换掉。你一定冻坏了。”

Asuka didn't acknowledge that she heard him, nor did she even seem to recognize where she was. Maybe she thought she was still out in the rain.  
明日香没有回应他，甚至似乎没有意识到自己在哪里。也许她以为自己还站在雨中。

Taking matters into his own hands he grabbed both her hands this time and steered her towards her own room. Moving the door open with his foot he pulled her gently into her own room and had her sit on her futon while he searched for something warm.  
他决定亲自行动，这次紧紧抓住她的双手，引导她走向自己的房间。用脚推开门，他轻轻地将她拉进房间，让她坐在被褥上，同时寻找着暖和的东西。

"Uh lets see...hmmm...this will do I suppose," he mumbled to himself after settling on a large red sweater and a long pair of pants. Though things didn't go as smoothly as he wished.  
“呃，让我看看……嗯……这个应该可以吧，”他自言自语道，最终选定了一件大红色毛衣和一条长裤。虽然事情并没有像他希望的那样顺利。

After grabbing a towel from the bathroom and wrapping her wet hair in it he encountered a problem. Asuka didn't seem willing or able to change out of her clothes. Shinji wasn't sure, nor did he want to know what had triggered this helplessness. But he certainly had a good idea and could feel the blood pounding in his ears as he thought about killing the man.  
从浴室抓了条毛巾，将她湿漉漉的头发裹起来后，他遇到了一个问题。明日香似乎既不愿意也不可能换掉她的衣服。真嗣不确定，也不想知道是什么引发了这种无助感。但他确实有个不错的猜测，一想到要杀掉那个人，他就能感觉到血液在耳中轰鸣。

After turning over many ideas in his mind he decided to just go with the most blunt option...and help her into her clothes. Finding a long black sock in his room, he tied it securely around the back of his head so that it would cover his eyes. He was determined to keep her dignity in tact.  
在脑海中翻来覆去地思考了许多方案后，他决定采取最直接的方法——帮她穿上衣服。在房间里找到一只长长的黑色袜子，他将其紧紧地绑在脑后，确保能遮住眼睛。他决心维护她的尊严。

After much hassle while trying to get her shirt off she finally seemed to get the idea and complied with his actions. It was a lot more difficult then he imagined, as he had to do it solely through touch and experiment. Normally he would have been killed twenty times over. Ten for even thinking about doing this, and another ten for even attempting it.  
在费尽周折试图帮她脱下衬衫后，她终于似乎明白了他的意图并配合了他的行动。这比他想象的要困难得多，因为他只能通过触摸和尝试来完成。通常情况下，他早就被杀了二十次了。十次是因为哪怕只是想这么做，另外十次是因为居然还敢尝试。

After finally getting her to kick off her shorts, he was rather reluctant to continue with the next step and was extremely glad when she spoke up.  
终于让她脱掉了短裤后，他对下一步相当犹豫，当她开口时，他感到非常庆幸。

"Enough...I'm not a child."  
“够了……我不是小孩子。”

Sighing in a weary and happy way, he mumbled, "Glad to see that you've come to your-"  
他疲惫而幸福地叹了口气，喃喃道：“很高兴看到你终于……”

"KEEP THAT FUCKING THING ON!"  
"把那该死的东西戴上！"

Shinji was just in the middle of pulling the sock down, so that it didn't cover his eyes anymore, when his hand was grabbed and forcefully removed from the sock.  
真嗣正要把袜子拉下来，这样它就不会再遮住他的眼睛了，这时他的手被抓住，并强行从袜子上移开。

"What are you-" "你在干什么——"

"I'm changing out of my underwear damn it! Keep that damn thing on until I say so. And don't even think about look-"  
"我正换内衣呢，该死的！在我允许之前，别脱那该死的东西。而且别想着偷看——"

"I don't think you have to worry about me looking. After practically stripping you with my own two hands I think I've had enough for one night."  
"我觉得你不用担心我会偷看。亲手帮你脱得差不多了，今晚我已经看够了。"

Shinji heard a sharp intake of breath then and flinched as he thought he was about to get slapped across the face. Though no stinging sensation appeared on his face.  
真嗣听到一声急促的吸气声，然后缩了缩身子，以为自己要被扇耳光了。不过脸上并没有出现火辣辣的感觉。

After several minutes of hearing her shifting clothes around, Shinji was allowed to take off his rudimentary blind fold.  
在听到她摆弄衣服几分钟后，真嗣终于被允许摘下他那简陋的眼罩。

"About time..." “终于……”

"Shut it." “闭嘴。”

Asuka had changed into what Shinji had chosen and was wearing the red sweatshirt and dark blue jeans. It also seemed that she had chosen a long sleeve shirt underneath the sweatshirt, though Shinji could only see the sleeve of it. She still had the towel around her head and was now rubbing her wet hair with it.  
明日香已经换上了真嗣挑选的衣服，穿着红色运动衫和深蓝色牛仔裤。她似乎还在运动衫里面穿了一件长袖衬衫，不过真嗣只能看到袖子部分。她头上依旧裹着毛巾，现在正用它擦拭湿漉漉的头发。

"...Hey...lets go into the living room."  
“...嘿...我们去客厅吧。”

"...Why?" "...为什么？"

"I want to know why you've come home in the soaking wet rain of course. C'mon, I'll make you some hot chocolate."  
“我当然想知道你为什么会在大雨中淋得湿透回家。来吧，我给你弄点热巧克力。”

"...It's fine." "...没事的。"

"No it isn't actually!" "其实不是这样的！"

"I thought I told you to let me worry about my own problems!"  
"我记得我告诉过你，让我自己操心我的问题！"

"Damn it! Do you know how worried I was! I slept most of the day because I didn't want to face the reality that you might leave."  
"该死！你知道我有多担心吗！我一整天大部分时间都在睡觉，因为我不想面对你可能离开的现实。"

"...Worried?" "...担心？"

"Yes. So let me help you. No, I want to help you."  
"是的。所以让我帮你。不，我想要帮你。"

"Shin-ji." "真嗣。"

Tears started to well up in Asuka's eyes, but she brushed them to the side with the back of her hand.  
泪水开始在明日香的眼中打转，但她用手背迅速拭去。

"Hmm. Okay." "嗯，好吧。"

Taking Asuka's hand, he pulled her out of her sitting position, and into the living room. Leading her to the couch, he wrapped a blanket around her shoulders, and hurried off to make the hot chocolate.  
他牵起明日香的手，将她从坐姿中拉起，带进了客厅。领她到沙发前，他用毯子裹住她的肩膀，然后急忙去准备热巧克力。

After rummaging around in the cupboard he found some cocoa and marshmallows and quickly added the hot milk.  
在橱柜里翻找了一番后，他找到了一些可可粉和棉花糖，迅速将其加入热牛奶中。

Rushing back to the living room, he was surprised to find that she had turned the T.V. on was now slouching on the couch cushions. Maybe nothing had really happened and she had just decided to walk home. Though he couldn't see any sane parent letting their child walk home in this weather.  
他急匆匆地回到客厅，惊讶地发现她已经打开了电视，正懒洋洋地躺在沙发垫上。也许什么都没发生，她只是决定自己走回家。尽管他无法想象有哪个理智的家长会让孩子在这样的天气里独自走回家。

"Here," he mumbled while holding out the cup to her.  
"给，" 他咕哝着，将杯子递给她。

"Oh...thanks." "哦……谢谢。"

Taking it from his hands she immediately took a large swig and immediately burned her tongue.  
她从他手中接过杯子，立刻猛喝一口，随即烫到了舌头。

"Ahhhh! Hot!" "啊！好烫！"

"What'd you expect, lukewarm?"  
"你以为会是什么，温温的吗？"

"...Shut it." "……闭嘴。"

"Before I even thinking about keeping quiet I want to know exactly what happened today. Why did you suddenly decide to talk to your father? Its not certainly not because you mis-"  
"在我考虑保持沉默之前，我想确切地知道今天发生了什么。你为什么突然决定和你父亲谈话？这肯定不是因为你误——"

"Don't say it!" "别说了！"

"Do you?" "你真的知道吗？"

"...I don't know! Stop bothering me, damn it!"  
"...我不知道！别烦我了，该死！"

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

Asuka turned slowly towards Shinji as he sat down on the couch next to her.  
明日香缓缓转向真嗣，他正坐在她旁边的沙发上。

"Are you...lonely?" "你...感到孤独吗？"

"Lonely? Tch, as if thats something I'd even worry about."  
"孤独？哼，那种事我怎么会在意。"

"You are, aren't you!" "你就是，对吧！"

"No! I'm! Not! Baka!" "不！我！没！有！笨蛋！"

"Damn it! Listen to me Asuka! No, look at me."  
"该死！听我说，明日香！不，看着我。"

Asuka had turned away from him and was now watching the T.V. though not really seeing it.  
明日香已经转过身去，现在正盯着电视，尽管并没有真正在看。

"...I'm not lonely. I don't need help. I don't want help. I can be by myself. I don't need friends. I need only pilot E-"  
"...我不孤单。我不需要帮助。我不想要帮助。我可以一个人。我不需要朋友。我只需要驾驶 E-"

"...Stop...just stop it all ready."  
"...停下...快停下，已经够了。"

Shinji cut her off abruptly by wrapping his arms around her middle. At first she tried to push them away, but finally gave in to his assertion.  
真嗣突然用双臂环抱住她的腰，起初她试图推开，但最终还是屈服于他的坚持。

"...I...didn't want to be alone. ...I wanted to be loved by him again. I wanted to have a family again."  
"...我...不想独自一人。...我想再次被他爱着。我想再次拥有一个家。"

"...Asuka you fool!" "...Asuka 你这个傻瓜！"

Asuka turned her head towards him angry but was silenced as Shinji tightened his grip around her middle.  
Asuka 愤怒地转向他，但当 Shinji 收紧环绕她腰间的手臂时，她沉默了。

"Idiot! What am I and Misato then? Coworkers? Look at who's around you. Touji, Kensuke, Hikari, Ritsuko...me and Misato. What are we to you? Aren't we friends? Even Ayanami is your friend."  
"笨蛋！那我和 Misato 算什么？同事吗？看看你周围的人。Touji、Kensuke、Hikari、Ritsuko...还有我和 Misato。我们对你来说算什么？难道不是朋友吗？就连 Ayanami 也是你的朋友。"

Asuka scoffed lightly at the mention of Rei's name. She wasn't sure if she would ever be able to have a conversation with her and enjoy it. But she was starting to understand what Shinji was talking about.  
听到丽名字时，明日香轻蔑地哼了一声。她不确定自己是否能和丽进行一次愉快的对话。但她开始明白真嗣所说的意思了。

"...Asuka...that father of yours could never understand the friendship that everybody has formed with you. So what if you don't have a proper family! I don't either! But I'm able to continue because I have you, Misato, and everybody else by my side. I use to hate everybody...because nobody loved me. I wanted everybody to just disappear so I'd never have to related to anybody else. But, I learned that that was just to painful. ...If everybody was to leave...I don't want to go back to what I once was."  
"...明日香...你父亲永远无法理解大家与你建立的友谊。没有完整的家庭又怎样！我也没有！但我能继续前行，因为有你、美里和大家在我身边。我曾经恨过所有人...因为没有人爱我。我希望所有人都消失，这样我就不必再与任何人产生联系。但后来我明白，那样太痛苦了。...如果大家都离开...我不想回到过去的样子。"

"...Shin-" "...真-

"So don't leave! Don't leave with that bastard! Stay here with everybody and continue enjoying your life here! Where you belong!"  
"所以别走！别跟那个混蛋走！留在这里和大家一起，继续享受你的生活！这才是你该在的地方！"

"...Shin-ji..." "...真嗣..."

Breathing heavily after unleashing his pent up thoughts since he knew that Asuka might be leaving, he unwrapped his arms around her middle and turned the opposite direction.  
在发泄了自从得知明日香可能离开后积压已久的情绪后，他重重地喘着气，松开了环绕在她腰间的手臂，转向了相反的方向。

"So don't leave...ever..."  
"所以不要离开...永远..."

"..."

"Now...why were you outside in the freezing rain, because if it has anything to do with that bastard I'm gonna-"  
"现在...你为什么在外面冰冷的雨中，如果和那个混蛋有关，我就要-"

"Its not what you think. It was my decision to be out there."  
"不是你想的那样。在外面是我自己的决定。"

"But why were yo-" "但为什么你——"

"...Because of my father."  
"……因为我的父亲。"

"Then it is his-" "那么这是他的——"

"Shut it for a minute and let me talk."  
"闭嘴一会儿，让我说。"

"...Fine..." "...好吧..."

"...Okay so I was somewhat glad that I was able to talk to him again. I hadn't talked to him for five years so of course I was happy. He took me out to lunch in his new Mercedes and we went shopping afterwards. Overall I had a good time. Then though he started talking about how he wanted to see me more, like bringing me back with him to Germany. I told him that it was impossible since I was to heavily involved with Nerv here. He said that I could just work at the German branch."  
"...好吧，我很高兴能再次和他交谈。我已经五年没和他说过话了，所以当然我很开心。他带我去他的新奔驰车里吃午饭，然后我们去购物。总的来说，我过得很愉快。但后来他开始谈论他想多见我，比如带我回德国。我告诉他这不可能，因为我在这里与 Nerv 有很深的牵扯。他说我可以在德国分部工作。"

"After that things started to go down hill. It was obvious that he wanted to spend more time with me...but I just wasn't ready for that. After everything that he had done how could I be? Though what really pissed me off was when he introduced me to his new wife. I felt like I was looking at my dead mother."  
"自那以后，事情就开始走下坡路。很明显，他想花更多时间和我在一起...但我还没准备好。经历了那么多，我怎么可能准备好呢？真正让我恼火的是，他把我介绍给了他的新妻子。我感觉像是在看我已故的母亲。"

Shinji opened his mouth, but closed it quickly. He could guess where this was going.  
真嗣张开嘴，但很快又闭上了。他猜到这会往哪儿发展了。

"In short, she looked so much like my mother that it was disgusting. He wasn't happy enough that he had me, his daughter, the splitting image of my mother. He had to go and fuck around with other woman, and I know they were fucking as she was pregnant...four months she has."  
"简而言之，她长得太像我母亲了，令人作呕。他有了我，他的女儿，和我母亲如出一辙还不够。他还要和其他女人鬼混，我知道他们在鬼混，因为她怀孕了...已经四个月了。"

A small silence appeared at her words in which Shinji wasn't sure if he should talk or remain quiet.  
她的话语间出现了一小段沉默，这让真嗣不确定自己是该说话还是保持安静。

"After learning that I'd be living with a woman that looked exactly like my mother and a child that would look the same, I decided I had had enough. My fathers personality had not changed in those five years. He may not have touched a bottle of beer in years but he was still the same selfish bastard that I hated. I left them. And guess what? He'd didn't even bother looking for me. He was to busy talking with his new wife about what the baby's bedroom was going to be like and whether it was a boy or a girl. He didn't even care in the end about the daughter that he already had."  
在得知我将和一个长得和我母亲一模一样的女人以及一个长相相似的孩子一起生活后，我决定我受够了。我父亲的个性在这五年里丝毫未变。他可能多年未沾啤酒，但依然是我所憎恨的那个自私的混蛋。我离开了他们。你猜怎么着？他甚至都没费心找过我。他忙着和他的新妻子讨论婴儿房的布置，以及孩子是男是女。最终，他连自己已有的女儿都不在乎了。

Shinji digested everything in his mind, but the same thing still came out. Her father had abandoned her once again.  
真嗣在心中消化着这一切，但结论依旧不变。她的父亲再次抛弃了她。

"...Its unforgivable," he whispered.  
"...这是不可原谅的，"他低声说道。

"I don't care anymore. I'm done with him. If he comes crawling back to me this time I'll kick him in the crotch and tell him to get the fuck out of my sight."  
"我再也不在乎了。我受够他了。如果这次他爬回来求我，我会一脚踢在他裤裆上，叫他滚出我的视线。"

"Good...he deserves it." "好...他活该。"

"...Ah I'm tired now, after all this talking."  
"...啊，说了这么多，现在累了。"

"Well, your futon is in your room again."  
"对了，你的被褥已经放回你房间了。"

"Speaking of my room, what made you think you had the right to help me dress?"  
"说到我的房间，你凭什么觉得有权帮我更衣？"

"...That was because you didn't seem capable!"  
"...那是因为你看起来没那个能力！"

"Whether I was or not, doesn't matter. Pervert!"  
"我是不是，并不重要。变态！"

"God your so-" "天啊，你真是——"

The front door opened. 前门打开了。

Shinji and Asuka both turned their heads towards the sound of the door and heard the shuffling of feet across the wooden floor.  
真嗣和明日香同时转向门口的声响，听到了脚步在木地板上拖动的声音。

"Misato?" "美里？"

"Oh Shinji I'm so glad that you're here...Oh Asuka good your here also. Listen we have a problem."  
“哦，真嗣，我真高兴你在这里……哦，明日香，太好了，你也来了。听着，我们有个问题。”

"What?" "什么？"

"Well...while walking back to the apartment from my car...I-I met Asuka's father."  
"嗯...从车里走回公寓的路上...我...我遇到了明日香的爸爸。"

Shinji felt Asuka's entire body seize up next to him and instinctively reached out and grabbed ahold of the hand closest to him.  
真嗣感觉到明日香整个人在他身边僵住了，本能地伸出手，抓住了离他最近的那只手。

"What did you say," whispered Shinji?  
"你说了什么？" 真嗣低声问道。

"Asuka's father is outside the front door and demanding to see Asuka. He said something like he's taking her away, and that she's better off not staying here anymore. Hang on...I'll contact Nerv and get him arrested-"  
"明日香的父亲在前门外面，要求见明日香。他说什么要带她走，还说她最好别再待在这里了。等等……我联系 Nerv 让他被逮捕——"

"No...I'll take care of this," whispered Shinji calmly. His voice held venom in it.  
"不……我来处理，" 碇真嗣平静地低语。他的声音中带着毒意。

"Shinji he's an adult. What do you plan to do?"  
"真嗣，他是个成年人。你打算怎么做？"

"...What I should have done yesterday."  
"...昨天我应该做的事。"

"SHINJI WAIT!" "真嗣，等等！"

Standing up hurriedly before Misato could stop him, he didn't even realize that Asuka was still holding firmly onto his hand. So before he knew that she was next to him, as he was opening the front door.  
在美里阻止他之前匆忙站起来，他甚至没有意识到明日香还紧紧抓着他的手。所以在打开前门之前，他并不知道她就在他身边。

"About time," said a snarling voice.  
"终于来了，"一个咆哮的声音说道。

Shinji froze. No...it wasn't.  
真嗣僵住了。不...不是的。

Reality was to cruel. 现实太过残酷。

Shinji was looking back at the subject of his nightmares for the last week.  
真嗣正回望着过去一周里他噩梦的源头。

Asuka's father had a long, tan, overcoat on over the slacks and dress-shirt that he was wearing. In addition he had a hat on, pulled low over his eyes, so that Shinji could only see the whites of his eyes in the lack of light. His dreams had finally come to fruition. How could he have been so stupid to not realize this sooner?  
明日香的父亲穿着一条长长的、棕褐色的风衣，里面是裤子和衬衫。此外，他还戴着一顶帽子，帽檐压得很低，遮住了眼睛，以至于真嗣只能在昏暗的光线中看到他眼白的部分。他的梦境终于变成了现实。他怎么会这么愚蠢，没有早点意识到这一点呢？

Taking a rather hesitant step backwards, he felt pressure on his left hand and looked around to see Asuka leaning up against him, with both her hands holding onto his. It seemed to give him new strength as he glared murderously back at his enemy. With the blooding pounding in his ears, and his entire body shaking angrily, he managed to get out a few simple words.  
他有些犹豫地后退了一步，感觉到左手上的压力，转头一看，发现明日香正靠在他身上，双手紧握着他的手。这似乎给了他新的力量，他凶狠地瞪向他的敌人。随着耳中血液的轰鸣声，全身因愤怒而颤抖，他勉强挤出了几个简单的词。

"Leave. Asuka doesn't want to stay with you."  
"离开。明日香不想和你待在一起。"

"I think thats my decision and no one else's, kid."  
"我认为这是我的决定，不是其他任何人的，小鬼。"

"No...you're wrong. Its Asuka's decision above all else. And she has decided to stay here."  
"不...你错了。这是明日香的决定，最重要的是她的决定。而她已经决定留在这里。"

"I'm her father! I make the rules! And I'm telling her to return with me to Germany!"  
"我是她父亲！我制定规则！我命令她跟我回德国！"

Shinji felt Asuka shiver next to him and had to restrain himself from not breaking her father in half.  
真嗣感觉到身边的明日香在颤抖，他不得不克制自己不去把她的父亲撕成两半。

"I'll say it again. Leave."  
"我再说一遍。离开。"

"And I'm saying that I don't take orders from a kid like you! You will return my daughter to me-"  
"我说的就是你这样的小鬼没资格命令我！你必须把我女儿还给我——"

"Father!" "爸爸！"

Shinji and Asuka's father both turned their heads to the strong voice of the frightened girl clutching her friends hand.  
真嗣和明日香的爸爸都转向了那个害怕的女孩，她紧紧抓着朋友的手，声音坚定。

"I'm no longer your daughter. You don't have one. You lost the privilege to call me your daughter a long time ago. Leave! I don't want to have to listen to your sniveling bitching anymore."  
“我不再是你的女儿了。你没有女儿。你很久以前就失去了叫我女儿的资格。走开！我不想再听你那哭哭啼啼的抱怨了。”

Asuka's father was rendered speechless for a minute before lashing out in anger. His face twisted into a sickening grimace as he retorted, "Tch, spoiled brat. Fine be that way. Stay here for all I care, I never cared for you anyway. In the end you're just like your mother. A slu-"  
明日香的父亲一时语塞，随后愤怒地爆发了。他的脸扭曲成一副令人作呕的鬼脸，反驳道：“哼，被宠坏的小鬼。随你便吧。我根本不在乎你，你爱待在这儿就待着。说到底，你和你妈一个样。一个贱——”

...Snap... ...啪...

Shinji's fist collided directly against the side of his face, instantly shattering his jaw, and connecting with his temple. His bottom and lower jaw overlapped each other quickly with the sound of two rocks being ground together. His lower jaw unhinged from the top and seemed to dangle their effortlessly, tearing apart the bottom lip and ripping the roots of his teeth out in the process. Blood spewed forth from his opened mouth as the top part of jaw bit down on his tongue, ripping off a piece of it in the process. The slimy substance slid out of his mouth and onto the ground. The force of Shinji's blow had even broken apart some of the cartilage in his noes, making him bleed from the nostrils.  
真嗣的拳头直接撞上了他的脸颊，瞬间击碎了他的下颌，并击中了他的太阳穴。他的下颌和下巴迅速重叠，发出两块石头摩擦般的声音。下颌从上颚脱臼，似乎毫不费力地悬挂着，撕裂了下唇，并在过程中拔出了牙齿的根部。血液从他张开的嘴里喷涌而出，上颚部分咬住了舌头，撕下了一块。这种黏滑的物质从他嘴里滑出，落在了地上。真嗣这一击的力量甚至破坏了他鼻子里的一些软骨，使他鼻孔流血。

Above all else it was the hit to the temple that seemed to do the most damage. Shinji had swung with all his might and had struck a part of the human body that was...rather sensitive. He blacked out almost instantly as the blow to the cranial lobes made blood drip from the ears. The blow had additionally cracked part of the skull.  
最重要的是，击中太阳穴的那一拳似乎造成了最大的伤害。真嗣全力以赴地挥拳，击中了人体一个相当敏感的部位。他几乎立刻就昏迷了，因为对大脑皮层的打击使得血液从耳朵里滴落。这一击还导致了部分头骨的裂开。

The entire thing transpired in less then three seconds as Shinji struck and now looked down at the man which he wondered if he had just killed. A pool of blood was slowly starting to from beneath him and the smell of it was already starting to linger in the air.  
整个过程不到三秒钟，真嗣一击即中，现在正低头看着那个男人，心中疑惑自己是否刚刚夺去了他的生命。一滩血迹正慢慢在他身下形成，血的气味已经开始在空气中弥漫。

Shinji felt a strong throbbing sensation in his hand and looked down to see that he had split open the knuckles in his right hand; the one he had swung with.  
真嗣感到手上传来一阵剧烈的刺痛，低头一看，发现自己右手的指节已经裂开；正是他挥拳的那只手。

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

Shinji wheeled around to see a wide eyed Asuka looking at him while Misato had her mouth wide open behind her.  
真嗣转身看到明日香瞪大了眼睛盯着他，而美里则在她身后张大了嘴巴。

"...Sorry...I couldn't let him talk about you like that. He deserved it."  
"...对不起...我不能让他那样说你。他活该。"

"Shinji," said an exasperated Misato. "You might have killed him."  
"真嗣，"美里无奈地说，"你可能会杀了他。"

"He'd deserve it." His words were ice.  
"他活该。"他的话语冷若冰霜。"

Rushing over to the man laying on the ground, Misato grabbed his wrist and managed to find a weak pulse.  
米萨托冲向躺在地上的男子，抓住他的手腕，设法找到了微弱的脉搏。

"He's alive." “他还活着。”

"I'll fix that really quick," mumbled Shinji as he walked over to the almost dead man, but something grabbed onto his wrists.  
“我马上解决这个问题，”真嗣咕哝着走向濒死的男子，但有什么东西抓住了他的手腕。

Turning around he saw Asuka had one hand on his wrist, while the other was resting on his shoulder.  
他转过身，看到明日香一手抓着他的手腕，另一只手则搭在他的肩膀上。

"Its enough. He'll be lucky to be able to talk after this. I don't want you to have to go to jail because of something like this. He won't go to jail? Will he, Misato?"  
“够了。他这次能说话就算幸运了。我不想你因为这种事进监狱。他不会进监狱吧？会吗，美里？”

"No, he shouldn't. I'll arrange stuff with Nerv and have them claim it was self defense. Considering your fathers record, it'll be believable. Though Shinji...what you did...I still can't-"  
“不，他不会。我会和 NERV 那边协调，让他们宣称这是自卫。考虑到你父亲的记录，这会让人信服。不过，真嗣……你做的事……我还是无法……”

"I'll listen to it later."  
"我稍后再听。"

Turning around, Shinji walked by a wordless Asuka, and walked into his own room before sliding the door closed.  
转身后，真嗣从沉默的明日香身边走过，走进自己的房间，然后滑上了门。

Misato eyed the door heavily before looking back at the man on the ground. Shinji seemed to be showing more signs of aggression lately, making her wonder if piloting Eva Unit 01 was creating these mood swings.  
美里沉重地看了一眼门，然后回头看向躺在地上的男人。真嗣最近似乎表现出更多的攻击性迹象，这让她怀疑驾驶 EVA 初号机是否导致了这些情绪波动。

Really, he needed to learn to grow up.  
真的，他需要学会长大。

---

Shinji rolled over onto his side. His clock read midnight.  
真嗣翻身侧躺着。他的时钟显示是午夜。

Rolling back around he had a sudden urge to vomit. He had just been reliving the nights events, and was still surprised that he had almost killed Asuka's father. He could remember the feel of his fist as it collided with the side of his head and the feeling the as skull as it cracked. It still sent a shiver down his spine. Against all his willpower he had still resorted to violence. Sure he had thought of it, but had never really intended on beating the shit out of him. Even so, he would have done it again most likely, because of what he had said to Asuka.  
他又翻了个身，突然有种想吐的感觉。他刚刚还在重温那晚的事件，仍然惊讶于自己差点杀了明日香的父亲。他记得拳头击中他头部侧面的感觉，以及头骨破裂时的触感。这仍让他脊背发凉。尽管他极力克制，但还是诉诸了暴力。当然，他曾想过，但从未真正打算把他打得半死。即便如此，他很可能会再次这么做，因为他说了那些对明日香的话。

Earlier that night, just before Shinji dropped off to sleep, he remembered Misato talking through his door. She said that Asuka's father had been taken to a Nerv hospital and examined. In order to repair his jaw he would need screws inserted into the bone to hold his jaw in place, not that it would do any good in the first place. The blow to the cranial lobes had apparently done some damage to his brain. All he could do so far was drool and shit himself; talking seemed next to impossible. Big change from the man that was once a big CEO just a few hours ago.  
那天晚上早些时候，就在真嗣即将入睡之际，他记得美里透过他的门说话。她说明日香的爸爸被送到了 NERV 的医院接受检查。为了修复他的下颌，需要将螺丝植入骨头以固定，但这从一开始就没什么用。头部受到的打击显然对他的大脑造成了损伤。到目前为止，他只能流口水和失禁；说话似乎几乎不可能。就在几小时前，他还是一位大公司的 CEO，变化真是巨大。

Well, he considered himself lucky. If he really had killed the man, he didn't think Misato would even be able to gloss over it. She had already spent some time (and money) creating eye witnesses that would testify in court if they had to, saying that it was all self defense.  
好吧，他觉得自己还算幸运。如果他真的杀了那个人，他认为美里甚至无法掩盖这一点。她已经花了一些时间（和金钱）制造目击者，如果需要的话，他们会在法庭上作证，说这一切都是自卫。

He should be happy, but he wasn't. He didn't think that anything productive had come out of his paralyzing a person. He was even slightly worried that Asuka might be mad at him. Above all else he hoped this last part wasn't true.  
他应该感到高兴，但他没有。他不认为让一个人瘫痪有什么积极的结果。他甚至有点担心明日香可能会生他的气。最重要的是，他希望这最后一点不是真的。

"I really screwed up," he mumbled into the night.  
"我真的搞砸了," 他对着夜色喃喃自语。

Sighing heavily he turned around, and laid on his stomach with is head resting under the pillow. He was just thinking about turning his SDAT on and forgetting everything when something surprised him.  
他重重地叹了口气，转过身来，趴在床上，头枕在枕头下。他正想着打开 SDAT，忘掉一切，这时有什么东西让他吃了一惊。

He heard the door sliding open.  
他听到门滑开了。

In his desperate attempt to scramble around to see who it was, he heard somebody hissing through the small gap in the open door.  
在他拼命四处张望试图看清是谁时，他听到有人透过敞开的门缝小声嘶嘶地说着。

"Don't move...don't say anything."  
“别动……什么都别说。”

The voice almost made him yell.  
那声音几乎让他尖叫出声。

"Asu-"

"Quiet, baka." "安静点，笨蛋。"

He blinked several times to try to see any sign of her outline behind the door, but it was just to dark.  
他眨了几次眼，试图在门后看到她的轮廓，但实在太暗了。

After an abrupt silence, Asuka spoke up. "Hey...is it okay if I stay here for a while?"  
在一阵突如其来的沉默后，明日香开口了。"嘿...我可以在这里待一会儿吗？"

"I thought you didn't want me to say anything," Shinji mumbled.  
"我以为你不想让我说什么的，" 真嗣咕哝道。

"...What?" "...什么？"

"Nothing. ...Do as you please."  
"没什么。...随你便吧。"

"Hmm. K'ay." “嗯，可以。”

Shinji rolled back the other way then and closed his eyes. It's not like she needed his permission if she wanted to stay outside his door.  
真嗣翻了个身，闭上了眼睛。她要是想待在他门外，也不需要他的允许。

He completely misunderstood her intensions and realized too late as she slid the door open all the way.  
他完全误解了她的意图，等她把门完全拉开时，他才意识到这一点。

"Wha-What are you?" "你...你是什么人？"

Before he was able to turn around, he heard a soft thud land next to him and felt something soft brush up against his back briefly. Next he heard the rearranging of blankets and realized that she had been way too prepared with her own blanket and pillow.  
在他来得及转身之前，他听到旁边轻轻的落地声，随即感到有什么柔软的东西短暂地拂过他的背部。接着他听到毯子被重新整理的声音，意识到她对自己的毯子和枕头准备得太过充分了。

"Asuka, what are you do-"  
"明日香，你在做什-"

"Don't look over here...stay facing that way."  
"别往这边看...继续朝那边看。"

"...Okay, but why..." "...好吧，但为什么..."

"...I don't honestly know...I just woke up and found myself walking over here with a blanket and pillow. A-Anyways, d-don't get any weird i-ideas. Now keep quiet, I'm going to sleep."  
"...老实说我也不知道...我一觉醒来就发现自己拿着毯子和枕头走过来了。总之，别有什么奇怪的想法。现在安静点，我要睡觉了。"

"No...but this is..." "不...但这可是..."

"What?" "什么？"

"...Nevermind..." "...算了..."

"Hmph." "哼。"

The two lapsed into silence soon. Only now was Shinji self-conscious of what was going on. He was sharing a futon with Asuka. Every guy in his class would give an arm and a leg for this opportunity. He had know idea if she was lonely or what, but was relieved that she still appeared to be on speaking terms with him. But something still nagged at the back of his mind.  
两人很快陷入了沉默。直到现在，真嗣才意识到发生了什么。他和明日香共用一床被褥。班上的每个男生都会为了这个机会不惜一切。他不知道她是否感到孤独，还是别的什么，但令他松了一口气的是，她似乎仍愿意与他交谈。然而，他心中仍有一丝不安挥之不去。

Disobeying her demands he rolled over to look at her and sucked in his breath as he realized he was a mere centimeter away from kissing her. It would have been funny if one of them had sneezed at that point. Asuka appeared to have expected something like this and was obviously waiting for him to do exactly what he just did. Though she didn't seem at all put off that they had almost kissed, rather, she seemed to be enjoying the close contact.  
无视她的要求，他翻身面向她，意识到自己距离吻她仅差一厘米时，不禁倒吸了一口气。如果当时有人打喷嚏，那可真是滑稽。明日香似乎预料到了这种情况，显然是在等他做出刚刚的举动。尽管他们差点接吻，她却丝毫没有感到不悦，反而似乎很享受这种近距离接触。

"So? You want to say something right?"  
“所以？你想说什么吧？”

Shinji turned his head the other way so he was able to breath again.  
真嗣把头转向另一边，这才得以重新呼吸。

"Well, yeah," he muttered.  
"嗯，是啊，" 他咕哝道。

"So what is it?" "那到底是什么？"

"...Are you mad at me."  
"...你在生我的气吗。"

"...Huh? What kind of a question is that? Why would I be mad?"  
"...嗯？这是什么问题？我为什么要生气？"

"...For what I did to your father."  
"...因为我对你父亲所做的事。"

"What, almost killing him? Course I'm not. He deserved it and this means I never have to worry about him again. I should be thanking you."  
"什么，差点杀了他？当然不生气。他活该，这意味着我再也不用担心他了。我应该感谢你。"

"...He still is your father though."  
"...但他仍然是你的父亲。"

"Tch, I don't have a father. I've got friends, a guardian...and you."  
"哼，我没有父亲。我有朋友，有监护人...还有你。"

Shinji didn't quite understand why he wasn't included in the friends category.  
真嗣不太明白为什么自己没有被归入朋友那一类。

"Were you worried about something so trivial as that."  
"你居然会为这么琐碎的事担心。"

"...Yeah." "...嗯。"

"Huh...you can be really stupid sometimes. Forget it. I'm not mad...and being here should clarify that."  
"哼...你有时真是蠢得可以。算了，我没生气...待在这里应该能说明一切。"

"I suppose thats true." "我想那是真的。"

"Don't expect this to happen again."  
"别指望这种事会再发生。"

"I never even expected it to happen once."  
"我甚至从未期待过它会发生一次。"

"Liar." "骗子。"

"Fine, Fine. I dream about this all the time. Happy?"  
"好吧，好吧。我总是梦到这个。满意了？"

"Not particularly. Now quiet already. If you can't sleep then go on the couch. I don't want you to be tossing and turning only to wake me up."  
"并不特别满意。现在安静点。如果你睡不着就去沙发上。我不想你翻来覆去把我吵醒。"

'Who was the one that woke who up again?' Shinji thought in his head.  
'又是谁把谁叫醒的来着？' 真嗣在心里想着。

"Anyways...night Shinji..."  
"总之...晚安，真嗣..."

"Oh...night." "哦...晚安。"

In the end...he wasn't able to sleep...and passed the rest of the night away listening to his SDAT. Asuka slept the night away in his room, tightly wrapped in Shinji's blankets.  
最终...他无法入睡...整夜都在听着他的 SDAT。明日香在他的房间里沉沉睡去，紧紧裹着真嗣的毯子。

**I had a lot of fun typing this chapter because its been in my head, floating around, since the start of summer. I have a strong hatred for rapists and guys that abuse woman in general. I guess I let my own feelings sorta flow out from Shinji in this chapter. I can honestly say that I could not be unbiased if I was asked to preside as a juror at a rapist trial.  
我打这一章时玩得很开心，因为从夏天开始，它就在我脑海中飘来飘去。我非常憎恨强奸犯和那些虐待女性的男人。我想我在这章中让真嗣流露出了我自己的情感。老实说，如果让我担任强奸案的陪审员，我无法保持公正。**

**P.S. I'm posting this at a Home Depot.  
附：我正在家得宝发布这个。**

### Chapter 10: Reality
**I'd just like to take a brief moment to thank everyone that has an interest in this story. While I enjoy reviews it still blows my mind that over 60+ people receive emails every time I post a new chapter. Not to mention those story stats can get really high. Arigatoo Gozaimasu Minna!  
我想借此短暂时刻感谢所有对这部作品感兴趣的人。虽然我喜欢评论，但每次发布新章节时，有超过 60 人收到电子邮件，这仍然让我感到不可思议。更不用说那些故事统计数据可以变得非常高。非常感谢大家！**

**Anyways much shorter then my last few chapters, only around 6k words. These next chapters are going to be fun to write as some more things about Shinji start to come out in the open. Also I'd figured I'd let everyone that reads this know that I'm splitting my time between this and my Negima story. So I'll right a chapter of this and then right a chapter of Negi and so on and so forth. Not likely that I'll get around to working on this till November now. Anyway enjoy.  
无论如何，这一章比我的前几章短得多，只有大约 6000 字。接下来的几章将会很有趣，因为关于真嗣的一些事情将开始浮出水面。另外，我想让所有读者知道，我正在这部作品和《魔法老师》之间分配时间。所以我会写一章这个，然后写一章《魔法老师》，如此循环。现在不太可能在这之前开始写这个了。总之，请享受阅读。**

Gendo Ikari sat at his desk with a large manilla envelope in front of him. Namely the medical report on Asuka's father which he had received after hearing about the incident. It was early in the morning; a little over five hours since Asuka's father had been admitted to the Nerv hospital, and the artificial light from the Geofront was just starting to lighten up the darkness in Gendo Ikari's office.  
碇源堂坐在他的办公桌前，面前放着一个大号的马尼拉信封。正是关于明日香父亲的医疗报告，他在得知事故后收到的。时间尚早，距离明日香父亲被送进 NERV 医院不过五小时有余，地底都市的人工光线刚刚开始驱散碇源堂办公室内的黑暗。

Looking down again at the envelop he frowned and wondered if he could use this happenstance to his advantage. While he couldn't say that he approved of Asuka's father, he couldn't help but feel that the man had furthered his designs.  
他再次低头看着信封，皱起眉头，思索是否能利用这一偶然事件为自己谋利。虽然他不能说赞同明日香的父亲，但他不禁觉得此人推进了他的计划。

At that moment his friend, Kozo Fuyutsuki stepped into his office.  
就在这时，他的朋友，富士树久走进了他的办公室。

"So? Did anything happen?"  
“所以？有什么事发生吗？”

"...From what Doctor Akagi has sent me, there doesn't seem to be any sign of contamination."  
“……从赤木博士传来的消息来看，似乎没有污染的迹象。”

Kozo let out a sigh of relief. After a slight pause he asked, "How is Seele going to interpret this?"  
惣流松了一口气。稍作停顿后，他问道：“Seele 会如何解读这一点？”

"...They shouldn't have any suspicions. I have made sure of that."  
"...他们不应该有任何疑虑。我已经确保了这一点。"

"...I wonder..." "...我在想..."

"You doubt me?" "你怀疑我？"

"No. Just that based on what Inspector Kaji has reported, it doesn't exist."  
"不，只是根据加治检察官的报告，它并不存在。"

"There was always the possibility of that. The Dead Sea scrolls were written by humans after all, and humans have a habit of making mistakes."  
"这种情况总是有可能的。毕竟死海古卷是由人类书写的，而人类总免不了犯错。"

"Seele might looked into him more."  
"Seele 或许应该对他进行更深入的调查。"

"As I have said I have taken appropriated measures over the years to avoid that. They only look at him and see a disposable pilot."  
"正如我所说，多年来我已采取了适当的措施来避免这种情况。他们只看他一眼，就认为他是个可随意替换的飞行员。"

"Which is valuable to us."  
"这对我们来说很有价值。"

"...Correct." "……没错。"

With a sigh, Kozo left his standing position and walked over to the large windows that barely generated any of the artificial sunlight.  
叹了口气，Kozo 离开了站立的位置，走向那些几乎不产生任何人造阳光的大型窗户。

"...Sometimes I wonder if Yui would approve of what we are doing."  
“……有时候我在想，Yui 会不会赞同我们所做的事情。”

After a slight pause, Gendo said, "Yui wished for the future that we are building. Instrumentality will be complete and people shall change."  
稍作停顿后，Gendo 说道：“Yui 希望我们建设未来。人类补完计划将会完成，人们将会改变。”

"But people don't enjoy change. They prefer things to stay the same so that it doesn't interrupt their daily routine. They become used to normality"  
"但人们不喜欢改变。他们希望事物保持不变，以免打乱他们的日常生活。他们习惯了常态"

"...They wont have a choice in the matter."  
"...他们在这件事上没有选择。"

"...Do you really think Shinji will agree to this though?"  
"...你真的认为真嗣会同意这样做吗？"

"...Eventually he will realize the need for Instrumentality. It is impossible for humans to understand each other any other way."  
"...最终他会意识到实行‘工具化’的必要性。人类不可能通过其他方式相互理解。"

Turning away from the windows, Kozo asked, "What do you plan to do now though? With this latest incident even Shinji must be starting to feel a change in himself."  
转过身来，Kozo 问道：“那么现在你打算怎么办？经历了最近的事件，即使是真嗣也开始感觉到自己内心的变化了吧。”

"...That is true. When Doctor Akagi sent me the medical files related to Asuka's father, she determined that the velocity of Shinji's punch was well above that of a normal humans. She called it abnormal."  
"...确实如此。当赤木博士将有关明日香父亲的医疗文件发给我时，她发现真嗣那一拳的速度远超常人。她称之为异常。"

"...That explains a lot."  
"...这就解释了很多。"

"We will have to start examining his thought patterns. See if there are any differences between his and another humans. We will include them in the synchronization tests. Tell Doctor Akagi that she is to oversee this herself. Let no one else know about it."  
"我们必须开始研究他的思维模式。看看他与普通人类有何不同。我们将把他们纳入同步测试中。告诉赤城博士，她要亲自负责这项工作。不得让其他人知道。"

"Very well." "很好。"

"...One more thing Fuyutsuki..."  
"...还有一件事，冬月副司令..."

"Hmmm?" He said as he turned around.  
"嗯？" 他转过身来说道。

"...Let Doctor Akagi know that we are testing the dummy plugs later."  
"...告诉赤木博士，我们稍后将测试模拟插入栓。"

"Understood." “明白了。”

After Kozo had left the room, Gendo leaned back in his chair and looked at another file that was next to the medical report. Picking it up he leafed through it quickly to the photo he wanted and settled on the picture of Shinji Ikari being held by his mother. No emotion was held in his eyes as he looked down at his so called son.  
在薰离开房间后，源堂靠回椅背，目光转向旁边的一份文件，那是与医疗报告相邻的另一份资料。他拿起文件，迅速翻到想要的照片页，定格在一张真嗣被母亲抱着的画面上。他的眼神中没有流露出任何情感，只是冷冷地俯视着这个所谓的儿子。

---

Shinji wasn't sure if it was the yelling in his ear that had woken him or the pounding headache that he felt, still, both of them felt the same. Squinting his eyes open, he pulled the earbuds out of his ears and rolled over to see Asuka frowning at him while tapping her finger silently against her arm.  
真嗣不确定是耳边的吼声还是那阵剧烈的头痛唤醒了他，但两者给他的感觉如出一辙。他眯着眼睛睁开，拔出耳塞，翻身看到明日香正皱着眉头，手指无声地敲打着自己的手臂。

"Well?" "那么？"

Shinji, not in the mood to be toyed around with her this early in the morning stubbornly said back, "Well what?"  
一大早就被她戏弄，真嗣心情不佳地固执回道：“那又怎样？”

"Are you stupid. Breakfast."  
“你是不是傻，早餐啊。”

"Oh that," Shinji mumbled as he rolled back over.  
“哦，那个啊，”真嗣咕哝着翻了个身。

"Get off the couch already and move. We have school today, remember?"  
"快从沙发上起来，动一动。我们今天还要上学，记得吗？"

"Not today you don't." "今天你不用去了。"

Asuka, and a rather reluctant Shinji both turned to see Misato standing in the doorway of the living room.  
明日香，还有相当不情愿的真嗣，两人都转向客厅门口，看到美里站在那里。

"Why don't we have school?"  
“为什么我们不上学？”

"I got a call early this morning that Ritsuko wants you two and Rei to come in for tests."  
“今天一大早，律子打电话来说要你们俩和丽去进行测试。”

"Uhhhhh." “呃……”

"Come on its not that bad Asuka."  
"来吧，明日香，没那么糟糕。"

"Its not that I'm mad about not going to school...but...because of last night."  
"不是因为不能去学校生气...而是...因为昨晚的事。"

"...I tried explaining that to Ritsuko but she said that the order came directly from commander Ikari. So no exceptions."  
"...我试图向律子解释，但她说是碇司令直接下的命令。所以没有例外。"

"Fine, fine. I got it."  
"好了，好了。我明白了。"

Turning back to Shinji, she said, "Here that? No school. Should be glad."  
她转回身对真嗣说：“听到了吗？不用上学。应该高兴才对。”

"Yes I'm grateful that instead of sitting in a stuffy classroom I get to sit in a twenty foot capsule that smells like blood."  
“是的，我很感激不用坐在闷热的教室里，而是坐在一个二十英尺长、充满血腥味的驾驶舱里。”

"...Don't have to get so upset about it."  
"...没必要为此这么生气。"

"Fine, I'm getting up." "好吧，我起床了。"

"Good. I'm hungry." "好。我饿了。"

"So I've heard." "我听说了。"

Falling off the couch, Shinji was surprised when Asuka put out a helping hand to him. Excepting it somewhat hesitantly, he stood up slowly with his hand in Asuka's. It was then that he remembered last night and how he had ended up on the couch. Though it was his decision in the first place. Glancing at Asuka he realized that he was now standing and let go of her hand quickly.  
从沙发上摔下来，真嗣惊讶地看到明日香伸出手来帮他。他有些犹豫地接受了她的帮助，慢慢地站了起来，手还握在明日香的手中。这时，他想起了昨晚自己是如何最终躺在沙发上的。虽然这原本是他的决定。他瞥了一眼明日香，意识到自己已经站起来了，便迅速放开了她的手。

"...What's up? You've got a pained expression on your face."  
"...怎么了？你脸上带着痛苦的表情。"

"...Huh?" "...啊？"

"Yeah, you look like you don't feel too good."  
"是啊，你看起来不太舒服。"

Doing something completely un-Asuka like, she reached up and held her hand against his forehead.  
她做出了一件完全不像明日香会做的事，伸出手来，将手掌贴在他的额头上。

"A-Asuka wh-what are you?"  
"A-明日香，你...你是什么人？"

While having her left hand against Shinji's forehead she put her right hand against her own, checking if there was a difference in temperature.  
她用左手贴在真嗣的额头上，同时用右手贴着自己的额头，检查是否有温差。

"...Well you don't seem to have a fever."  
"...嗯，看来你没有发烧。"

"Of course I don't! I just have a minor headache is all."  
"当然不严重！我只是有点轻微的头疼罢了。"

"Baka. Learn to take better care of yourself."  
"笨蛋。学会更好地照顾自己吧。"

'How can I when I've been stuck taking care of you ever since you got here?'  
“我怎么可能学会呢？自从你来了之后，我就一直被困在照顾你这件事上。”

As Asuka brought her hand back against Shinji's forehead, Shinji happened to steal a glance at Misato and noticed that she had an eyebrow raised and looked like she was about to explode with laughter.  
当明日香将手从真嗣的额头上收回时，真嗣恰好瞥了一眼美里，注意到她挑起了一边的眉毛，看起来马上就要爆笑出声。

"What?" He finally managed to say to her.  
“什么？”他终于对她开口道。

"...You guys looked like a couple just now."  
“……你们刚才看起来真像一对情侣。”

"..."

"Absolutely not!" “绝对不行！”

Only Shinji happened to say this.  
只有真嗣碰巧说了这句话。

Upon realizing that Asuka hadn't said anything, Shinji spun around and faced her. Asuka was looking straight at Misato and was frowning slightly as though wondering what she wanted to say.  
意识到明日香什么也没说，真嗣转过身面对她。明日香直视着美里，微微皱眉，似乎在想她想说什么。

"...I think Shinji's more of a servant actually."  
"...我觉得真嗣其实更像是个仆人。"

Shinji seemed to deflate on the spot. Really, what had he expected? Though it seemed Asuka noticed this sudden change in demeanor and said, "What? Did you think that I'd want you as a boyfriend. As if! That wont even happen in your dreams."  
真嗣似乎当场就泄了气。真的，他还能期待什么呢？不过，似乎明日香注意到了他突然改变的态度，说道：“什么？你以为我会想让你做男朋友。做梦去吧！那种事连你的梦里都不会发生。”

Shinji wasn't able to stop himself and said, "Then what was last night all about!"  
真嗣控制不住自己，说道：“那昨晚又是怎么回事！”

"Sleepwalking," she said simply.  
"梦游，"她简单地说道。

"Sleepwalking? You think everything that happened last night was because of sleep walking!"  
"梦游？你觉得昨晚发生的一切都是因为梦游！"

"Why else would I wake up and find myself in your room?"  
"不然我怎么会醒来时发现自己在你房间里？"

"You're unbelievable!" "你真是不可理喻！"

"You're a pervert!" "你这个变态！"

"We all are going to be in trouble if we don't hurry down to Nerv, right now," murmured Misato while secretly wondering what had happened last night. Her imagination was going overboard.  
"如果我们不赶紧去 Nerv，我们都会遇到麻烦的，""美里低声说道，同时暗自思索昨晚发生了什么。她的想象力已经失控了。"

"...Ah shit." "...该死。"

Hurrying out of the living room, Asuka quickly threw some makeshift clothes on and waited by the door.  
急匆匆地离开客厅，明日香迅速套上几件临时衣物，站在门口等待。

"Hurry it up baka." "快点，笨蛋。"

Hobbling out of his room on one foot, Shinji managed to say back. "Yeah fine. I'm ready."  
单脚跳着走出房间，真嗣勉强回了一句。“嗯，没事。我准备好了。”

Nodding, Asuka opened the door and walked out into he open air.  
点头示意后，明日香打开门，走进了开阔的空气中。

---

No matter how many times he dawned the plug suit, Shinji could never really get quite used to it. Maybe he was just anxious, though with good reason. He had heard beforehand that his father would be specifically supervising this test, and it made him a little uncomfortable. Why would his father choose now of all times to witness a synchronization test? He had never witnessed it any other times.  
无论穿多少次插入栓服，真嗣始终无法完全适应。也许他只是有些紧张，尽管有充分的理由。他事先听说父亲会专门监督这次测试，这让他有些不安。为什么父亲会选择在这个时候来观看同步测试？他以前从未在其他时候见证过。

As Shinji climbed into Unit 01's entry plug he caught a brief glimpse of his father looking at the three Eva's stationed next to each other. A grimace passed over Shinji's face for a brief instance before he ignored it. His father had become an irrelevant object in his life, one that he could readily do without. Sometimes he wondered what was making him pilot Eva. He had no good reason after all.  
当真嗣爬进初号机的插入栓时，他瞥见父亲正注视着并排站立的三台 EVA。真嗣的脸上掠过一丝苦笑，但很快便置之不理。父亲在他的生活中已变得无关紧要，是他可以轻易舍弃的存在。有时他会想，究竟是什么驱使他驾驶 EVA。毕竟，他并没有什么充分的理由。

'Well...maybe thats not entirely correct,' thought Shinji as he glanced over at Asuka who was climbing the ladder to her entry plug. He supposed that he just wanted to protect everybody that was important to him, and Asuka certainly fell into the category.  
“嗯……也许这并不完全正确，”真嗣想着，目光转向正在攀爬梯子进入插入栓的明日香。他想，他只是想保护所有对他重要的人，而明日香无疑属于这一类。

"Okay you three, we're gonna start the test. Just perform like you usually do," said Misato from the control room.  
“好了，你们三个，我们即将开始测试。就像平常那样表现，”从控制室传来美里的话。

"This time you better take us out for dinner," mumbled Asuka.  
"这次你最好带我们出去吃晚饭，"明日香咕哝道。

"Why bother, Shinji's cooking tastes better then anything I could pay for anyway."  
"何必呢，真嗣做的饭比我能花钱买到的任何东西都好吃。"

Asuka was silent at Misato's words. She didn't want to have to admit it, even though she was likely right.  
明日香在美里的话中沉默了。她不想承认这一点，尽管美里很可能是对的。

"Starting the three Eva's...now," said Ritsuko from the other side of the control room.  
“启动三台 EVA……现在。”赤木律子在控制室的另一端说道。

Shinji felt a familiar sensation of rushing down a tunnel at one hundred miles and hour, only to come out in the bright, open sun. Letting himself become relaxed, he closed his eyes and tried to concentrate. Which was increasingly hard as his headache was starting to throb again.  
真嗣感受到一种熟悉的穿梭隧道般的感觉，以每小时一百英里的速度疾驰，最终冲出隧道，沐浴在明媚的阳光下。他让自己放松下来，闭上眼睛，试图集中精神。但随着头痛再次开始跳动，这变得越来越困难。

Up in the control room Ritsuko was monitoring the three pilots closely, though she was monitoring one of them a lot more than the others.  
在控制室里，赤木律子正密切监视着三位驾驶员，尽管她对其中一位的关注远超其他人。

"Any change in heart rate? Brain waves? Breathing?"  
"心率有变化吗？脑电波？呼吸呢？"

"Negative ma'am. ...Wait. Pilot 01's brain waves are slightly shifting."  
"没有变化，女士。...等等。01 号飞行员的脑电波有轻微波动。"

"Is it controllable?" "能控制住吗？"

"At this infrequency its nothing to worry about."  
"在这种频率下，没什么好担心的。"

"Hmmm. Okay watch it closely and let me know if anything happens."  
"嗯，好吧，密切观察，有任何情况就告诉我。"

"Hai." "嗨。"

As Ritsuko turned away from the monitor to look out of the clear glass that acted as a barrier incase an Eva went out of control, and a mirror so the research could be given a clear picture, she wondered if the commanders instructions were groundless or if there was something else behind his words. She had always known after all that he was gifted with keeping secrets.  
当律子从监视器前转身，望向那块透明玻璃——既是防止 EVA 失控的屏障，也是让研究者能清晰观察的镜子——她不禁思索，指挥官的指示是无的放矢，还是背后另有隐情。毕竟，她一直知道他擅长保守秘密。

Back inside the entry plug Shinji's headache was starting to increase in pain, but he attempted to push it to the back of him mind. Though it felt like the source of the headache was his mind.  
回到插入栓内，真嗣的头痛开始加剧，但他试图将其抛诸脑后。尽管头痛的源头似乎来自他的内心。

'_Looks like somethings has changed with you.'_  
'看来你有些变化了。'

Shinji heard the familiar voice resounding all around him and had to bite his tongue so as not to start yelling.  
真嗣听到那熟悉的声音在四周回响，不得不咬紧舌头以免开始大喊。

'If you don't mind I'm having a tough time concentrating, and you're making it all the more difficult.'  
'如果你不介意的话，我正难以集中注意力，而你让这变得更困难了。'

'_I've got nothing to do with that headache of yours. Thats because you acted out simply in anger.'_  
'你的头痛可跟我没关系。那是因为你只是出于愤怒而发作。'

'What are you tal-' '你在说什么——'

'_That girls father, what you did to him.'_  
'那个女孩的父亲，你对他的所作所为。'

'What the hell does that have to do with my headaches? And why do you even know about that?'  
'这跟我头痛有什么关系？你又是怎么知道的？'

'_Its not like you were keeping your thoughts hidden or anything. Its like a constant screaming in your head of what happened.'_  
'你又没刻意隐藏自己的想法，脑子里一直在尖叫着那些事。'

'Stop damn it!' '停下，该死的！'

Silence for a moment, and then.  
沉默了一会儿，然后。

'_Whats wrong? Starting to question some stuff about yourself? That punch could have rivaled a boxers. Bit unusual for a scrawny fifteen year old kid to incapacitate a full grown man.'_  
'怎么了？开始质疑自己了吗？那一拳的力道简直能媲美拳击手。对一个瘦弱的十五岁孩子来说，能打倒一个成年男子，确实有点不寻常。'

'Shut the fuck up damn it!'  
'闭嘴，该死的！'

'_You should really control that temper. Next time you lash out in anger you just might end of up hurting somebody important to you.'_  
'你真该控制一下你的脾气。下次你再这样愤怒地爆发，可能会伤到对你重要的人。'

'Shut the fuck up!' '闭嘴！'

'_Be a tragedy to see that red head of yours loose a few of her limbs because you were so stupid and couldn't control your emotions.'_  
“看到你那头红发因为你的愚蠢和无法控制情绪而失去几条肢体，真是悲剧。”

"I TOLD YOU TO SHUT THE FUCK UP!"  
“我告诉过你他妈的闭嘴！”

Shinji yelled this directly inside of the entry plug and at the same time several things happened.  
真嗣在插入栓内直接大喊，与此同时，几件事情同时发生了。

Shinji's voice was projected directly into the control room where Misato, Ritsuko, and the others were and it came out shrill and high over the intercom. It sounded like he was screaming a war cry of some sort.  
真嗣的声音直接传入了控制室，那里有美里、律子和其他人，通过对讲机传出的声音尖锐而高亢。听起来他像是在发出某种战斗的呐喊。

Immediately Misato was at the intercom and started yelling back to Shinji what was wrong. Though all she got was a jumbled string of words tied together that she was unable to decipher.  
美里立刻冲到对讲机前，开始大声询问真嗣发生了什么事。然而她只听到一串混乱的词语交织在一起，无法理解。

Ritsuko on the other hand had rushed over to the synchronization monitors and swore loudly as she saw that his brain waves were jumping around frantically. Soon the wave lengths between Shinji and Unit 01 started to part and all but ceased. Unit 01 and Shinji's synchronization abruptly halted.  
另一方面，律子则迅速冲向同步监测器，看到他的脑波疯狂跳动时大声咒骂。很快，真嗣与初号机之间的波长开始分离，几乎完全停止。真嗣与初号机的同步突然中断了。

"Get him out of their now! Seal off Unit's 00 and 02 from 01 incase it goes berserk."  
“立刻把他弄出去！将 00 和 02 号单元与 01 号隔离，以防它发狂。”

Immediately at Misato words the same glass like barrier that separated the control room from the Eva's split down the middle of the floor, enclosing Unit 01 in its own small area.  
随着美里的话音落下，原本将控制室与 EVA 分隔开的玻璃般屏障沿着地板中央裂开，将 01 号单元封闭在其独立的小区域内。

"Deactivated Unit 01! Disconnect the umbilical cord, revert all available power to life support systems and send the code to eject the entry plug! Do it manually if you have to."  
“已停用 01 号单元！断开脐带电缆，将所有可用电力转至生命维持系统，并发送弹出插入栓的指令！必要时手动操作。”

"Umbilical cord removed successfully, but either Unit 01 or its pilot is rejecting the signal."  
"脐带电缆已成功移除，但无论是初号机还是其驾驶员，都在拒绝信号。"

"Then have somebody get down there and remove the plug manually!"  
"那就派人下去手动拔掉插头！"

"Wait a moment..." "稍等一下……"

Misato spun around and was surprised to see that Gendo had spoken.  
美里转过身，惊讶地发现源堂已经开口说话了。

"Commander?" “指挥官？”

"Wait for a minute to remove the entry plug."  
“稍等一会儿再取出插入栓。”

"...If I may ask...why?" “……如果可以问的话……为什么？”

"...An experiment. Keep a contingency crew prepared though. If Unit 01 goes berserk you have my permission to restrain it by any means. Make the rescue of the Eva the top priority, pilot second."  
"...一项实验。尽管如此，还是要准备好应急人员。如果零号机发狂，我授权你们可以采取任何手段进行限制。救援 Eva 是首要任务，驾驶员其次。"

Misato didn't like what he had ment with experiment, but she couldn't very well say no.  
Misato 不喜欢他所说的实验含义，但她也不能拒绝。

"...Okay...we wait for a minute or so then retrieve the pilot. Ritsuko?"  
"...好的...我们等上一分钟左右，然后救出驾驶员。律子？"

"Unit 01 has rejected all signals. Life of pilot is unknown at the moment. Unable to get a proper reading on anything."  
"初号机已拒绝所有信号。驾驶员生命状态目前未知。无法获取任何准确读数。"

"...I figured as much. Then we wait."  
"...我早有预料。那么，我们只能等待。"

---

'Where am I?' '我在哪儿？'

'_We're you should be.'_ '我们该去的地方。'

'Where is that?' '那是什么地方？'

'_Look around yourself and find out.'_  
'环顾四周，自己找出来。'

And so Shinji did what the faceless entity in front of him told him what to do.  
于是，真嗣按照面前这位无面实体的指示去做了。

It was the world...yet it wasn't. It was a world that was empty, non-existent so to speak. Because nothing existed anymore.  
这是世界...却又不是。这是一个空无一物、可以说是不存在的世界。因为一切都不复存在了。

Shinji looked around at the wasteland that he was standing on. Was this Earth in some bleak future where the angels have destroyed it?  
真嗣环顾四周，他所站立的这片荒原。这是否是地球在某个黯淡未来，被使徒毁灭后的景象？

He looked down at the ground he was standing on and was shocked to see a white sandy substance around him. Then, looking up, he saw blue sky with a cloud in sight. Whats more, there didn't seem to be anything like a sun in the sky. Why was everything so bright then?  
他低头看向脚下的地面，惊讶地发现周围是白色的沙状物质。接着，抬头望去，他看到了蓝天和一朵云。更重要的是，天空中似乎没有太阳。那为何一切又如此明亮？

Kneeling down he grasped a handful of the sandy substance and let it flow through his open hand. It really did seem like sand.  
他跪下来，抓起一把沙状物质，让它从张开的手掌中流过。这确实看起来像沙子。

'_That is not sand, as you just wondered. But the remains of the four hundred billions creatures that used to live on this planet.'_  
'那不是沙子，正如你刚才所疑惑的。而是曾经生活在这个星球上的四千亿生物的遗骸。'

'But what is this planet?'  
'但这个星球是什么？'

'_The name...I suppose you Lilim call it Earth. Its known as something much more tranquil though in our knowledge.'_  
'这个名字...我想你们莉莉姆称之为地球。但在我们的认知中，它有着更为宁静的称谓。'

'Your knowledge?' '你们的知识？'

'_Correct... I am an angel.'_  
'没错...我是一名天使。'

Normally Shinji would have frozen immediately, but this strange formless shape didn't seem to have any harm in itself.  
通常情况下，真嗣会立刻僵住，但这个奇怪的无形形态似乎本身并无害处。

'So what am I doing here?'  
“那么，我在这里做什么呢？”

'_First do you know who you are?'_  
“首先，你知道自己是谁吗？”

Shinji thought for a moment and realized that he didn't know what his name was. Shaking his head for a second he frowned at the white shape in front of him. It was then that he realized that the only residual thing he noticed that look at all like a living being was a lopsided mouth that hung at what would be considered a head.  
真嗣思索片刻，意识到自己并不知道它的名字。他摇了摇头，对着眼前白色的形状皱起眉头。这时他才注意到，唯一看起来像活物的东西是一个歪斜的嘴巴，挂在应该是头部的位置。

'_Well, I suppose you wouldn't know what your name is. Since you don't have one.'_  
'嗯，我想你不知道自己的名字，因为你没有名字。'

'What about you?' '那你呢？'

'_My name? Unimportant currently. I'm more interested in yourself. How did you come to be, for you certainly share common characteristics to angels'_  
'我的名字？眼下无关紧要。我更感兴趣的是你。你是如何成为这样的，因为你确实有着天使的共同特征。'

'What do you mean?' '你是什么意思？'

'_I don't know myself. You certainly are human, but something about you...'_  
'我不了解自己。你无疑是人类，但关于你...'

Shinji was silent for a minute as he didn't know how to respond to this. Finally shaking the discomfort off he glanced around at his surroundings again and said, 'What are you doing here?'  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，因为他不知道该如何回应。最终，他甩开不适感，再次环顾四周，问道：'你在这里做什么？'

'_Hmmm? I was waiting for my time to come. I believe it should be soon. My brothers, while powerful shall not survive. I'm supposed to pave the way for the next generation of angels after all.'_  
'嗯？我在等待我的时机到来。我相信应该很快了。我的兄弟们虽然强大，但不会幸存。毕竟，我应该为下一代天使铺平道路。'

'You said this was Earth...'  
'你说过这是地球...'

'_It is Earth as we know it. Much different from the lush, green one that the Lilim come from.'_  
'这是我们所知的地球。与莉莉姆们来自的那片葱郁绿意之地大相径庭。'

'Lilim?' '莉莉姆？'

'_Humans...that is what you call yourself. He originally named you Lilim and that is what we have called you.'_  
'人类……那是你们对自己的称呼。他最初称你们为莉莉姆，这也是我们一直以来的叫法。'

'...I don't even know how I got here, or what my name is.'  
'...我甚至不知道我是怎么来到这里的，或者我的名字是什么。'

'_Well, on that account your name would be Ikari Shinji. Though that is your name given by the Lilim. I had forgotten that the Lilim have changed there ways since they first rose out of the ground those many years ago.'_  
'那么，基于这一点，你的名字应该是碇真嗣。虽然这是人类给你的名字。我忘了人类自从许多年前从地下崛起以来，他们的方式已经改变了。'

Shinji was silent for a moment before he asked something that had been bothering him. 'How old are you?'  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，然后问了一个一直困扰他的问题。'你多大了？'

'_My age? I have lost count of that nearly a millennium ago. Though I am one of the oldest beings alive in the universe. Of course, angels do not keep track of there age as humans do, because angels are fundamentally immortal.'_  
'我的年龄？近千年前我就已经记不清了。虽然我是宇宙中存活最久的生物之一。当然，天使不像人类那样记录自己的年龄，因为天使本质上是不朽的。'

'Fundamentally?' '本质上？'

'_Only an angel can kill an angel.'_  
'只有天使能杀死天使。'

'You say that I'm like you. In what way?'  
'你说我像你。在哪方面？'

'_...As I said it is difficult to discern about you because I have never met a human that has the aura of an angel about them.'_  
'...正如我所说，很难判断你，因为我从未遇到过像你这样带有天使气息的人类。'

'Aura?' '气息？'

'_An AT-field so to speak. Of course all humans have an AT-field with some substance, some more than others I suppose. But yours is different. It feels like an angels.'_  
“可以说是 AT 力场。当然，所有人类都有一定程度的 AT 力场，有些人可能比其他人更强。但你的不同。它感觉像是天使的。”

'...This makes no sense. How come I have this...'  
“……这说不通。我怎么会有这种……”

'_I'm not sure. For someone as me who thought that knowledge was a fabrication of this world, I must say it makes me think as I have not thought in sometime.'_  
“我不确定。对于像我这样曾经认为知识是这个世界虚构的人来说，这让我思考起一些久未触及的问题。”

'...Glad I could help. I think.'  
'...很高兴能帮上忙。我想。'

'_Everything comes to an end, even knowledge. Because knowledge is impossible to gain unless things exist. Take this world for instance. If you look up, you see blue sky. If you look down, you see what life has turned into after many years. If you would walk further along this line of sand, you would see never ending miles of it. Nothing. There is nothing here. And so, knowledge does not exist.'_  
'万物皆有终结，知识亦然。因为若非事物存在，知识无从获得。以这个世界为例。抬头望，你见蓝天。低头看，你见多年后生命所化之物。若你沿着这条沙线继续前行，你将看到无尽的沙海。空无一物。这里什么都没有。因此，知识并不存在。'

'_..._But you still retain the knowledge you have gathered.'  
'...但你仍保留着你所积累的知识。'

'_True, but with the passage of time, things start to slip away. The Lilim are so redundant that I stopped caring for them after the first few years of there existence. They are an eye sore now.'_  
“确实，但随着时间的流逝，事物开始逐渐消逝。莉莉姆们如此多余，以至于在她们存在的最初几年后，我便不再关心她们了。现在她们只是碍眼的存在。”

'So if I'm a Lilim what are you supposed to do with me?'  
“那么，如果我是莉莉姆，你打算怎么处置我？”

The white, shapeless object was silent for a moment as it pondered Shinji's question. Eventually it said, '_You seem to be something that is not wholesomely here. Your mind is wandering while your body lies else where. Your mind is wandering in front of me. If I were to destroy it, your body would become a useless pile of flesh. Harsh, but true. I look at you and think, what should I do regarding the fact that you are both angel and human? I cant judge this situation with out asking for his help. I'll let you go.'_  
那个白色、无定形的物体沉默了一会儿，思考着真嗣的问题。最终它说道：“你似乎是一种不完全存在于此的东西。你的心灵在游荡，而你的身体却躺在别处。你的心灵在我面前徘徊。如果我摧毁它，你的身体将变成一堆无用的肉块。虽然残酷，但这是事实。我看着你，思考着，面对你既是天使又是人类的事实，我该怎么做？没有他的帮助，我无法判断这个情况。我会放你走。”

Shinji realized that he had been involuntarily holding his breath in and just released it.  
真嗣意识到自己一直在不由自主地屏住呼吸，这才松了一口气。

'How much of this will I retain?'  
“我能记住多少呢？”

'_Good question. My guess is that you were brought here against your own will. I don't know how that would have happened though. You should not remember any of this. I think it would hinder more than anything.'_  
“好问题。我猜你是被迫来到这里的。虽然我不知道这是怎么发生的。按理说你不应该记得这些。我想这只会妨碍更多。”

'Well, I suppose I should thank you for everything that you've told me, whether or not I remember it.'  
'嗯，我想我应该感谢你告诉我的一切，无论我是否记得。'

'_Don't let yourself worry about it. I can only hope that I'm able to meet you sometime again, in a peaceful way such as this.'_  
'别为此担心。我只希望将来某一天能以这样和平的方式再次与你相遇。'

'_..._One last thing, how exactly am I supposed to get back?'  
'...还有最后一件事，我究竟该怎么回去？'

'_Thats an easy one.'_ '那是个简单的问题。'

Shinji opened his mouth to ask what was easy about it when he felt something hook on the back of his navel and drag him backwards. Looking up just in time before he was thrown back into his body he thought he saw a sad smile appear on the shapes face.  
真嗣张口想问这有什么简单的，却感到肚脐后有什么东西钩住了他，将他向后拖去。在被抛回自己身体之前的一瞬，他觉得自己看到那东西的脸上浮现出一丝悲伤的微笑。

'_Though I suppose...that my wishful thinking of a peaceful conversation will come to nothing in the end. Ikari Shinji-kun.'_  
'不过我想……我那和平对话的愿望最终还是会落空吧。碇真嗣君。'

Shinji heard no more.  真嗣再也没听到任何声音。

---

White. Why is it always white?  
白色。为什么总是白色？

As Shinji blinked open his eyes he wondered how many days he had been out. The clock in his body felt completely wrong.  
当真嗣眨开眼睛时，他不知道自己已经昏迷了多少天。他体内的生物钟感觉完全错乱了。

Sitting up he had to wonder if he had spent more time in this room then at Misato's place, but quickly pushed that silly thought away.  
坐起身来，他不禁疑惑自己在这个房间待的时间是否比在美里小姐那儿还多，但很快就把这个愚蠢的念头抛开了。

Looking to his left he was unsurprised that several chairs had been positioned around his bed. But blinking several times he was surprised that he had missed what was so obvious. Two of the chairs were occupied. One was sleeping with their head resting on the end of his bed while the other was calmly cutting an apple in six equal parts. Shinji thought that Asuka and Rei were the most unlikely pair to be seated at his side.  
向左看去，他并不意外地发现几把椅子围在他的床边。但眨了几下眼后，他惊讶地发现自己竟然忽略了如此明显的事实。两把椅子上有人。一个正枕着他的床尾睡着，而另一个则平静地将一个苹果切成六等份。真嗣觉得，明日香和丽是最不可能坐在他身边的两个人。

As though Rei had heard Shinji's thoughts, she looked up briefly during which something tugged at the corners of her mouth. It might have been something akin to a smile.  
仿佛听到了真嗣的心声，丽抬头瞥了一眼，嘴角微微牵动，那或许是一种近似微笑的表情。

"Are you feeling better Ikari-kun?"  
"碇君，感觉好些了吗？"

"...I guess so. I mean...I don't even know what happened."  
"...应该是吧。我的意思是...我甚至不知道发生了什么。"

"Unit 01 went berserk while you were in it."  
"你在里面的时候，初号机暴走了。"

"...I figured it be something like that. What day is it anyway?"  
"...我就猜到会是这样。话说回来，今天是几号？"

"Its the same day as the test, though several hours afterwards."  
"就是考试的那天，不过已经是几个小时之后了。"

It was then that Shinji realized that no light was coming from outside the large windows in the room. The artificial light in the Geofront had long since dissipated leaving behind a solid darkness.  
就在这时，真嗣意识到房间里的大窗户没有透进一丝光线。地底都市的人工照明早已熄灭，留下了一片漆黑。

As Shinji continued to look out the darkened windows he heard a small, "Here," and looked around to see the plate of apples cut neatly in front of him.  
当真嗣继续凝视着昏暗的窗外时，他听到一声轻微的，“给，”随即环顾四周，发现一盘整齐切好的苹果摆在了他面前。

Looking at Rei wordlessly he took two of them and popped them into his mouth. It was then that he realized how hungry he had been.  
他无声地看着绫波，拿起两片苹果塞进嘴里。这时他才意识到自己有多饿。

"These are good Ayanami."  
“这些苹果很好吃，绫波。”

"...Ariga-too." "...有贺-图。"

Shinji swallowed hard and glanced back at her. He had never heard Rei say words of thanks before and apparently she had never said it before either as a puzzled expression was on her face. Smiling slightly back at her he decided it was about time to wake someone. If not the smell of the apples was sure to wake her eventually.  
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，回头看了看她。他从未听过绫波说感谢的话，显然她自己也从未说过，因为她脸上带着困惑的表情。他微微对她笑了笑，决定是时候叫醒某个人了。如果再不叫醒她，苹果的香味肯定会把她唤醒。

Crawling to the end of his bed he frowned down at Asuka. Her hair was a disheveled mess and the skirt and shirt she was wearing was crumpled and frayed at the edges.  
他爬到床尾，皱着眉头看着明日香。她的头发凌乱不堪，裙子和衬衫皱巴巴的，边缘也磨损了。

Unsure of how to proceed he ended up lightly tapping the side of her cheek with the back of his hand. This was unwise and next moment she shot upwards, smashing the top of her head into Shinji's chin and sending him reeling backwards.  
不确定如何继续，他最终轻轻地用手指背面轻拍了她的脸颊。这一举动不明智，下一刻她猛地坐起，头顶撞上了真嗣的下巴，让他向后踉跄了几步。

"Baka!" "笨蛋！"

'First thing up and she already calls me an idiot,' thought Shinji gloomily as he landed on the floor.  
‘刚醒来就叫我白痴，’真嗣沮丧地想着，摔倒在地板上。

As Asuka blinked her eyes open wearily, as though she didn't know where she was, she immediately looked to the bed she was resting on, only to find out that it was empty.  
当明日香疲惫地睁开眼睛，仿佛不知道自己在哪里，她立刻看向她躺着的床，却发现床上空无一人。

"Shin-" "真-

"Here," said Shinji as he pulled himself back onto the bed and into a sitting position.  
"过来，" 真嗣说着，重新爬回床上，坐直了身子。

Shinji wouldn't have been at all surprised if Asuka had tackled him there and started pounding the shit out of him. Instead she look confusedly back at him before crawling up on the bed and sat directly in front of him.  
如果明日香当时扑向他，开始狠狠揍他一顿，真嗣一点也不会感到惊讶。相反，她困惑地回头看了他一眼，然后爬上床，直接坐在他面前。

"Asuka what are you-" “明日香，你在干什么——”

Whack! 啪！

Asuka smacked him with all her strength against the side of his head, sending him crashing against the bed frame and thankfully, the pillow which absorbed some of the impact.  
明日香用尽全力朝他头侧一拍，让他猛地撞上了床架，幸好有枕头缓冲，减轻了些许冲击。

Rubbing the side of his cheek he angrily yelled back, "Damn it Asuka! What the hell was that-"  
他揉着脸颊，愤怒地吼回去：“该死的明日香！你到底在搞什么鬼——”

Asuka grabbed the front of his shirt and dragged him in front of her so that their noses were a mere centimeter apart. Throughout all this Rei didn't move a muscle. Maybe she could understand Asuka's rage, even if only a little.  
明日香抓住他的衬衫前襟，将他拽到面前，两人的鼻尖仅相距一厘米。整个过程中，绫波零一动不动。或许她能理解明日香的愤怒，哪怕只是一点点。

"You idiot! Do you have any idea how worried everyone was! All that screaming and shouting...I..everyone thought that you were dying!"  
“你这个白痴！你知道大家有多担心吗！那些尖叫和喊声……我……大家都以为你要死了！”

"...What are you talking-"  
"...你在说什么-"

"You! You went crazy inside of your Eva. Trying to destroy every damn thing in sight! You almost killed several people."  
"你！你在 Eva 里发疯了。试图摧毁视线中的一切！你差点杀了好几个人。"

"...I did what?" "...我做了什么？"

"...You...don't remember?"  
"...你...不记得了？"

"Everything is such a blur that I can barely remember even entering the entry plug."  
"一切都模糊不清，我几乎连进入驾驶舱的记忆都没有。"

Asuka looked blankly back at Shinji for a moment before turning towards Rei. If some far corner of her mind thought that Rei was going to help her, she was sorely mistaken. Rei continued sitting there with the same blank expression on her face that she had been wearing for the past few minutes.  
绫波零茫然地看了真嗣一会儿，然后转向丽。如果她内心深处曾以为丽会帮助她，那她大错特错了。丽继续坐在那里，脸上保持着几分钟以来一直未变的空白表情。

Starting to talk more slowly, as though Shinji had some learning disability, Asuka started talking about what happened after Shinji had mentally blacked out.  
开始放慢语速，仿佛真嗣有学习障碍似的，明日香开始讲述真嗣精神崩溃后发生的事情。

"Nobody knows how it happened in the first place, but the commander gave the order for us to wait and see if anything changed."  
“起初没人知道是怎么回事，但司令下令让我们静观其变，看看是否会有什么变化。”

Shinji frowned, he should have guessed that this had something to do with his father.  
真嗣皱起眉头，他本该猜到这与他父亲脱不了关系。

"I don't know how long I was stuck sitting in that entry plug, but I heard a loud shriek come over the intercom. It was you...but it wasn't you. I mean it was your voice, but...I don't know just something sounded strange about your voice. Sorry if I can't explain it any better than that."  
"我不知道自己在插入栓里坐了多久，但突然听到对讲机里传来一声尖叫。那是你...但又不是你。我是说，那是你的声音，但...就是感觉有些奇怪。抱歉，我无法更好地解释了。"

"Anyway, while you were screaming the Eva awoke by itself, with the umbilical cord unattached. Ritsuko later said that you and the Eva weren't even close to having a high enough sync ratio to control the Eva. It awoke by itself I guess and acted of its own accord."  
"不管怎样，当你尖叫时，EVA 自行启动了，脐带电缆并未连接。律子后来告诉我，你和 EVA 的同步率远未达到控制它的水平。我想它是自行觉醒并自主行动的。"

"It broke free of the restraints that was holding it in place, but the odd thing was that it used an AT-field and severed the metallic braces that were attached to it. Afterwards it started going berserk and tried to break the glass barrier. Several times it tried to destroy it with an AT-field."  
"它挣脱了固定它的束缚，奇怪的是，它使用了 AT 力场切断了连接在它身上的金属支架。之后，它开始发狂，试图打破玻璃屏障。多次尝试用 AT 力场摧毁它。"

"...What-" "...什么-"

"Yeah...I thought that I pilot had to concentrate on the generation of an AT-field. After that didn't work though it started pounding on the glass with its arms. I don't think I noticed until later, but your screams intensified then."  
"是的...我以为驾驶员必须专注于 AT 力场的生成。但后来那东西开始用胳膊猛击玻璃。我想我是后来才注意到，但那时你的尖叫声加剧了。"

"What do you mean you noticed later?"  
"你说的后来注意到是什么意思？"

Asuka was silent for a moment before she said, "...Look at your arms."  
明日香沉默了一会儿，然后说道：“……看看你的手臂。”

Shinji did as he was told and looked at both his arms. They were heavily wrapped in bandages.  
真嗣照做了，看向自己的双臂。它们被厚厚的绷带紧紧包裹着。

"What happ-" “发生了什——”

"Ritsuko said that its an anomaly that can occur sometimes, but she said its only supposed to happen if there is a strong sync between the pilot and the Eva. Furthermore it was a rare case. Injury's to the pilots aren't unheard of but yours were different she said.  
律子说这是一种有时会出现的异常现象，但她表示只有在驾驶员与 Eva 之间存在强烈同步的情况下才会发生。而且这是一个罕见的情况。驾驶员受伤并不罕见，但你的情况不同，她这么说。

"How so?" "此话怎讲？"

"...She didn't really say and I didn't press her. I didn't care that much myself."  
……她没具体说，我也没追问。我自己也没那么在意。

Shinji was silent for a minute as he wondered what could possibly be underneath his bandages and was tempted to unwrap them, but Asuka would surely yell at him. Deciding on another course of action, he asked, "What happened after that? Did the Eva stop...or something."  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，他好奇绷带下到底是什么，甚至想解开它们，但明日香肯定会对他大吼大叫。于是他决定换个问题，问道：“那之后发生了什么？Eva 停下了……还是怎么了？”

"Yeah, except, nobody knows why or how, but it suddenly stopped responding and just stood there while leaning against the glass barrier."  
“是啊，只不过，没人知道原因和方式，但它突然就不再回应，只是靠在玻璃屏障上站着。”

"...You said that I almost killed several people, but I don't see how-"  
“……你说我差点害死了几个人，但我看不出怎么回事——”

"...I think that was the part that worried everyone the most. After the commander gave the order to recover the Eva and yourself. Well...when they retrieved the entry plug, you weren't cooperating. That was probably the hardest part. When they managed to get you out you started going into a frenzy, trying to strangle anybody that got near you, all the time screaming. You even punched several people, breaking their noses. Me and Misato were watching the entire thing from the control room. They had to put you in restraints and it was only thanks to Misato that you were let out, after you had calmed down a bit."  
“……我想那部分是最让人担心的。指挥官下令回收 Eva 和你之后……嗯……他们打开插入栓时，你并不配合。那大概是最困难的部分。当他们好不容易把你弄出来时，你开始发狂，试图掐死任何靠近你的人，一边尖叫一边打人。你还打断了几个人的鼻子。我和美里在指挥室全程看着。他们不得不给你上约束带，多亏了美里，你稍微冷静一些后才被放出来。”

"Asuka I-" "明日香一号-"

"Don't say anything. I don't know what happened to you nor do I care. ...Everyone...including me, is just glad that you're fine."  
"什么都别说。我不知道你发生了什么，也不在乎。...包括我在内，大家都只是很高兴你没事。"

"But I did something that I had no control over."  
"但我做了一些我无法控制的事情。"

"You didn't do anything! You weren't in control. While I hate saying this, I know who you are, and that was definitely not the Shinji that I know inside of the Eva."  
"你什么都没做！你当时无法控制自己。虽然我不愿意这么说，但我知道你是谁，那绝对不是我在 Eva 里认识的真嗣。"

Shinji felt oddly touched by Asuka's words. It ment a lot to him that she had said she understood who he was, because he was starting to doubt himself.  
真嗣听到明日香的话，感到一种莫名的感动。她能说出理解他这个人，对他来说意义重大，因为他自己也开始怀疑自己了。

"I don't care what Ritsuko or your father says. That was not you, so don't go apologizing for it."  
"我才不管律子或你父亲怎么说。那不是你，所以别为此道歉。"

"...Asuka...I..." "...Asuka...我..."

"Quit it already! Just think of this as payment for helping myself out over the past few days."  
"别再说了！就当这是帮我过去几天忙的报酬吧。"

"...No...but anybody would have done that."  
"...不...但换作任何人都会那样做的。"

Asuka just glared at him and Shinji took that as an end to the conversation. Dragging the talk to something that was less unpleasant, Shinji said something that was sure to get Asuka rilled up.  
明日香只是瞪了他一眼，真嗣便识趣地结束了对话。为了转移到一个不那么令人不快的话题，真嗣说了一句肯定会让明日香激动起来的话。

"I'm surprised that you and Ayanami were able to be in the same room though, and for a long period of time."  
“我倒是挺惊讶你和绫波能待在同一个房间里，而且还是那么长时间。”

"Tch...why do you think I was sleeping? I'd rather waste time sleeping then try to have a conversation with the teachers pet."  
“切……你以为我为什么要睡觉？我宁愿浪费时间睡觉，也不想和那个老师的宠儿说话。”

Sighing, Shinji said, "I don't know why you're so stubborn. I get on fine with Ayanami."  
叹了口气，真嗣说：“我不知道你为什么这么固执。我和绫波相处得很好。”

"Thats your problem, not mine."  
“那是你的问题，不是我的。”

Flopping back down onto his blankets, Shinji ignored any further mumbles and sighs from Asuka for a while and looked up at the white ceiling in front of him. White? Why did white feel so familiar all the sudden? As he wracked his brains to try to find an answer he heard Asuka say, "Well you're okay so I suppose I'll go."  
真嗣又躺回被子里，暂时无视了明日香更多的咕哝和叹息，抬头望着眼前的白色天花板。白色？为什么白色突然感觉如此熟悉？他绞尽脑汁试图找到答案，这时听到明日香说：“好吧，既然你没事，那我就走了。”

Nodding, Shinji said, "Okay I'll go with you...just as soon as I find my-"  
点头后，真嗣说：“好的，我会跟你一起去……只要我找到我的——”

Speaking up, Rei said, "Doctor Akagi wishes you to stay here tonight."  
丽开口说道：“赤木博士希望你今晚留在这里。”

Turning towards the sound of Rei's voice Shinji said, "Huh?"  
真嗣转向丽声音的方向说：“啊？”

"IvHate to agree with the pet but Ritsuko does want you to stay here tonight, just in case you have a relapse."  
"虽然不想同意那只宠物的意见，但律子确实希望你今晚留在这里，以防万一你复发。"

"I feel perfectly fine though."  
"但我感觉完全没问题。"

"No arguing!" "不许争辩！"

"But-" "但——"

Completely ignoring Shinji's protests, Asuka stood up, spun herself around, and wordlessly walked out of the room.  
完全无视真嗣的抗议，明日香站起身来，转了一圈，然后默默地走出了房间。

Shinji mouthed back at her sudden disappearance before running his hands through his hair. Well, he should be thankful that she had waited by his side for at least seven hours before he woke up. Turning to Rei he said, "She's probably right Ayanami. Even though she didn't want to say anything, she knows that I need to get some rest."  
真嗣对着她突然消失的背影张了张嘴，随后双手穿过头发。好吧，他应该感激她至少在他醒来前陪在他身边七个小时。转向绫波，他说道："她可能是对的，绫波。尽管她不想说什么，但她知道我需要休息。"

Understanding him perfectly fine, Rei stood up, setting the plate of apples on the table next to Shinji's bed and silently walked to the door. Though just as she was about to pass through the open door she turned and said, "Goodnight, Ikari-kun."  
完全理解他的心思，丽站起身来，将一盘苹果放在真嗣床边的桌上，然后默默走向门口。就在她即将穿过敞开的门时，她转过身来说道：“晚安，碇君。”

Shinji waited until he could hear her footsteps becoming quieter and quieter before he sprung into action. Carefully grabbing onto a loose edge of the bandages surrounding his arm, he carefully started to unwind them. What was underneath made Shinji feel sick to his stomach.  
真嗣一直等到她的脚步声越来越远，才迅速行动起来。他小心翼翼地抓住缠绕在手臂上的绷带松散的一角，开始仔细地解开。绷带下的景象让真嗣感到一阵恶心。

The skin of his arms looked as though large splinters of wood had been hammered into his arms, only to be pulled back out by the reverse side of the hammer. He had many scars pockmarked across his arms and wondered how in the hell he could have received that from the glass barrier.  
他手臂上的皮肤看起来像是被大块的木片钉进去，然后又被锤子的另一头拔出来。他的手臂上布满了疤痕，他不禁疑惑自己究竟是如何从玻璃屏障上受到这样的伤害的。

...He felt stupid. ...他觉得自己很蠢。

Glass is still glass no matter how you look at it. Unit 01 must have managed to split off several pieces in its rage and some of it had been lodged into its armor and in turn Shinji had received these large puncture marks. Though he had to assume that they had been bleeding when he received them, yet here they were, clearly healed as though he had received them two months ago. Yet he always seemed to heal easily, even larger injuries. He remember in the fourth grade when he had broken his arm on the swing set. One week later his arm was fully healed.  
玻璃终究是玻璃，无论你怎么看。初号机在愤怒中必定是设法分裂出了几块碎片，其中一些嵌入了它的装甲，进而刺入了真嗣的身体，留下了这些深深的刺痕。尽管他不得不假设这些伤口在他受伤时是流血的，但此刻它们明显愈合了，仿佛是两个月前受的伤。然而他总是容易愈合，即使是更大的伤口。他记得四年级时在秋千上摔断了胳膊，一周后手臂就完全康复了。

"..._something about you..."_  
“...你身上有些什么...”

This sudden thought struck him like a bolt of lightning and he started looking around for the source of this sudden thought. Why did it feel like he had heard these words in the same context.  
这个突如其来的念头如闪电般击中了他，他开始四处寻找这个突然出现的想法的源头。为什么感觉好像在同样的情境下听过这些话。

'I've got to be over thinking this,' he said to himself as he rolled over and tried to close his eyes.  
'我一定是想太多了，'他自言自语道，翻了个身，试图闭上眼睛。

Sleep did not come easily that night  
那一晚，睡眠并不轻易降临

### Chapter 11: Emotions
**Hey everyone, its Halloween...well okay it just turned halloween fourteen minutes ago according to my clock. So yeah I'm posting this very early...because I'm declaring this Double Sunday. (Dragon Ball Z anyone?) So I'm actually releasing two chapters today, the first this obviously and the second one well...I've only gotten five pages out of...twenty-five? I'll try to get it out around two, (Pacific time) but I'm not making an promises. I actually had to help with a friends haunted house yesterday and pulled an all nighter at his house to finish this...Yes I'm very tired. I have not slept yet. There is something oddly fun about dressing up as a clown and scaring little kids though. I don't know...maybe its cause I'm reading It right now. (Stephen King)  
大家好，今天是万圣节...好吧，根据我的时钟，万圣节刚刚过去了十四分钟。所以我提前发布了这个...因为我宣布今天是双周日。（有人看过《龙珠 Z》吗？）所以今天我会发布两章，第一章显然是这个，第二章嘛...我只写出了五页...总共二十五页？我会尽量在两点前完成（太平洋时间），但不保证。昨天我实际上还帮朋友布置了鬼屋，在他家通宵完成了这个...是的，我非常累。我还没睡过觉。不过，装扮成小丑吓唬小孩子倒是挺有趣的。我不知道...可能是因为我正在读《它》（斯蒂芬·金）。**

**Okay so few quick things. Number one is that chapter twelve is...not really halloween themed, but its certainly horrifying and gruesome enough in its own right. So thats kinda my treat to everyone. Number two: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT BOAT LOAD OF REVIEW. I had so many reviews/favs/alerts that it started going into my spam box for my email. Anyway this is getting long winded and what not so I'm gonna end it here. Also at the end of this will be a brief preview of the next chapter..just the first two paragraphs. Read at your own risk!  
好了，有几个要点快速说一下。第一，第十二章并不是真正意义上的万圣节主题，但它本身足够恐怖和血腥。所以这算是我给大家的小小惊喜。第二：非常感谢大家的海量评论！我收到了太多评论/收藏/提醒，以至于它们开始涌入我的垃圾邮件箱。话说回来，我这番话已经有点啰嗦了，所以就到此为止吧。另外，文末会有下一章的简短预览，仅前两段。阅读请自行斟酌风险！**

Shinji could feel that something had changed, both inside and outside.  
真嗣能感觉到，内外都发生了变化。

He spent much of the next day at Nerv, cooped up in the room with nothing to look at but white walls. He felt like he was some experiment that they had locked up and were now running tests on. When he asked Ritsuko why he had to be kept there for an extra day, and why he would occasionally have to be taken to another room where he would be hooked up to all sorts of computer equipment, she simply said it was to be sure he hadn't been contaminated in any way. Did they consider him stupid?  
第二天大部分时间，他都待在 NERV，困在一个除了白墙别无他物的房间里。他觉得自己就像是被锁起来进行实验的对象，时不时还要被带到另一个房间，连接到各种电脑设备上。当他问律子为什么他需要多留一天，以及为什么偶尔要被带到另一个房间时，她只是简单地说这是为了确保他没有受到任何污染。他们难道认为他很愚蠢吗？

He had noticed a change in the personal the moment he had left his room; they shunned away from him. Small things he would notice, like lack of eye contact, or jitteriness whenever he would get near to somebody. Bottom line was, he suspected they had suddenly become afraid of him. And a part of him couldn't blame them, if what Asuka had said was true, which he highly doubted after seeing this.  
自从他离开房间的那一刻起，他就注意到工作人员的态度发生了变化；他们开始回避他。他会注意到一些细微的事情，比如缺乏眼神交流，或者每当他靠近某人时，对方就会显得紧张不安。总之，他怀疑他们突然对他产生了恐惧。而有一部分的他无法责怪他们，如果明日香所说的是真的，尽管在看到这些后他高度怀疑。

Above all else, he had noticed a change within himself. He seemed more sensitive to his environment, and specifically the facial features of people. His visions had gotten stronger to the point of several minutes of time passing when he couldn't remember what he had been doing minutes before. He felt no change in his physical body, and yet felt that he had grown...an extension of some kind. Like he could project it if his thoughts willed it to.  
最重要的是，他注意到自己内心的变化。他对环境的敏感度似乎提高了，特别是对人们的面部特征。他的视觉能力变得更强，以至于有几次他记不清几分钟前自己在做什么，时间就这样流逝了几分钟。他感觉自己的身体没有变化，但却觉得自己成长了...某种形式的延伸。仿佛只要他的思维愿意，就能将其投射出来。

Something had happened, he was sure of that. Try as hard as he might, he was not able to remember anything from his time enclosed inside of Unit 01. Occasionally he thought he got brief flashes of things that had either happened inside the entry plug, and outside the entry plug. And yet, he felt there was a gap of some kind that was missing. He kept thinking of the ocean and how the sand felt as it crunched between a persons toes.  
某件事情确实发生了，他对此深信不疑。尽管他竭尽全力，却无法回忆起自己在初号机内被封闭期间的任何事情。偶尔，他会觉得自己捕捉到了一些短暂的片段，无论是发生在插入栓内还是外面的。然而，他感觉似乎缺失了某种间隙。他不断想起海洋，以及沙子在人们脚趾间嘎吱作响的感觉。

It was the lowest point he had reached while he had been a pilot at Nerv. The only thing that he found remotely enjoyable was the fact that Asuka seemed to have spent every moment that day by his side. Granted, she was forced to go to school by Misato since they had missed so much recently, but besides that, she had been by his side when he had awoken in the morning, and when she had left late that night. He was even visited by Rei, during the time Asuka was at school and spend a few hours with her. It never occurred to him to ask why she wasn't at school herself.  
这是他在 NERV 担任驾驶员期间所经历的最低谷。唯一让他略感欣慰的是，明日香似乎那一天每时每刻都陪在他身边。当然，由于最近缺课太多，美里强迫她去上学，但除此之外，她在他早晨醒来时就在他身边，直到深夜她离开时也是如此。明日香上学期间，绫波零也来探望过他，与他共度了几小时。他从未想过要问她为什么自己不去上学。

All in all it had been a hectic day for Shinji and he was immensely glad to be back at Misato's apartment a day later. Well, standing on the door step felt more accurate to say as he hadn't even put his hand on the doorknob yet. Though he was saved the trouble as the door was thrown open, during which Shinji got an eye full of bright, strawberry colored hair, before he was wrenched into the open door and greeted by raucous group of people.  
总的来说，这一天对真嗣来说异常忙碌，他非常高兴能在一天后回到美里小姐的公寓。嗯，站在门口更准确地说，因为他还没来得及伸手去摸门把手。不过，门突然被打开了，真嗣眼前一亮，看到了一头鲜艳的草莓色头发，随后他被拽进了门内，迎接他的是一群喧闹的人。

"WELCOME BACK SHINJI," was hollered so loud that Shinji was sure the neighbors below them would call the police.  
“欢迎回来，真嗣！”这声大喊如此响亮，真嗣确信楼下邻居会报警。

A large group of people had been crowded into the small kitchen that Shinji thought could never house so many people.  
一大群人挤进了狭小的厨房，真嗣觉得这里从来没容纳过这么多人。

Asuka, Touji, Kensuke, Hikari, Rei, Misato, and a man that Shinji didn't recognize, were grouped around the small kitchen table, all with beaming faces and holding some kind of drink. In Misato's case it was a beer can.  
明日香、冬二、真希、光、丽、美里，还有一位真嗣不认识的男子，围坐在小厨房的桌子旁，每个人都面带笑容，手里拿着某种饮料。美里手里的是一罐啤酒。

Shinji stood dumbstruck in the doorway, attempting to take in the scene before him, but failing miserably, and it was only thanks to a sudden bark like cry from Touji that he was able to speak.  
真嗣呆立在门口，试图理解眼前的景象，却完全无法做到，直到冬二突然发出一声像狗吠般的喊叫，他才得以开口说话。

"...Everyone...you didn't have to do-"  
“……大家……你们不必这么做——”

Misato cut him off quickly, saying, "Don't worry about anything. We heard that you would be let out early and just thought to throw this surprise party is all. You gave us a real scare Shinji."  
美里迅速打断他，说道：“别担心任何事。我们听说你会提前出院，只是想给你一个惊喜派对。你可真是把我们吓坏了，真嗣。”

"Even so," mumbled Shinji as he looked at the streamers that hung from the ceiling and the balloons that floated on the back of the chairs, "isn't this going a little overboard?"  
“即便如此，”真嗣低声说道，目光扫过天花板上悬挂的彩带和椅背上飘浮的气球，“这会不会有点过头了？”

"I tried to tell her that, but she couldn't help herself," sighed Asuka.  
“我试图告诉她，但她就是控制不住，”明日香叹息道。

Misato shot her a frown with a raised eyebrow and said, "What are you talking about? The entire party was your-"  
美里皱着眉头，挑起一边的眉毛对她说：“你在说什么呢？整个派对都是你——”

The rest of her sentence was cut off as Asuka planted her hand over Misato's mouth, silencing her instantly. Though Shinji got the gist, and felt oddly touched by the thought. He didn't think he would have felt the same if it was anybody other than Asuka.  
她的话还没说完，就被明日香用手捂住了嘴，立刻安静了下来。虽然真嗣大致明白了意思，但这个想法让他感到奇怪的感动。如果换成别人，他可能不会有同样的感觉。

"We've got food and drink Shinji," barked Touji who Shinji suspected had tagged along largely for the food, but was all together glad that him and Kensuke had made it. But did that mean that-  
“我们有吃的和喝的，真嗣。”冬二大声说道，真嗣怀疑他主要是为了食物才跟来的，但他还是很高兴他和健介能来。但这意味着——

"...I'm surprised that you guys are here anyway," said Shinji as he reached for a glass of punch. "I thought you weren't supposed to know about the-"  
"...我真没想到你们会在这里，" 真嗣说着伸手去拿一杯潘趣酒。"我以为你们不应该知道关于——"

"Well...we don't know why you had been hospitalized, but we understand that something went wrong with your Eva and you were trapped inside it," said Kensuke  
"嗯...我们不知道你为什么住院，但我们知道你的 Eva 出了问题，你被困在里面了，" 健介说道

Shinji almost spit out his punch at this blatant release of Nerv information. Glancing at Misato, slightly worried, he whispered back, "Did she find out?"  
听到这番对 NERV 机密的直接泄露，真嗣差点把嘴里的潘趣酒喷出来。他瞥了一眼美里，略带担忧地低声问道："她发现了没？"

"I think she's known for a while," said Touji without any worry about whether he could be heard or not. "We asked Asuka what happened to you yesterday at school. Predictably...she told us to go fuck ourselves. She was in a particularly pissy mood yesterday and almost broke a desk over another students back for making fun of you. I think she should have actually...would have been funny as hell."  
"我觉得她早就知道了，" 真嗣说道，丝毫不担心是否会被别人听到。"我们问明日香昨天你在学校发生了什么事。不出所料...她让我们滚蛋。她昨天心情特别糟糕，差点把桌子砸在另一个嘲笑你的学生背上。我觉得她真该那么做...那场面一定搞笑极了。"

"Then what about Hikari?"  
"那光呢？"

"Huh, her? She just sorta tagged along after she heard that we were going to ask Misato personally. I have no idea how much she knows about the Eva's though."  
"她啊？她听说我们要亲自问美里小姐，就跟着一起来了。不过我完全不知道她对 EVA 了解多少。"

Shinji stole a glance over by Hikari and Asuka who were both leaning against the fridge and talking. With Shinji's heightened perception he was able to catch Hikari's eyes flickering over to them occasionally and thought he kinda knew why as her eyes seemed to be directed at Touji. He even caught Asuka's eyes flickering over to himself a few times.  
真嗣偷偷瞥了一眼那边，看见光和明日香正靠在冰箱旁聊天。凭借敏锐的感知，他注意到光偶尔会朝他们这边瞟来，目光似乎是落在冬二身上，这让他隐约猜到了原因。甚至有几次，他捕捉到明日香的目光也朝自己这边闪烁。

"So then what? Misato just told you guys about the Eva's?"  
“那然后呢？美里只是告诉你们关于 EVA 的事吗？”

"Well, she seemed to already guess that we knew too much and just blatantly said that you had been kept at Nerv because of an experiment problem with the Eva's."  
“嗯，她似乎已经猜到我们知道得太多了，就直接挑明说你被留在 NERV 是因为 EVA 实验出了问题。”

Shinji was rather taken aback. He would never have guessed that Misato would have blatantly spoken about the Eva's as though it was suitable for everyday conversation.  
真嗣颇为吃惊。他绝没想到美里会如此直白地谈论 EVA，仿佛这是日常对话的合适话题。

"What about this party then...?"  
“那这个派对呢……？”

Kensuke paused for a minute before looking over at Asuka. Determining that she wouldn't be able to hear him talking, he said, "She'll deny it, but the entire thing was her idea. I guess she heard that you would be released later today and forced Misato to drive her downtown to pick up a few things. Later she called me, Touji, and Hikari and told us that you would be arriving soon. So, we hurried over here..."  
健介顿了一下，然后看向明日香。确定她听不到自己说话后，他说道：“她会否认，但这一切都是她的主意。我猜她听说你今天晚些时候会被释放，就逼美里开车带她去市区买了些东西。后来她给我、阿薰和光打电话，告诉我们你很快就会到。于是，我们急忙赶了过来……”

Kensuke left his sentence dangling as he went back for more punch with Touji following him, his thoughts wrapped around seconds.  
真嗣又偷偷朝明日香和光的方向瞥了一眼，但这次他的目光只锁定在明日香身上。她似乎察觉到了他的注视，因为她微微皱眉，将头发甩到背后，转过身去，让真嗣只能看到她的背影。天啊，她真喜欢逗他。

Shinji stole another glance in Asuka and Hikari's direction, though this time his sights were solely set on Asuka. She seemed to catch him starring though, because she turned her head towards him before grimacing slightly. Throwing her hair behind her back, she turned around so Shinji would have to settle for a rear view. God she liked to tease him.  
健介的话还没说完就回去再倒些潘趣酒，东治跟着他，心里想着再来一杯。

"Not a bad party," said someone suddenly to his left.  
“派对不错嘛。”突然有人在他左边说道。

Turning towards the sound of the voice, Shinji saw a man with brown hair tied back in a pony tail and a few stubbles where a beard would have been. He was wearing a blue work shirt with matching blue jeans. Like Misato, he had a beer in his hand.  
转向声音的来源，真嗣看到一个棕色头发扎成马尾的男人，下巴上有些胡茬。他穿着一件蓝色工作衬衫和配套的蓝色牛仔裤。和美里一样，他手里也拿着一瓶啤酒。

"Kaji," he said while holding out his hand to shake Shinji's.  
“加持先生，”他一边说着，一边伸出手与真嗣握手。

Something seemed to dawn on Shinji as he grasped the man's hand and said, "Aren't you Misato's-"  
当真嗣握住男人的手时，他似乎突然明白了什么，说道：“您不是美里的……”

"Not since our college days."  
"自从大学时代就没这样了。"

Understanding that the subject wasn't one he'd want to elaborate on, he asked instead, "Misato went to college?"  
他明白这个话题他不想多谈，于是转而问道：“美里也上过大学？”

"Yeah. It was me, Misato, and Ritsuko. Course we all split up and worked on our own things. Though somehow we all ended up returning to Nerv."  
“是啊。当时有我、美里和律子。当然我们后来都各奔东西，各自发展。不过不知怎么的，我们最后都回到了 NERV。”

"...You work at Nerv?" "...你在 NERV 工作吗？"

"Yes...but what I do...I can't tell you. I've heard plenty about whats happened since I've been gone. How many angels? Four? I can't understand why they chose now of all times to attack. Though it seems like we don't have to worry with the children piloting the Eva's. We found you, the First Child, and then Asuka, the Second Child was brought here also."  
"是的...但我所做的...我不能告诉你。我离开后听说了许多发生的事情。有多少使徒？四个？我不明白为什么他们偏偏选择这个时候攻击。不过看起来我们不必担心，因为有孩子们在驾驶 EVA。我们找到了你，第一适格者，然后明日香，第二适格者也被带到了这里。"

Something about the way he said Asuka's name seemed to strike a nerv in Shinji.  
他提到明日香名字的方式似乎触动了真嗣的某根神经。

"Do you know Asuka?" "你知道明日香吗？"

"Sorta...I was stationed at the German branch of Nerv for a while and got to know her. I was like a guardian of some kind to her."  
"算是吧...我在德国的 Nerv 分部待过一段时间，那时认识了她。我有点像她的监护人之类的角色。"

Shinji felt a twang of jealousy hit his nerves, but passed it off. Really, thinking about them in any sort of relationship was just being paranoid.  
真嗣感到一阵嫉妒刺痛了他的神经，但他很快将其抛诸脑后。说真的，把他们想象成任何形式的关系都只是自己在瞎猜疑罢了。

Draining the last of his beer, he clapped Shinji on the shoulders and said, "Well, keep up the good work. Everyones depending on you and the other two to defeat the angels."  
喝干最后一口啤酒，他拍了拍真嗣的肩膀说：“嗯，继续努力。大家都在靠你和其他两人来打败使徒。”

As Shinji watched Kaji's retreating back, he was reminded again of why he had chosen to fight. He still couldn't answer that question. He knew that only the generation born after Second Impact was able to control the Eva's. So the adults who helped initiated Second Impact now relied on the younger generation to protect them when retribution came. How foolhardy could they be? Everyone was depending on him, Asuka, and Rei? What if they started rejecting Nerv's orders? Would they be replaced? This thought had never occurred to Shinji before and he wondered what made him suddenly think about this.  
看着加持远去的背影，真嗣再次想起了自己选择战斗的原因。他仍然无法回答这个问题。他知道只有第二次冲击后出生的一代人才能操控 EVA。所以那些帮助引发第二次冲击的成年人现在依赖年轻一代来保护他们，当报应来临时。他们能有多愚蠢？每个人都在依靠他、明日香和绫波？如果他们开始拒绝 NERV 的命令怎么办？他们会被人取代吗？这个念头以前从未在真嗣脑海中出现过，他不知道是什么让他突然想到这一点。

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

"What," he snapped back without thinking.  
“什么，”他未经思考就厉声回道。

Asuka was looking at him with a frown on her face, but Shinji thought that he could detect hurt in her eyes and suddenly rebuked himself for snapping at her.  
明日香皱着眉头看着他，但真嗣觉得他能在她的眼中察觉到一丝受伤，突然间为自己对她发火而自责。

"Sorry," he mumbled. "I didn't mean to snap at you. Just...thinking about some things."  
“对不起，”他咕哝着。“我不是有意对你发火的。只是……在想一些事情。”

Shrugging, Asuka said, "Forget it and come have some cake."  
明日香耸了耸肩，说道：“算了，过来吃点蛋糕吧。”

"...Huh?" "...啊？"

"Cake moron, Cake! We bought it at the store for you-"  
蛋糕白痴，蛋糕！我们是在店里给你买的——

Touji at this point stuck his head over Asuka's shoulders and said, "Liar. You made that cake yourself Asu-"  
这时，东治从明日香肩后探出头来说：“骗子。那蛋糕是你自己做的，明日——”

Asuka quickly silenced him by stabbing two of her fingers directly into Touji's eyes. Howling with pain, his eyes watering, Touji managed to shout back, "Damn it! What the hell was that for!"  
明日香迅速用两根手指直插东治的眼睛让他闭嘴。痛苦嚎叫的东治泪流满面，勉强回喊道：“该死！你这是干什么！”

"For being an annoying shit," yelled Asuka as she brought her fist down on top of Touji's head.  
“叫你烦人！”明日香大喊着，一拳砸在真嗣的头上。

Shinji couldn't help it, he laughed at Touji's misfortune for upsetting the demon. Though if Touji was correct in what he had been saying...well. Shinji glanced at Asuka out of the corner of his eyes, only to see that her cheeks had turned a light shade of pink.  
真嗣忍不住笑了起来，看着真嗣因为惹恼了小恶魔而倒霉。不过，如果真嗣说的是对的……嗯。真嗣用眼角瞥了一眼明日香，只见她的脸颊微微泛起了红晕。

"Oh forget it," hissed Asuka as she hit Touji upside the head one more time for good measure. Turning towards Shinji, with her forehead slightly creased as though she wasn't sure what she was doing, she grabbed him by his wrist, and dragged him over to the chocolate cake that she had painstakingly made.  
“算了，”明日香低声说着，又给了真嗣脑袋一拳，以示惩戒。她转向真嗣，眉头微皱，似乎不太确定自己在做什么，然后抓住他的手腕，把他拖到她精心制作的巧克力蛋糕前。

Grabbing a plate and jamming it into Shinji's hands, she mumbled, "Here," before spinning around, her hair whipping Shinji across the face, and walked back over to where Hikari was standing.  
她抓起一个盘子，塞进真嗣手里，咕哝着：“给，”然后转过身去，头发甩在真嗣脸上，走回光里站的地方。

'She could have at least waited till I told her what I thought about it,' sighed Shinji as he scooped a piece of it into his mouth.  
“她至少可以等我告诉她我的想法，”真嗣叹了口气，舀了一块放进嘴里。

It was good. Far better than he had expected actually, which he thought seemed a little rude.  
味道不错。比他预想的要好得多，这让他觉得有点失礼。

Finishing up his cake he looked around the kitchen, his eyes falling once again on the balloons and streamers. A smile spread across his face.  
吃完蛋糕后，他环顾厨房，目光再次落在气球和彩带上。他的脸上绽放出笑容。

---

'Really,' he thought as he stepped out of the shower later that day. 'It wasn't so bad I guess...having everyone over.'  
那天晚些时候，当他走出淋浴间时，心里想着：'其实，大家一起来也没那么糟糕...'

Everyone had left sometime ago and Shinji felt immensely better after stepping out of the shower. He felt like he had been contaminated in someway by staying at Nerv all of yesterday, and was just now getting the smell off his skin.  
所有人早已离开，真嗣洗完澡后感觉好多了。他觉得昨天在 NERV 待了一整天，自己仿佛被某种东西污染了，现在才刚刚把那股气味从皮肤上洗掉。

Looking at himself in the mirror, while he dried his hair, he once again found himself looking at the scars that painted his arms. Holding one arm up so that the light hit it better, he frowned at the difference between the pearly white skin, and the slightly tanned sections. He had wondered about it, but never had enough time to check.  
他一边擦干头发，一边对着镜子审视自己，又一次看到了那些遍布双臂的伤疤。他将一只手臂举起，让光线更好地照射，皱眉观察着珍珠般白皙的皮肤与略显晒黑的区域之间的差异。他对此感到好奇，但从未有足够的时间去仔细检查。

Tracing a finger over one of the scars, he measured the length of the scar and then turned his arm over. Measuring the rudimentary line between two scars, each on other sides of his arm, he came to the conclusion that the two scars were from the same piece of glass. But then...how can that be?  
他用手指轻轻划过其中一道疤痕，测量其长度，然后翻转手臂。在两道疤痕之间，分别位于手臂两侧的粗糙线条上比划着，他得出结论，这两道疤痕来自同一块玻璃。但随后...这怎么可能呢？

The pilot and the Eva are connected through the power of synchronization. Thoughts, willpower...whatever. He knew this much. But if an Eva suffers a wound, and it is in turn transferred to the pilot, does the size of the wound get transferred to the pilot? He understood that his case was a rarity, but did that mean that his body could be dismembered, just because the Eva's was? It wasn't a happy thought, but it was one that held meaning nonetheless. He certainly didn't want to imagine himself in a scene where Unit 01 was decapitated, and suddenly his head just popped off like a dolls.  
驾驶员与 Eva 通过同步率的力量相连。思想、意志……诸如此类。他对此心知肚明。但如果 Eva 受伤，伤势会转嫁到驾驶员身上，那么伤口的大小也会一并转移吗？他明白自己的情况实属罕见，但这意味着他的身体会因为 Eva 的肢解而四分五裂吗？这个念头并不愉快，却意义深远。他当然不愿设想初号机被斩首时，自己的头颅也像玩偶一样突然掉落的场景。

"You need to stop worrying yourself so much," he mumbled to the empty bathroom. "Nothing has changed that makes you any diff-"  
“你得少操心些，”他对着空荡荡的浴室喃喃自语，“没什么变化会让你有所不同——”

His thought process froze.  
他的思绪戛然而止。

He had been looking at himself in the mirror, when...no...trick of the lighting. Why would he think his eyes all the sudden flashed scar-  
他一直在镜子前打量自己，突然...不...只是灯光的把戏。为何他会觉得自己的眼睛突然闪现出伤痕——

"Shinji! You done in there!"  
“真嗣！你好了没！”

Asuka's voice came loud through the bathroom door, and rather anxious at that.  
明日香的声音透过浴室门大声传来，显得相当焦急。

Jumping at the sudden volume in her voice, he snapped his head around, but in his enthusiasm to reply, managed to slip on the wet floor, and went tumbling down on his back with a loud thud.  
被她突如其来的大声吓了一跳，他猛地转过头，却在急于回应时，不慎滑倒在湿漉漉的地板上，伴随着一声巨响，重重地摔了个四脚朝天。

"Shinji? ...Oi Baka! What the hell just happened in there!"  
“真嗣？……喂，笨蛋！刚才里面到底发生了什么！”

As Shinji groaned at the pain of his back which had hit hard against the marmoleum floor, he heard a click of the doorknob being turned and realized that he hadn't locked the door.  
真嗣因背部重重撞击在马赛克地板上的疼痛而呻吟，此时他听到门把手转动的咔嗒声，意识到自己忘了锁门。

"Shinji, what the hell-WHAAAH!"  
"真嗣，搞什么鬼——哇啊！"

Asuka took one, maybe two steps into the bathroom, before skidding on the wet floor, and falling backwards on her butt. Opening her eyes tentatively, and wincing slightly at the pain that had coursed through her as she hit the floor, she looked at Shinji who was just propping himself up on his elbows. If she had noticed earlier...well, things would have turned out differently, instead she grimly yelled, "You idiot! Why the hell did you flood the bathroom!"  
明日香刚踏进浴室，也许只走了两步，就在湿滑的地板上滑倒了，一屁股坐在地上。她小心翼翼地睁开眼睛，微微皱眉，感受着摔倒时传遍全身的疼痛。她看着真嗣，他正用肘部支撑着自己起身。如果她早些注意到...好吧，事情可能会有所不同，但她还是气愤地大喊：“你这个白痴！为什么要把浴室弄得水漫金山！”

Shinji stubbornly retorted back, "This always happens. That damn shower doesn't drain the water all the way so some of it comes out onto the floor."  
真嗣倔强地反驳道：“这种情况经常发生。那个该死的淋浴头排水不畅，总有些水流到地板上。”

"I never have any problems with it!"  
"我从来没遇到过任何问题！"

"Which amazes me because you spend almost an hour in there everyday. Its probably clogged from your hair anyway."  
"这让我很惊讶，因为你每天几乎要在里面待上一个小时。可能是因为你的头发堵住了。"

Asuka's anger overflowed here. Standing up briskly, she stood over a naked Shinji who had nothing but a towel covering his privates, bent down, and glared at him before saying, "...It was Misato's hair..."  
绫波的怒气在此爆发。她迅速站起身，站在只用一条毛巾遮住私处的真嗣面前，弯下腰，瞪着他，然后说道：“……是美里小姐的头发……”

The two of them stared at each other for a moment, silence passing between them. Shinji had thought that she was going to step on his unprotected privates, and was still now, unsure of how he should react. Instead, Asuka took the lead.  
两人对视片刻，沉默在彼此间流淌。真嗣原以为她会踩到他毫无保护的私处，此刻仍不确定该如何反应。然而，明日香主动打破了僵局。

Standing up straight, she sighed at him and said, "Whatever, just get the mop and fix this m-m-me-me-WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU!"  
她挺直身子，对他叹了口气，说道：“算了，拿拖把来收拾一下这……这……这……这他妈的你到底怎么了！”

Realization had struck Asuka none to gently, as Shinji made to stand up, and only then noticing that the towel was no longer fastened around his waist. Glancing up quickly, he saw a bright red Asuka, who seemed to be frozen in place, with her eyes nothing but sunken sockets. Had it really been that traumatizing?  
明日香突然意识到什么，真嗣正要站起来，这时才注意到腰间的毛巾已经松开。他迅速抬头，只见明日香满脸通红，仿佛僵在原地，双眼空洞无神。真的有那么令人震惊吗？

"Asuka-" "明日香——"

His voice seemed to send her out of her own world, as her face turned a darker shade of red. Breathing heavily, her entire face flushed, she started mumbling uncontrollably under her breath.  
他的声音似乎将她从自己的世界中拉了出来，她的脸变得更红了。呼吸急促，整张脸涨得通红，她开始不由自主地喃喃自语。

"...Asuka?" "...明日香？"

"...Oh God I think I'm gonna puke..." was all she managed to say before she ran out of the bathroom. Shinji could hear retching sounds coming from the kitchen and knew he'd be the one to clean it up later. Wrapping the towel around his waist more securely, he had to admit that he had gotten away with nothing more than a brief outburst.  
"...哦天哪，我想我要吐了..." 这是她跑出浴室前勉强说出的话。真嗣能听到从厨房传来的呕吐声，知道稍后得由他来清理。他更紧地裹住腰间的毛巾，不得不承认自己只是侥幸逃过了一场短暂的爆发。

Asuka meanwhile was hovering over the sink making fake retching noises. She did not want Shinji to see her in such a state, even if it killed her. She _had_ actually been pretty close to puking when she had seen...no...don't think about it. Nothing! Nothing at all. She found it easier to fain ignorance, and just act on emotions. And there were a lot of emotions running through her.  
与此同时，明日香正悬在洗手池上方，发出假装的呕吐声。她不想让真嗣看到自己这副模样，哪怕这会要了她的命。实际上，当她看到...不...别想了。什么都没有！什么都没有。她发现假装无知，只凭情感行事更容易。而此刻她的内心充斥着各种情感。

Looking up as she heard the bathroom door close, she stole a glance behind herself, in time to see Shinji walking down the hallway with a towel wrapped around his waist. She didn't know what she felt, but it was both disgusting and pleasant. Disgusting because it was new to her and because she felt weak because of it, but pleasant because it made her shiver, and not a bad shiver. It was like the kind that goes down your spine; that made you feel suddenly cold but inexplicably warm afterwards.  
听到浴室门关闭的声音，她抬头望去，正好瞥见真嗣腰间裹着毛巾走过走廊。她不知道自己是什么感觉，但既令人厌恶又愉悦。厌恶是因为这对她来说是全新的体验，也因为这种感觉让她感到虚弱，但愉悦是因为它让她颤抖，并非不好的颤抖。就像那种沿着脊椎传来的感觉；让你突然感到寒冷，但随后又莫名地温暖起来。

Turning off the fossett, she let out a weary sigh before slinking into the living room and sinking onto the soft couch.  
关掉水龙头，她疲惫地叹了口气，然后悄悄走进客厅，陷进柔软的沙发里。

'What is wrong with me?' Why does that idiot always resurface in my mind every time I push him away?'  
“我这是怎么了？”为什么每次我试图把他赶走，那个傻瓜总是会重新浮现在我的脑海中？

Rolling over, she intended to flip on the T.V. and absorb herself in whatever was on, when she felt a soft flop somewhere over by her legs, and a shift in the couch cushions. Craning her neck upwards, she saw that Shinji had plopped himself directly in between her spread out legs, with a book in one hand, and his SDAT laying across his knee.  
她翻身打算打开电视，沉浸在任何正在播放的节目中，这时她感觉到腿边有什么柔软的东西一晃而过，沙发垫也跟着移动。她抬头一看，发现真嗣已经一屁股坐在她张开的双腿之间，一手拿着书，SDAT 播放器横放在膝盖上。

It was a mark of how used she was to his presence that Asuka didn't immediately chase him out of the room. She had even...what? Become so used to it that it was enjoyable to be with him? ...Where the hell did that idea come from?  
这表明她已经习惯了他的存在，以至于明日香并没有立即把他赶出房间。她甚至……什么？变得如此习惯以至于和他在一起变得愉快了？……这个念头到底是从哪儿冒出来的？

As her eyes strayed over his body, they fell on the fact that his hair was still dripping wet, his clothing consisting of a pair of shorts and a loose tang top. And-  
当她的目光掠过他的身体时，落在了他的头发依旧滴着水，身上只穿着一条短裤和一件宽松的唐装上衣。而且——

'Enough!' Asuka bellowed in her mind. 'Stop looking at him like that!'  
'够了！'明日香在心中咆哮。'别那样看他！'

Shinji seemed to notice the sudden changes in her facial features out of the corner of his eye. Plucking the earbuds out of his ears he asked, "Something wrong?"  
真嗣似乎注意到了她面部表情的突然变化，从眼角瞥见。他摘下耳塞问道，"怎么了？"

"Not at all," she said testily as she turned her head back to the T.V.  
"一点也不，"她不耐烦地说着，将头转回电视。

Shinji frowned, hoping that her mind wasn't trapped in a time loop that consisted of those few seconds in the bathroom when she might have gotten a glimpse of his...well, best not to worry about that.  
真嗣皱眉，希望她的思维没有被困在一个时间循环中，那个循环只包含她在浴室里可能瞥见他...呃，最好别担心那件事。

Sinking more comfortably into the couch cushions, Shinji brought his feet up and rested them on the edge of the couch cushion he was on. If only he could have seen Asuka's face as it turned several shades of pink before becoming a dark maroon. The ankles of Shinji's feet were making contact with one ofAsuka's ankles.  
真嗣更舒适地沉入沙发垫中，抬起脚放在他坐的沙发垫边缘。如果他能看见明日香的脸，那张脸先是泛起几层粉红，然后变成深酒红色。真嗣的脚踝正触碰到明日香的脚踝。

Asuka had surprising control over her body, (though a complete lack of control over her emotions) as she was able to prevent her body from twitching or becoming completely rigid. Though she felt like her head would soon explode if she didn't do something about his ankle touching her ankle. It felt to similar to footsie.  
明日香对身体有着惊人的控制力，（尽管在情感上完全失控），她能够防止自己的身体抽搐或变得完全僵硬。虽然她感觉如果不对他的脚踝触碰她的脚踝做些什么，她的头很快就会爆炸。这种感觉太像是在玩脚戏了。

Trying as naturally as possible, she pulled herself up and into a sitting position on the couch, effectively moving her legs a good distance away from Shinji's. He didn't even spare her glance as she did this, his mind entirely focused on his book. Though something he had been meaning to tell her seemed to be nagging at the back of his mind. But he couldn't quite remember-  
她尽可能自然地将自己拉起，坐到了沙发上，有效地将双腿从真嗣的身边移开。她这样做时，他甚至没有看她一眼，他的心思完全集中在他的书上。虽然他一直想告诉她的事情似乎在脑海中挥之不去。但他就是记不起来——

'Oh...right,' he thought suddenly.  
'哦...对了，'他突然想到。

Putting his book down and sliding the SDAT off his knees, he turned to Asuka and said, "I had forgotten about it until now, but I had ment to say thank you for the party earlier."  
放下手中的书，将 SDAT 从膝盖上滑落，他转向明日香说道：“我直到现在才想起，我本打算为之前的派对向你道谢的。”

Asuka, who had tensed up slightly when she heard his voice, relax immensely and replied back, "Don't worry about it. Misato helped plenty so you should really be thanking her-"  
明日香听到他的声音时微微紧张了一下，随即放松下来，回答道：“别放在心上。美里帮了不少忙，你真该感谢她——”

"...But you're the one that planned everything and called Touji and the others."  
“……但策划一切并叫来东治和其他人的是你。”

"You make it sound like I did all the hard work. I did all the easy stuff and let Misato do the hard stu-"  
"你这么说好像我做了所有辛苦的工作似的。我只是做了些简单的部分，难的都让美里做了——"

"And the cake. That cake you made...it was really good, far better than any you could have found at the store."  
"还有那块蛋糕。你做的那块蛋糕……真的很好吃，比店里买的任何一块都要好。"

Silence passed for a minute, during which Asuka struggled to get her face a normal shade of color. She was pleased, even grateful for the praise that he had for her. It had honestly been her first time making a cake and she found herself going over in her mind all the ingredients she had used, being sure that she had not forgotten a step.  
沉默持续了一分钟，期间明日香努力让自己的脸色恢复正常。她对得到的赞扬感到高兴，甚至有些感激。这确实是她第一次做蛋糕，她不禁在脑海中反复回想所用的所有原料，确保自己没有遗漏任何步骤。

Getting her emotions under control, she turned towards Shinji and said as cooly as she could muster, "Flattery will get you nowhere."  
她努力控制住情绪，转向真嗣，尽可能冷静地说：“奉承对我没用。”

"...No...I just, thought I'd let you know. ...Thanks."  
“……不……我只是，想让你知道。……谢谢。”

Abandoning her coolness, Asuka grinned back at him and said, "Don't worry about it. I'm just glad you're back."  
阿斯卡放弃了冷静，笑着对他说：“别在意。我只是很高兴你回来了。”

"You're just glad that you didn't have to eat Misato's cooking."  
"你只是庆幸自己不必吃美里做的饭。"

"Well, there's that, and..." Shinji only caught the first part of this as Asuka trailed off at the end, leaving her sentence hanging.  
"嗯，还有...“ 真嗣只听到了前半部分，因为明日香说到最后就停了下来，让她的句子悬而未决。

Though something else was still bothering him. What was it? He knew it had something to do with Asuka...but what?  
尽管还有其他事情困扰着他。那是什么？他知道这与明日香有关...但究竟是什么呢？

Germany! And then it clicked.  
德国！然后一切就明白了。

"Asuka...who was that guy at the party?"  
“明日香...派对上的那个家伙是谁？”

"..."

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

"What!" “什么！”

"Who was that guy I didn't know at the party?"  
"在派对上那个我不认识的家伙是谁？"

Asuka seemed as though she would like nothing better to whack Shinji in the head then for interrupting her program. Why was he asking something like that when she had seen them talking?  
明日香看起来恨不得立刻给真嗣一拳，就因为他打断了她的节目。她明明看到他们交谈过，为什么还要问这种问题？

"You already know who he is. His name is Kaji, Kaji Ryoji. You talked to him so why are you asking that? Its irritating."  
"你已经知道他是谁了。他叫加持良治。你和他谈过话的，为什么还要问这个？真烦人。"

"...No...just that when I talked to him, he seemed to know you...because of Germany. So I just wondered..."  
"...不...只是当我跟他交谈时，他似乎认识你...因为德国。所以我只是好奇..."

Asuka was able to abandon the T.V. completely this time and frowned back at Shinji. Was she understanding this correctly? Was Shinji acting jealous?  
这次，明日香完全放弃了电视，皱着眉头回望真嗣。她理解对了吗？真嗣是在吃醋吗？

"What are you implying?" She said with her eyes narrowed. While she was somewhat pleased that he was acting jealous, he felt that it was directed at someone...who just the idea of being with made her want to puke. Kaji was attractive...you know, to people of Misato's age.  
"你在暗示什么？" 她眯起眼睛说道。虽然她有点高兴他吃醋了，但她感觉这针对的是某个人...一想到和那人在一起就让她想吐。加持很有魅力...你知道的，对美里那个年纪的人来说。

"...Nothing," said Shinji hurriedly. "I just wondered-"  
"没什么，" 真嗣急忙说道。"我只是好奇——"

"Then you can stop worrying about something nonexistent. He was someone like a father figure, nothing more. So stop being jealous."  
"那你就不用担心不存在的事情了。他就像一个父亲的形象，仅此而已。所以别再嫉妒了。"

"Jealous? I'm not jealous of him!"  
"嫉妒？我才不会嫉妒他！"

"Well you sure do a great job of play acting then," grimaced Asuka. Now she was just irritated by his irrational thoughts. God he could be so infuriating sometimes.  
"好吧，你演戏的本事确实一流，" 明日香皱着眉头说道。现在她对他的无理取闹感到更加恼火。天哪，他有时真是让人气不打一处来。

"You know what, forget I said anything."  
"你知道吗，当我没说。"

"I'll do just that," said Asuka without another thought on the matter; her previously emotions replaced by ones of annoyance.  
"我正有此意，" 明日香说完便不再多想此事；她先前的情绪已被恼怒所取代。

Annoyed with Asuka's misunderstanding, Shinji stalked off into his own room.  
因明日香误解而感到恼火，真嗣气冲冲地走进自己的房间。

'Jealous,' he thought somewhat savagely. 'No way in hell I'd be jealous because of that.'  
‘嫉妒，’他有些恼怒地想，‘我才不会因为那家伙嫉妒呢。’

'Ah, but you felt something while talking to Kaji,' a voice in his head whispered.  
‘啊，但你在和加持谈话时确实感觉到了什么，’他脑海中的声音低语道。

Ignoring the voice in his head, Shinji laid down in his bed, and turned towards the light of the open window.  
无视脑海中的声音，真嗣躺倒在床上，转向敞开的窗户透进的光亮。

"..."

At what point his thought became dreams, and sleep became a reality, he had no idea. He only knew that it felt as though minutes had past since him and Asuka had parted on a not so friendly note, when he felt himself being shaken awake by Misato.  
他不知道自己的思绪何时变成了梦境，睡眠何时成了现实。他只知道，在与明日香不欢而散后，仿佛只过了几分钟，就被美里摇醒了。

"Shinji...Shinji...wake up."  
“真嗣……真嗣……醒醒。”

Blinking in the dim light of his room he saw Misato leaning over him with a worried expression on her face. In the doorway of his room, he could see a fully dressed and anxious Asuka standing there.  
在昏暗的房间灯光下，他眨了眨眼，看到美里俯身在他上方，脸上带着担忧的表情。在他的房门口，可以看到穿着整齐、神情焦虑的明日香站在那里。

"Whazthematter," he managed to mumble back in his dream like state.  
“怎么了？”他迷迷糊糊地嘟囔着。

Misato's words sent his eyes wide open.  
美里的话让他的眼睛猛地睁大。

"Angel attack. Its due to land in another-," glancing at her watch she said, "-hour. Hurry up. This was totally unexpected and I hate to admit it but caught us completely off guard."  
"天使袭击。预计在一小时后登陆，" 她瞥了一眼手表说道，"快点。这完全出乎意料，虽然我不愿意承认，但我们确实被打了个措手不及。"

Without any sign that he had two girls in his room, Shinji started flinging clothes in every direction as he hurried to get dressed.  
丝毫没有表现出房间里有两个女孩的迹象，真嗣开始慌乱地四处扔衣服，急忙穿好衣服。

"Where is it coming from?" Asked Shinji as he finished buttoning his shirt up.  
"它从哪儿来的？" 真嗣扣好衬衫问道。

"...We picked it up just outside the stratosphere."  
"...我们在平流层外围发现了它。"

"Space?" "太空？"

"Thats what it seems like. Its body's diameter is about the size of Tokyo-3. We believe that it plans to fall on the city, destroying it instantly."  
"看起来是这样。它的身体直径大约和第三新东京市相当。我们相信它打算坠落在城市上，瞬间将其摧毁。"

Shinji starred wide eyed back at her. It could crush it all in seconds unless they did something.  
真嗣瞪大了眼睛回望着她。如果不采取行动，这一切可能在几秒钟内就会被摧毁。

"What are we supposed to-"  
“我们该怎么做——”

"I'll explain on the way. Just get in the car already."  
“路上我会解释的。快上车吧。”

Without giving her another reason to badger him, Shinji hurriedly followed Asuka's retreating back out the door.  
为了避免给她更多理由来纠缠自己，真嗣急忙跟着明日香退去的背影走出了门。

---

An angel attack at one in the morning? Shinji had never heard of anything stranger. He could imagine every citizen in Tokyo-3 being woken by the lady with the annoying voice to telling everybody to evacuated to the shelters. He could just picture Touji's face as he was told he had to go out into the freezing cold night. It made him smile...though it was only for a moment.  
凌晨一点的天使袭击？真嗣从未听说过比这更奇怪的事。他可以想象东京-3 的每一位市民都被那个烦人的声音吵醒，被告知要疏散到避难所。他甚至能想象出当被告知必须外出到寒冷的夜晚时，东治脸上的表情。这让他微笑了一下...尽管只是一瞬间。

The fact was they had a crisis on there hands. The angel had caught them so off guard that they barely had time to prepare for anything. Then there was the fact that the commander, Shinji's father, was not there. He had left for Antarctica apparently to search for something. What it was, Shinji had no idea.  
事实是他们面临一场危机。天使的突袭让他们措手不及，几乎没有时间做任何准备。此外，指挥官，也就是真嗣的父亲，并不在场。他显然是去了南极寻找某样东西。至于那是什么，真嗣一无所知。

Something that worried Shinji the most though, was that this would be the first time that all three pilots would be working together. He didn't find this as a problem...but he certainly thought that Asuka did. She had been pissed when Misato had explained the plan, putting great emphasis on the fact that all three Eva's would have to work together in order to defeat it.  
然而，最让真嗣担心的是，这将是三位驾驶员首次共同作战。他并不认为这是个问题……但他确信明日香肯定不这么想。当美里解释计划时，她非常强调所有三台 Eva 必须协同作战才能击败使徒，这让明日香非常恼火。

It seemed like suicide, but it was feasible. The angel was the size of Tokyo-3...and that proved a problem. Misato, however, had come up with a bold plan to combat the sheer size of the angel, dubbed Sahaquiel. The three Eva's would work together to produce one large AT-field to slow the angel down. Then the other two Eva's would project a strong enough AT-field, that would open a small hole that one of the Eva's would be able to tare through. The Eva (and here, Shinji felt that it would be his job ultimately) that was chosen for this last part, would produce a cone like AT-field to slash the angel in two, and destroy the core. At least, this was how it was supposed to work in theory.  
这看似是自杀行为，但却是可行的。使徒的体型与东京-3 相当……这确实是个难题。不过，美里制定了一个大胆的计划来对抗使徒萨哈奎尔的庞大身躯。三台 Eva 将协同工作，生成一个巨大的 AT 力场来减缓使徒的速度。然后，另外两台 Eva 将投射出一个足够强大的 AT 力场，打开一个小洞，让其中一台 Eva 能够撕裂进去。被选中的那台 Eva（在这里，真嗣觉得最终会是他的任务）将产生一个锥形的 AT 力场，将使徒一分为二，并摧毁核心。至少，理论上应该是这样。

Now, Shinji found himself in the entry plug of Unit 01, and had to force himself to pilot it, after he had been inside of it last time.  
现在，真嗣发现自己身处初号机的插入栓内，不得不强迫自己再次驾驶它，上次他在里面时的经历让他心有余悸。

'Relax,' he told himself. 'Just picture this as another synchronization test.' Then he remembered what had happened with the last test, and quickly abandoned that thought.  
'放松，'他对自己说。'就把这当成另一次同步测试吧。'随即他想起了上次测试发生的事情，迅速打消了这个念头。

Stepping onto the elevator that would take him to the surface, he glanced at Unit 00, and 02. All three of them were being sent up at different points. The exact spot that the angel would land was still being determined by Nerv computers. The idea was that, if they were sent up at all different points, either one of them would be able to reach the angel before it landed.  
踏进通往地面的电梯，他瞥了一眼零号机和二号机。他们三台机体将在不同时间点被送上去。天使的确切着陆点仍由 NERV 的计算机确定。计划是，如果他们从不同地点出发，那么至少有一台机体能在天使落地前到达。

Misato's voice suddenly came over the intercom, "We have determined the strike point of the target. Distance is 20,000 meters...Asuka you will be the nearest to the crash site. Be the first one there."  
美里突然通过对讲机传来指令，"我们已经确定了目标的打击点。距离为 20,000 米...明日香，你离坠落点最近。务必第一个到达。"

"I'd naturally be the first one there even if I wasn't the closest to it."  
"我自然会是第一个到达的，哪怕我不是离它最近的。"

Misato ignored her comment.  
美里无视了她的评论。

"Okay then...Unit 00 send up elevator shaft number one. Unit 01...elevator number five, and Unit 02...elevator shaft number three. Mission start!"  
"那么好吧...零号机使用一号电梯井。初号机...使用五号电梯，二号机...使用三号电梯井。任务开始！"

Feeling the familiar jerk behind his navel, Shinji rocket up several hundred feet before striking the surface. The umbilical cord immediately became detached and Shinji rocketed forward.  
感受到熟悉的腹部拉扯感，真嗣如火箭般冲上数百英尺，随后撞击在地面上。脐带电缆立即断开，真嗣疾速向前冲去。

He had never moved this fast while in Eva, and admittedly he was the furthest from the strike point. The feet of Unit 01 dug up such large quantities of dirt and debris, that it seemed as though its feet was one large shovel.  
他从未在 Eva 中移动得如此迅速，而且坦白说，他离撞击点最远。初号机的双脚掘起了大量泥土和碎片，仿佛它的双脚就是一把巨大的铲子。

Skidding to a sudden a halt, Unit 01 kicked off against the ground again, change it direction to the strike point. Soaring over power lines, shattering windows, sending cars flying. Shinji wondered how much they were really saving the city. Surely it costed millions if not billions of dollars to repair everything that they destroy during an angel attack.  
突然急停后，初号机再次蹬地，改变方向朝撞击点冲去。飞越电线，击碎窗户，将汽车抛向空中。真嗣不禁思考，他们究竟为这座城市节省了多少。毫无疑问，每次使徒袭击造成的破坏，修复费用高达数百万甚至数十亿美元。

As Shinji got closer to the strike point he looked up at the sky and finally saw the angel. It looked like a giant eye, but with wings...or feathers? Shinji wasn't really sure what was the better description. However his thoughts were suddenly shoved aside as he heard Misato's worried voice on the intercom.  
当真嗣接近攻击点时，他抬头望向天空，终于看到了那个使徒。它看起来像一只巨大的眼睛，但带着翅膀...还是羽毛？真嗣不太确定哪种描述更贴切。然而，他的思绪突然被通讯器中传来的美里担忧的声音打断。

"Targets position has been revised, change point to five kilometer east of its original position.  
目标位置已修正，变更点为其原位置以东五公里。

"Not good! I won't be able to make it in time!" Asuka yelled over the intercom.  
不好了！我来不及赶到了！"明日香在通讯器中喊道。

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

"...I can make it. Give me the position, Misato."  
"...我可以做到的。把位置给我，美里。"

With the coordinates relayed, Unit 01 took off at an amazing speed, creating a jet stream behind itself.  
坐标传送完毕后，零一号机以惊人的速度起飞，身后留下一道喷射流。

Shinji could now definitely see that the angel had changed its position, but was still worried that he might no be able to make it.  
真嗣现在可以肯定天使改变了位置，但仍然担心自己可能无法及时赶到。

Putting on another burst of speed, Shinji ripped through the pavement of Tokyo-3, no longer carrying about the power lines. Wild life and even trees seemed to serve out of his way, as he crossed a mountain and entered the East side of Tokyo-3.  
再次加速，真嗣撕裂了东京-3 的地面，不再顾及电线。野生动物甚至树木似乎都为他让路，他翻越了一座山，进入了东京-3 的东侧。

Skidding down the face of the mountain, he had Unit 01 dig its heels into the ground, slowing it down quickly. Now Shinji could almost see directly underneath the angel and knew that he was almost at the crash site.  
沿着山坡滑下，他让初号机将脚跟插入地面，迅速减速。现在真嗣几乎能直接看到天使的下方，知道他快到坠落地点了。

Slamming to a sudden halt, he looked directly up into the eye of the angel and saw a brief flash of orange before the angel created an AT-field. Mimicking its movements he shouted, "AT-field. Full power!"  
突然停下，他直视着天使的眼睛，看到一瞬间的橙色闪光，随后天使展开了 AT 力场。模仿其动作，他大喊：“AT 力场，全功率！”

The ground beneath Unit 01 crumbled and flew into the air before being disintegrated by the clash of the two AT-fields. A large shockwave went flying in all directions, ripping apart the foundations of nearby buildings, and taring the roots of trees out of the ground.  
初号机脚下的地面崩裂，碎石在两股 AT 力场的碰撞中化为齑粉。一股强大的冲击波向四周扩散，摧毁了附近建筑的地基，连根拔起了地面上的树木。

Shinji could feel that he was being pushed to the ground though, and confirmed this thought as he felt one of Unit 01 legs collapse and go kneeling to the ground. Feeling a sudden pain shoot through his own legs, he hoped that he his bones didn't just snap in two also.  
尽管如此，真嗣能感觉到自己被压倒在地，当看到初号机的一条腿跪下时，他确认了这一点。突然间，他感到腿部一阵剧痛，希望自己的骨头没有因此断裂。

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

Asuka came flying into view from the West, before standing next to Shinji and projecting her own AT-field, effectively enabling him to stand up again.  
明日香从西边飞驰而来，站在真嗣旁边，展开自己的 AT 力场，帮助他重新站立起来。

"You idiot, don't go killing yourself before I get here."  
"你这个白痴，别在我到之前就把自己搞死了。"

"Forget it and just concentrate."  
"别想了，专心点。"

"Don't tell me what to-"  
"别命令我——"

Her words were silenced as the angel gave a large jolt, and propelled itself closer to the ground. Both Eva's sank to there knees suddenly and Shinji felt pain in his legs again.  
天使猛地一震，加速向地面靠近，两人的话语戛然而止。伊娃们突然跪倒在地，真嗣再次感到双腿剧痛。

"Damn it!" Yelled Asuka. "Where is the pet!"  
“该死！”明日香大喊，“那宠物在哪儿！”

"Ikari-kun..." “碇君……”

Unit 01 with Rei came in from the North before standing on Shinji's left, projecting her own AT-field. The combination of the three sent the angel reeling backwards for a second, before rightening itself and continuing the assault  
01 号机与绫波从北方赶来，站在真嗣左侧，展开了自己的 AT 力场。三者的合力让使徒一时后退，随即又稳住身形，继续攻击。

"So where all here...now what!"  
“所以大家都到齐了……接下来怎么办！”

"One of us has to destroy this thing while the other two give them a window to attack."  
“我们中必须有人摧毁这东西，而另外两人则提供攻击的窗口。”

"Okay you two do that. I'm gonna destroy this thing."  
"好了，你们俩继续。我要毁了这玩意儿。"

"No, I'm doing it," Shinji yelled back at Asuka.  
"不，我来干，" 真嗣对明日香吼道。"

"Who the fuck decided on that!"  
"谁他妈决定的那个！"

"Just hurry...already..."  
"快点...已经..."

Shinji thought he heard a strain in Rei's voice. He hadn't considered her thoughts.  
真嗣觉得他听出了丽声音中的一丝紧张。他之前没有考虑过她的想法。

"Asuka just let me do this!"  
"明日香，就让我这么做吧！"

"Damn it! If you die I'll swear on your fucking grave that I said I'd do it."  
"该死！如果你死了，我发誓会在你的坟头上说我已经尽力了。"

'I'll remember that..." '我会记住的..."

Releasing the AT-field for no more than a few seconds, Shinji gave Asuka and Rei more than enough time to carrying out there own steps.  
仅释放 AT 力场几秒钟，真嗣给了明日香和丽足够的时间来执行他们各自的步骤。

Separating the one AT-field into two different ones, Asuka and Rei slammed the two AT-fields into the angels, both focusing on a different part. The angel was forced to focus on separate points in the AT-field, moving the brunt of its power to the points that Asuka and Rei were working on, making the dead center weak.  
将一个 AT 力场分割成两个不同的部分，明日香和绫波同时将这两个 AT 力场猛击向使徒，各自集中攻击不同的部位。使徒被迫在 AT 力场上分散注意力，将大部分力量转移到明日香和绫波攻击的点上，使得中心区域变得薄弱。

Disengaging both their AT-fields simultaneously, Asuka and Rei created one large one, and wrenched open a hole in the dead center of the angels before it was able to react.  
明日香和绫波同时解除各自的 AT 力场，创造出一个巨大的力场，并在使徒反应过来之前，在中心区域撕开了一个洞。

Shinji moved suddenly to that with a flash of scarlet in his eyes.  
真嗣突然行动起来，眼中闪过一抹猩红。

Meanwhile, in the command center, Ritsuko showed Misato something confusing just before Shinji started his attack.  
与此同时，在指挥中心，律子在真嗣发起攻击前向美里展示了一些令人困惑的东西。

"Misato...you might want to see this..."  
“美里……你或许该看看这个……”

"What?" "什么？"

As Misato walked over to the computer she glanced at the monitor of the Eva's exactly thirty-seconds remained in the activation period. 'It should be enough time,' she thought.  
当美里走向电脑时，她瞥了一眼 EVA 的监控屏幕，激活期还剩三十秒。‘应该足够了，’她心想。

As she reached the monitor Ritsuko was examining though, everything else left her mind, and she realized the danger in the numbers.  
当她走到丽津子正在检查的监视器前时，其他一切都从她脑海中消失了，她意识到了数字中的危险。

"This was the recorded plug depth during the last synchronization test of Unit 01, which was unusually high at the time."  
“这是零一机在上次同步测试中记录的插入深度，当时异常偏高。”

The number read sixty. 数字显示为六十。

"This is the current number...and its still climbing."  
"这是当前的数字...还在不断上升。"

The number read eighty. 数字显示为八十。

"...Shinji's entering the contamination zone...but why? Is he choosing to on his own?"  
"...真嗣进入了污染区...但为什么？是他自己选择的吗？"

"Its the only reason that I can understand."  
"这是我能理解的唯一理由。"

"But why? There's no reason for doing something like this. If he continues on he wont remain-"  
"但为什么？这样做毫无理由。如果他继续下去，他将不再——"

"-human," asked Ritsuko with no expression on her face.  
"——保持人性，" 赤城瑞穗面无表情地问道。"

Misato frowned heavily at Ritsuko. Did she know something that she didn't know about Shinji?  
美里皱着眉头看向律子。她是不是知道一些自己不了解的关于真嗣的事情？

Back at the battle, Shinji had just disengaged his attack as Asuka and Rei rushed in. If it had to be someone...it might as well be him.  
回到战场，真嗣刚刚解除攻击，明日香和绫波就冲了进来。如果非得是某个人...那还不如是他。

'An angels AT-field is an extension of itself, and if my body is an extension of the Eva's...then does that mean that I have an AT-field? Do all humans have an AT-field that lets them distinguish themselves from other humans?' For some strange reason he thought he has had a similar discussion like this before.  
'使徒的 AT 力场是其自身的延伸，如果我的身体是 EVA 的延伸...那么这是否意味着我也有 AT 力场？所有人类是否都有 AT 力场，让他们能够区分自己和其他人？'出于某种奇怪的原因，他觉得自己以前似乎有过类似的讨论。

His eyes flashed scarlet for a brief moment as he thought this and briefly sensed a changed in the LCL fluid in the entry plug. It became more dense, like it actually had a definable substance.  
他的眼中闪过一瞬猩红，心中思绪涌动，同时察觉到插入栓内 LCL 液体的变化。它变得更加浓稠，仿佛真的有了可辨认的实体。

Looking up he quickly caught Unit 00 and 02 movements and reacted instinctively at that.  
他抬头迅速捕捉到零号机和二号机的动作，本能地做出了反应。

Shoving one arm of the Eva up to its elbow, into the small window that he Asuka and Rei managed to create, he projected a large cone that covered everything from the Eva's elbow and below to the tips of its fingers.  
他将 EVA 的一只手臂推至肘部，伸入他与明日香和绫波共同创造的小窗口，投射出一个巨大的锥形屏障，覆盖了 EVA 肘部以下至指尖的所有部位。

Forcing the AT-field open was only the first part. Next, Shinji put all of his thought into widening the cone like AT-field and separating the angel in half. He got about as far as that when a new AT-field of the angels suddenly slammed into the cone like one, shattering it instantly.  
强行打开 AT 力场只是第一步。接下来，真嗣全神贯注地试图扩大锥形 AT 力场，将使徒一分为二。然而就在此时，使徒突然释放出新的 AT 力场，猛烈撞击锥形力场，瞬间将其击碎。

Unit 01 went stumbling backwards as Shinji screamed in pain as he felt the ends of the Eva's fingers snap.  
初号机踉跄后退，真嗣痛苦地尖叫，他感觉到 EVA 手指的末端断裂了。

Asuka and Rei rushed forward but were sent kneeling to the ground as the full might up the angels AT-field was sent crashing down on top of them.  
明日香和绫波丽冲上前去，却被使徒 AT 力场的全力压制击倒在地，跪了下来。

As Shinji looked back at the angel, hopelessness started to settle in the bottom of his stomach. Could they even win against something this powerful? Would it even matter? Surely another stronger angel was sure to come after this one and they be facing the same problem.  
当真嗣回头看向天使时，绝望感开始在他的胃底蔓延。他们能战胜如此强大的存在吗？这真的重要吗？肯定会有更强大的天使紧随其后，他们将再次面临同样的困境。

"Shinji, what the fuck do you think you're doing!"  
“真嗣，你他妈以为自己在干什么！”

Asuka's mad voice seemed wake him up and he blinked his eyes open as he saw Unit 00 and 02 go crashing to their knees. He could see the veins around the Eva's arms and knew that the contamination had started.  
明日香愤怒的声音似乎唤醒了他，他眨眼睁开眼睛，看到零号机和二号机轰然跪地。他能看到 EVA 手臂上的青筋，知道污染已经开始。

But what was he supposed to-  
但他到底应该怎么做——

"Shinji damn it! You said you could handle this, so back your fucking words up with your actions."  
"真嗣，该死！你说过你能处理好这件事的，那就用行动来证明你的话。"

...She was right. What was he doing? He said he would handle it and now he was running away. Just like he had done with everything else in his life.  
...她说得对。他在做什么？他曾说他能处理好，现在却在逃避。就像他一生中对待其他所有事情一样。

As Asuka and Rei were tossed aside, Shinji's eyes turned to the color of blood red.  
当明日香和绫波被甩到一旁时，真嗣的眼睛变成了血红色。

The plug depth had just passed one hundred.  
插入栓深度刚刚超过一百。

Rushing forward, Shinji slid underneath the angel and extended both the Eva's arms and projected a dome like AT-field over himself, the other two, and all within a two kilometer radius.  
真嗣冲向前，滑到使徒下方，同时伸展 EVA 的双臂，并在自己、另外两人以及两公里半径内的所有人上方投射出一个穹顶状的 AT 力场。

The angel stopped dead in its tracks and jolted backwards for a second. Following up on his initial attack, Shinji forcefully created another AT-field, separate from the first one, and opened up a small hole at the top of the dome like first AT-field. Just by thinking it, he was now able to achieve what he wanted.  
天使突然停下脚步，猛地向后一震。紧随其后的攻击中，真嗣强行创造出另一个 AT 力场，与第一个分开，并在其穹顶顶部打开一个小洞。只需一想，他便能达成所愿。

Forming it into a small spherical shape, he sent it flying straight through the hole that he had made moments before, ripping apart the outer layer of flesh of the angel. A small trickle of blood started to flow out of the wound that the angel had suffered. But why should it worry about something so minuscule.  
将其塑成一个小球状，他让它直穿之前制造的洞口，撕裂了天使的外层肉体。一丝鲜血开始从天使受创的伤口流出。但为何要为如此微不足道的事担忧。

Next second a large chunk of the angels flesh was blown away, as the spherical AT-field erupted inside of it. Blood and organs slithered out of the open wound, painting the streets and buildings of Tokyo-3 scarlet. If the angel had a voice, Shinji was sure that it would be shrieking in agony.  
下一秒，天使的一大块肉被球形 AT 力场在其内部引爆而炸飞。血液和内脏从敞开的伤口中滑出，将东京-3 的街道和建筑染成猩红。如果天使有声音，真嗣确信它会发出痛苦的尖叫。

Before it was able to regenerate, Shinji slammed Unit 01's hand into the bloody pocket of flesh and blood that he had created moments before. And created the cone like AT-field that he had original tried, except now it was as large as the angel.  
在它能够再生之前，真嗣将初号机的手猛地插入他刚刚制造的血肉模糊的口袋中。他尝试着创造了一个锥形 AT 力场，只是这次它的规模与使徒相当。

Tendons, nerves, and tissue were able to be seen as the angel split in two separate part, before exploding in a large burst of blood and gore. Shinji felt the wave of gore engulf him, as it flew in all directions, turning Unit 01 into colors suitable for Unit 02.  
肌腱、神经和组织清晰可见，使徒被分成了两部分，随后爆炸成一大片血肉横飞。真嗣感到血肉浪潮将他吞没，向四面八方飞溅，将初号机染成了适合二号机的颜色。

Breathing heavily, he looked at the sea of gore splashed in all direction and finally knew that it was over. But what happened exactly?  
他喘着粗气，看着四处飞溅的血海，终于明白一切都结束了。但究竟发生了什么？

His eyes were back to there usual brown color.  
他的眼睛又恢复了平常的棕色。

...Had he done this? If he had to describe it, it looked like something out of a very gory slasher film. He could remember watching it, but it felt like he had been seeing it all from a third perspective. What had he done? He remembered Asuka yelling at him...and then what? He had moved with such ease that it felt as though it were floating. He thought what he wanted, and it happened. But then...the two AT-fields. Had he created one of those himself? Was it because of being inside Unit 01 that he was able to? Maybe an Eva was able to generate two AT-fields...  
...这是他做的吗？如果要形容的话，这场景就像是从一部非常血腥的恐怖片里出来的。他记得自己看过，但感觉像是用第三者的视角在看。他到底做了什么？他记得明日香对他大喊...然后呢？他移动得如此轻松，仿佛在漂浮。他想什么，什么就发生了。但之后...那两个 AT 力场。是他自己创造了一个吗？是因为他在零一机体内才能做到的吗？或许一台 EVA 能产生两个 AT 力场...

"I don't...know..." “我不...知道...”

What the fuck was happening to him?  
他妈的到底发生了什么？

"...Shinji..." "...真嗣..."

"I don't know damn it. Leave me alone already..."  
"我不知道，该死的。别管我了..."

"Ikari-kun?" "碇君？"

"Don't talk to me! I don't want to talk to anyone! Just leave me alone!"  
"别跟我说话！我不想和任何人说话！让我一个人待着！"

"Shinji, wake the fuck up!"  
"真嗣，醒醒吧！"

Shinji opened his eyes. He was crying.  
真嗣睁开了眼睛。他在哭泣。

"...You defeated it...its gone..."  
“……你打败了它……它消失了……”

Why was he crying? 他为何在哭泣？

"You can stop now!" "你可以停下了！"

Why should he be crying over something so insignificant?  
他为何要为如此微不足道的事情哭泣？

"Stop destroying what remains of it damn it!"  
"别再毁掉它仅存的部分了，该死！"

Why the fuck should he be crying over the remains of an angel!  
他妈的为什么要为天使的遗骸哭泣！

Tears streaked down his face as he repeatedly pummeled and tore apart the bones and organs of what remained of the angel.  
泪水顺着他的脸颊滑落，他不断地捶打并撕扯着天使残存的骨头和器官。

'Why am I crying?' He wondered. 'I should be glad that this is over, not sad. I could have died. Everyone could have died. Yet why the fuck am I crying over an angels corpse!'  
‘我为什么在哭？’他疑惑着。‘我应该为这一切结束而高兴，而不是悲伤。我本可能死去。所有人本可能死去。可他妈的为什么我要为一个天使的尸体哭泣！’

"Shinji enough already," said Misato over the intercom.  
“真嗣，够了，”美里通过对讲机说道。

"Cut all power and synchronization between Unit 01 and the pilot. If this continues on he may be permanently contaminated," said Ritsuko.  
“切断零号机与驾驶员之间所有的电源和同步连接。如果这种情况继续下去，他可能会永久性地受到污染，”律子说道。

Shinji suddenly felt Unit 01 shudder violent, and everything went black.  
真嗣突然感觉到零号机剧烈颤抖，随后一切陷入黑暗。

---

Yet...everything was still black...  
然而...一切仍是漆黑一片...

Wait, no, that wasn't quite right. A light was coming from behind him, and a very bright light at that.  
等等，不对，情况并非完全如此。一束光线正从他身后射来，而且是非常明亮的光。

The room slowly came into focus and Shinji started to become aware of his surroundings. He was laying down on the couch in Misato's apartment, and seemed to be tucked warmly under a blanket while a pillow was propped behind his head.  
房间渐渐清晰起来，真嗣开始意识到周围的环境。他正躺在美里公寓的沙发上，身上盖着温暖的毯子，头下还垫着一个枕头。

Sitting up slowly, he winced as pain shot through his fingers and knees, though it wasn't as bad as he might have expected.  
他缓缓坐起身，当疼痛穿过手指和膝盖时，他皱了皱眉，但并没有他预想的那么糟糕。

Looking around the first things that he recognize was that: The T.V. was on and muted, second: Asuka was sitting in a chair that looked to be from the kitchen, and facing the T.V. Though she certainly didn't seem to be awake In fact, her head was drooping off to the side a little.  
环顾四周，他首先注意到的是：电视开着但静音了，其次：明日香坐在一把看起来像是厨房用的椅子上，面朝电视。不过她显然没有醒着，事实上，她的头微微偏向一侧，垂了下来。

Even though the lighting was a bit weak, Shinji was still able to see Asuka's beautiful face as she slept with a smile on her face. He then noticed that no matter what her face looked like, it seemed that she had spent several anxious hours sitting on that chair. Her hair was a disheveled mess, while the baggy shirt she was wearing was hanging halfway down one of her shoulders, enabling Shinji to see the white bra strap underneath. He had a sudden strange urge to lean over and tuck a locket of her hair behind her ear.  
尽管光线有些昏暗，真嗣仍能清晰地看到明日香熟睡时美丽的脸庞上带着微笑。随后他注意到，无论她的脸庞如何，她似乎已经在那把椅子上焦虑地坐了几个小时。她的头发凌乱不堪，而她穿着的那件宽松衬衫半边滑落，露出了下面的白色胸罩带。他突然有种奇怪的冲动，想俯身将她的一缕头发撩到耳后。

'...Where the hell did that come from?' He wondered.  
“……这他妈是从哪儿冒出来的？”他疑惑道。

Sitting up more promptly he looked around the room a few more times, (his gaze resting on Asuka several times) before he looked down at his own hands. Why did he feel so...revolted? Was it because of his thoughts earlier, of how it might have been possible to _save_ the angel. Had anybody ever thought that it was just one giant misunderstanding between the human race and the angel? Of course not, because it was, 'they exist and are evil. We exist and are righteous.' The thought made him sick.  
他更加迅速地坐起身，环顾房间几次（目光多次停留在明日香身上），然后低头看着自己的双手。为何他感到如此……厌恶？是因为他早先的想法吗，关于如何可能拯救那位天使。是否有人曾想过，这不过是人类与天使之间的一个巨大误会？当然没有，因为这是，“它们存在且邪恶。我们存在且正义。”这个念头让他感到恶心。

Sinking back down into the couch cushions he turned his head towards Asuka, only to receive a shocking revelation that her eyes were open, and her forehead was pressed lightly against his. She didn't look to thrilled though to see him awake.  
他重新陷进沙发垫里，转头看向明日香，却震惊地发现她的眼睛是睁开的，额头轻轻贴着他的。不过，看到他醒来，她似乎并不怎么高兴。

"...Ahh...hey Asu-" "...啊...嘿，阿苏-"

"FUCKING MORON!" "蠢货！"

Shinji received a hard jab to his ribcage and doubled over in pain. What the hell had he done to deserve this?  
真嗣的肋骨被狠狠一击，痛得弯下了腰。他到底做了什么要受这种罪？

"Bastard! Ass-hole! You've been completely unconscious for over a day and you just sit up and say hey?"  
"混蛋！王八蛋！你已经完全昏迷超过一天了，刚一醒过来就打个招呼？"

"...Over a day?" "...超过一天？"

"Yes over a day you fucking idiot. I've left this chair for two reasons, one: to go to the bathroom, and two: to get food and bring it back here. My eyes are blood shot from watching T.V. and jerking around every time you mumbled in your sleep or changed your body positions. Do you have any idea how stressed out I am right now!  
"是的，超过一天，你这个该死的白痴。我离开这椅子只有两个原因，一是去洗手间，二是去弄点吃的带回来。我的眼睛因为看电视和每次你睡觉时嘟囔或改变姿势而紧张得充血。你知道我现在有多紧张吗！"

"No...but I think my ribs do."  
"不...但我觉得我的肋骨可能断了。"

"I swear to God, I am going to beat you within an inch of your life, spare you, and then repeat the same thing over the next day."  
"我向上帝发誓，我会把你打到只剩一口气，饶你一命，然后第二天再重复一遍。"

"I don't think my body will hold up even after one day."  
"我觉得我的身体连一天都撑不住。"

"I've slept an entire two fucking hours since yesterday!"  
"从昨天起我就他妈的只睡了整整两个小时！"

"I'm still trying to wrap my mind around the fact that I did nothing but sleep for an entire day."  
"我还在努力接受我一整天什么都没干，光睡觉了这个事实。"

"I wouldn't call it sleeping so much as a coma. We weren't sure if you had been contaminated or not."  
"与其说是睡觉，不如说是昏迷。我们当时不确定你是否被污染了。"

"Well I'm fine, so you don't have to get so anxious."  
"好吧，我没事，所以你不必这么焦虑。"

"Do you even care how I felt?"  
"你有没有在乎过我的感受？"

"Course I do. But I'm fine so I don't see a need to overreact-"  
"当然在乎。但我没事，所以我觉得没必要反应过度——"

"Overreact? This is normal! Anybody would have been worried about someone that-"  
"反应过度？这很正常！任何人都会担心那个——"

"-means a lot to you?"  
"——对你意义重大的人？"

Asuka paused for a minute, before taking in a deep breath and saying, "Yes...okay. You mean a lot to me, damn it."  
明日香顿了一下，深吸一口气后说道，“是的...好吧。你对我来说意义重大，该死。”

"And you mean a lot to me too Asuka."  
"你对我也很重要，明日香。"

The sharp intake of breath was all Shinji need to know that Asuka had heard him correctly. But God was he feeling tired again.  
那一瞬间的深吸气足以让真嗣知道明日香听清楚了他的话。但天啊，他又感到疲惫了。

"Hey Asuka..." "嘿，明日香……"

"What?" "什么？"

"...Thanks." "...谢谢。"

"Whatever...at least I can sleep better tonight since I know you haven't turned into a corpse."  
"随便吧...至少我知道你还没变成尸体，今晚能睡个好觉了。"

"Speaking of sleep, I feel tired again."  
"说到睡觉，我又感觉累了。"

"What? You just slept for an entire day. How can you still be tired?"  
"什么？你已经睡了一整天了。怎么还会累呢？"

"Well it is night so its natural that I'd sleep."  
"嗯，现在是晚上，自然会想睡觉。"

"I suppose. Well, I'm sleeping in my room tonight. That chair gives me back pains."  
"我想也是。好吧，今晚我要睡在我的房间里。那把椅子让我背疼。"

Asuka turned to get up, when Shinji grabbed ahold of her wrist."  
明日香转过身准备起身，这时真嗣抓住了她的手腕。

"Wha-" "什-"

"Stay here for a while..."  
“在这里待一会儿吧……”

Asuka's face flushed pink for a second before turning back to its usual color.  
明日香的脸颊瞬间泛起粉红，随后又恢复了平常的颜色。

"Fine," she sighed. "But only for a little while. I want to sleep properly tonight."  
"好吧，"她叹了口气。"但只能一会儿。我今晚想好好睡一觉。"

"Hmm. Okay." "嗯，好吧。"

Shifting into a more comfortable position, Shinji looked at his hands once more before turning to Asuka and holding out the hand closest to the edge of the couch.  
调整到一个更舒适的姿势，真嗣再次看着自己的手，然后转向明日香，伸出离沙发边缘最近的那只手。

Raising an eyebrow, Asuka said, "What?"  
明日香挑了挑眉，问道："什么？"

"...Just hold my hand for a while."  
"...就握一会儿我的手吧。"

"...You sound like a child...but all right, whatever."  
"...你听起来像个孩子...不过好吧，随你。"

Grabbing Shinji's hand none to gently she frowned down at it for a minute before deciding where to place it. Cupping his hand in both of hers, she gently rested them on her lap.  
她不太温柔地抓住真嗣的手，皱着眉头看了一会儿，然后决定把它放在哪里。她用双手捧着他的手，轻轻地放在自己的腿上。

Neither of them moved from that spot that night, and yet, she was still able to get a good nights rest.  
那一夜，他们谁也没有离开那个地方，然而，她依然能够安然入睡。

### Chapter 12: Hurtful Changes

**Thanks for everyone patience while they waited for this. I woke up at 10 when my alarm hit...but ended up sleeping for another three hours. There was no possible way to get it out till now. Also this has not been proofread in anyway so don't be surprised if you see missing words. I'm gonna fix it tomorrow, but in a minute I'm going to sleep. (I think I actually caught a cold doing a double post and I got it done in four days)  
感谢大家的耐心等待。我十点被闹钟叫醒...结果又睡了三个小时。直到现在才有可能发布。此外，这还没有经过任何校对，所以如果看到遗漏的词，请不要惊讶。我明天会修正，但现在我得去睡觉了。（我觉得我因为连续发帖真的感冒了，而且我四天内完成了它）**

**So...this chapter is a very heavy M and I actually cut some stuff out because, quite frankly, I thought the possibility of it being too graphic would get it taken down. With that out of the way this chapter contains...well you can read and find out. At one point I will have a disclaimer though so people can skip that part if they want to. Just look for the bold letters at the beginning at end of the section. I'll give a very brief cap of what happened.  
所以...这一章是相当重的 M 级内容，实际上我删除了一些内容，因为坦白说，我认为过于露骨可能会导致被删除。说清楚这一点后，这一章包含...嗯，你可以阅读并发现。在某一点上，我会有一个免责声明，这样人们可以选择跳过那部分。只需寻找章节开头和结尾的粗体字。我会简要概述发生了什么。**

---

When Shinji woke up that morning, he had no idea that everything would from today onwards, would start to spiral out of control. If he had known the horror, traumatic event that he would eventually stop, things would have certainly changed. But most likely, in the end, his angels blood would have awoken anyway.  
那天早上，真嗣醒来时，完全不知道从今天开始，一切都将失控。如果他知道最终会阻止的恐怖、创伤性事件，情况肯定会改变。但很可能，最终他的天使之血还是会觉醒。

It was bright that morning, very bright. And yet, by the end of the day, the weather seemed to be foretelling a change in everything.  
那天早晨阳光明媚，非常明亮。然而，到了傍晚时分，天气似乎预示着一切都将发生变化。

Shinji woke early that morning, much earlier than he had nights before, and he could only attribute it to the coma like state that he had been in the past day. But he wasn't the only person up.  
那天早晨，真嗣醒得很早，比前几晚都要早，他只能将其归因于过去一天里他处于的那种昏迷般的状态。但他并不是唯一一个醒着的人。

Turning towards the chair that Asuka had fallen asleep on last night, he immediately registered that she was not sitting in it as it was vacant. Then he recalled the nights events. His last clear memory had been when he saw Asuka clasping her hands together, hiding his own somewhere in that warmth grasp. Had they fallen asleep like that?  
转向昨晚明日香睡着的那把椅子，他立刻注意到她不在那里，椅子是空的。然后他想起了昨晚的事件。他最后的清晰记忆是看到明日香双手紧握，将自己的手藏在那温暖的握持中。他们就这样睡着了吗？

When Shinji entered the kitchen, the last thing he expected was to have breakfast waiting for him on the table. Of course, thats what happened...  
当真嗣走进厨房时，他最没想到的是桌上已经为他准备好了早餐。当然，事情就是这样发生的……

Bacon, eggs, and two pieces of toast, ladled with butter and jam, was neatly set on the table waiting for him, with a napkin and fork and knife placed fittingly on either side of the plate.  
培根、鸡蛋，还有两片涂满黄油和果酱的吐司，整齐地摆放在桌上等待着他，餐盘两侧恰到好处地摆放着餐巾、叉子和刀。

As Shinji continued to stare at the plate of foot on the table, he heard the clearing of someones throat, and only then realize that he was not alone in the kitchen.  
当真嗣继续盯着桌上的那盘食物时，他听到了某人清嗓子的声音，这才意识到厨房里并非只有他一人。

Asuka was standing in front of the stove with a spatula in one hand, and an oven cooling mitten in the other. Whats more, she had dawned the white apron again, and Shinji felt butterflies in his stomach as his eyes roved over the way the apron clung perfectly to her developing curves.  
明日香站在炉子前，一手拿着铲子，另一手戴着隔热手套。更甚的是，她再次穿上了那件白色围裙，真嗣的目光不由自主地在她逐渐显露的曲线间游走，心中涌起一阵悸动。

"Are you gonna stand there all day gawking, or are you actually going to sit down and eat?"  
"你打算在那儿站一整天发呆，还是真的坐下来吃东西？"

"...Did you make all this?" Asked Shinji amazed.  
"...这些都是你做的吗？" 真嗣惊讶地问道。

"No, it was Misato. Sorry if I just ruined your appetite," said Asuka sarcastically.  
"不，是美里做的。抱歉如果我毁了你的胃口，" 明日香讽刺地说道。

"No, I'm just surprised that you would go to such lengths-"  
"不，我只是惊讶你会做到这种程度——"

"You didn't eat anything last night idiot. You should be starving."  
"你昨晚什么都没吃，傻瓜。你应该饿坏了。"

As if an answer to her words, Shinji's stomach gave a loud rumble. It sounded sorta like a dog barking at a fence.  
仿佛是对她话语的回应，真嗣的肚子发出了一阵响亮的咕噜声。听起来有点像狗对着栅栏吠叫。

His face flushed slightly from embarrassed, Shinji gave a word of thanks, before sitting down and digging into his breakfast. Predictably, it was good.  
他的脸因尴尬而微微泛红，真嗣道了声谢，随即坐下开始享用早餐。不出所料，味道很不错。

"So? What are we supposed to be doing today?" Said Shinji between mouthfuls.  
“那么？我们今天应该做些什么呢？”真嗣边吃边问。

Sitting down across from him, with a with a piece of toast in her hand, Asuka said, "_You_ aren't doing anything except staying here. I have to go to school in a minute, but you will be staying home, resting, and doing past homework."  
坐在他对面，手里拿着一片吐司的明日香说道：“你除了待在这里什么也不用做。我一会儿得去上学，但你得留在家里休息，完成之前的作业。”

"Wouldn't it make more sense to go to school instead of skipping another day?"  
"去学校不是比再翘一天更有意义吗？"

"You're staying here, no questions!"  
"你留在这里，不许问问题！"

"Okay, okay, fine. ...Where is Misato, anyway?"  
"好吧，好吧，行。……话说，美里在哪里？"

"No clue. She was gone when I woke up. Probably at Nerv, as usual."  
"不知道。我醒来时她已经不见了。大概又像往常一样去了 Nerv 吧。"

"...I suppose." "……我想也是。"

Tossing the last piece of toast in her mouth, Asuka said, "You do the dishes since I made breakfast."  
阿斯卡将最后一片吐司塞进嘴里，说道：“你洗碗，因为我做了早餐。”

"Hmm, deal." "嗯，成交。"

Several minutes later, Asuka was fully dressed with a bento in her hand that Shinji had hurriedly made out of the remaining ingredients in the fridge. He was wearing the white apron that Asuka had on earlier and could still notice a faint trace of the flowery scent of her hair lingering on the fabric.  
几分钟后，明日香已经穿戴整齐，手里拿着一个便当，这是真嗣用冰箱里剩下的食材匆忙做成的。他穿着明日香之前穿过的白色围裙，还能闻到围裙上残留的淡淡花香，那是她头发的香味。

"I'm most likely stopping downtown after school for somethings."  
"放学后我可能会在市区停一下，买点东西。"

"Do you want to meet somewhere after school gets out?"  
"放学后你想在哪儿见面吗？"

"No, its fine. I can manage by myself."  
"不用，我一个人能行。"

As Asuka turned to leave, Shinji suddenly wanted to say something to her. Like...a reassurance of some kind, that everything was fine. Instead, he brought one arm around and rested it just below her neck line, brushing lightly against her breasts as he did so, while he wrapped his other arm just above her waist.  
当明日香转身离开时，真嗣突然想对她说些什么。像是...某种安慰，告诉她一切都会好起来的。然而，他伸出一只手臂，轻轻搭在她的颈线下方，不经意间触碰到她的胸部，同时另一只手臂环抱在她腰际上方。

Asuka was silent as Shinji showed this strange array of affection. What was she feeling? Comfort? Longing? ...Love? Heaven forbid it couldn't be this last one.  
看着真嗣展现出这一连串奇异的情感，明日香沉默了。她此刻是什么感觉？安慰？渴望？……爱？天哪，千万别是最后这个。

"Shinji," she said somewhat weakly. Oh God why did her knees have to wobble now?  
“真嗣，”她有些无力地说道。哦，天啊，为什么她的膝盖现在要发软？

"Hmmm, Asuka?" “嗯，明日香？”

"Would you mind letting go of me?"  
"你能放开我吗？"

The tender moment which had started abruptly was shattered in the same way with Asuka's cold statement. It wasn't that she hated his silent gesture...she just...didn't know how she was supposed to react to something like that. She had never felt the warmth from another human being such as she felt from Shinji in these brief seconds when their bodies meshed together.  
这个突如其来的温柔瞬间被明日香冷冰冰的话语打破。并不是她讨厌他无声的举动……她只是……不知道该如何回应这样的事情。她从未在如此短暂的几秒钟内，从真嗣的身体接触中感受到来自另一个人的温暖。

"Sorry...I should go..." "对不起……我该走了……"

"Hmm. Cya later then." "嗯，那待会儿见。"

"Yeah...bye Shinji." "是啊...再见，真嗣。"

It sounded as though they'd never see each other again.  
听起来好像他们再也不会见面了。

---

With school out, Asuka found herself walking through some of the more expensive shops and malls of Tokyo-3. She had originally planed to pick up some groceries for Shinji to cook with tonight, but found herself getting side tracked every time she looked into a stores window.  
学校放假了，明日香发现自己漫步在东京-3 一些更为昂贵的商店和购物中心。她原本计划为真嗣今晚做饭买些食材，但每次往商店橱窗里看时，她都会分心。

Now though her thoughts wandered back to Misato's apartment, where Shinji currently was, and what had happened this morning  
然而现在，她的思绪飘回了美里小姐的公寓，真嗣目前所在的地方，以及今早发生的事情。

What would happen if she searched her heart throughly and honestly? What would she realize? And furthermore was it even reasonable to think about that?  
如果她彻底而诚实地审视自己的内心，她会发现什么？她会意识到什么？更重要的是，思考这些是否合理？

She realized that she had been stationary in front of a shopping window for at least a minute, thinking about all these things. Love was...something that she had never considered giving even a brief thought to. Before, she had been happy enough piloting Eva and receiving praise for her high synchronization scores. But why did she pilot now? Why did she pilot in the first place? But...no, that was something that she refused to think about. Her logic at the time had seemed convincing enough, and the benefits certainly outweighed the dangers. But that was more than two years ago that she had decided to follow the path as an Eva pilot. Now what? Had anything changed? Yes, things had...many things. Shinji had entered her life.  
她意识到自己已在一家商店橱窗前驻足至少一分钟，思绪纷飞。爱情，是她从未考虑过要稍加思索的事物。从前，她驾驶 Eva 并因高同步率得分而受到赞誉，便已心满意足。但如今她为何还要驾驶？最初又是为何选择这条路？然而……不，她拒绝深思。当时的逻辑似乎足够有说服力，利益显然大于风险。但那已是两年多前，她决定成为 Eva 驾驶员的时刻。现在呢？是否有所改变？是的，许多事情变了……真嗣走进了她的生活。

Why did everything return to him? What would have happened if she had been transferred somewhere else? Would her life have changed at all? Well, maybe a little. But not to the point where she was having second thoughts now that she was so far down the road. Its not like she could turn back and choose a different route. She was smart, incredibly smart for that matter, and yet...so weak at heart. She was smart enough to see this problem within herself, though never acknowledging it until now. Was it his fault that she felt weak? Well, maybe it was, when her legs got weak when she saw him smiling at her, but certainly not for the reason she was thinking of.  
为什么一切又回到了他身上？如果她被调到别的地方会发生什么？她的生活会有所改变吗？嗯，也许会有一点。但不会到她现在走了这么远的路却开始犹豫不决的地步。她不可能回头选择另一条路。她很聪明，事实上非常聪明，然而...内心却如此脆弱。她足够聪明，能看到自己内心的这个问题，尽管直到现在才承认。她感到软弱是他的错吗？嗯，也许是的，当她看到他向她微笑时，她的腿就软了，但这绝不是她所想的原因。

Eva made her feel fearless, because nothing could get her while she was enclosed in the small suffocating space. Did she honestly enjoy it though? It took her a minute to think of this, but the answer was still a negative. How could anyone honestly enjoy piloting an Evangelion? She had done so because she didn't see another choice. To fill that weakness, she had thrown every other prospect that she had been offered during college, and for what?  
伊娃让她感到无所畏惧，因为在那个狭小窒息的空间里，没有什么能伤害到她。但她真的喜欢这样吗？她花了一分钟思考这个问题，但答案仍然是否定的。有谁能真心喜欢驾驶福音战士呢？她这么做是因为她没有看到其他选择。为了填补那个弱点，她放弃了大学期间被提供的所有其他机会，又是为了什么呢？

She could feel the pieces falling apart even as she thought about them. Shinji had slowly chipped away at the concrete wall that she had formed in her heart. She felt that every time she even talked to him, another piece was chipped away. But it wasn't so bad...she had even made friends through him.  
她能感觉到那些碎片正在崩解，即便是在思考它们的时候。真嗣慢慢地敲碎了她心中筑起的那堵混凝土墙。她觉得每次只要和他交谈，就会有一块碎片被敲落。但这并不糟糕...她甚至通过他交到了朋友。

She had never had any friends when she was younger...her father had made sure of that. She knew that her personality was...difficult to get along with, but that was just who she was. If people didn't like who she was, then they should just get the fuck out of her way. Shinji had accepted that she could be overbearing and possibly a bitch at times, but he still accepted that part of her.  
她小时候从未有过朋友...父亲确保了这一点。她知道自己的性格...难以相处，但那就是她。如果人们不喜欢她，那就应该滚开。真嗣接受了她可能霸道且有时是个泼妇的事实，但他依然接纳了她的这一面。

'How long have I been standing here?' She suddenly wondered, as it had been a very long time since she moved a muscle in either direction. She was still starring at the exact same glass pane.  
'我站在这里多久了？'她突然疑惑起来，因为她已经很久没有动弹了。她仍然盯着那块完全相同的玻璃窗。

'Did I even have a reason to look at this store?' She thought. 'I haven't even gotten any groceries and-,' she looked up at the sky, '-it looks like it might rain soon. Certainly don't want to be caught in a down poor with these clothes.'  
“我为什么要看这家店呢？”她心想，“我连杂货都没买，而且——”她抬头望向天空，“——看起来好像快下雨了。当然不想穿着这些衣服被大雨淋湿。”

Asuka refrained from using her school uniform whenever possible, and especially while out in public. She was wearing a tight, red, sleeveless shirt, and a low cut pair of blue jeans that came up to her knees. To top it all off she had brought a pair of red sunglasses that were now resting on her head. It seemed that they would serve no purpose.  
尽可能避免穿校服的明日香，尤其是在公共场合。她穿着一件紧身的红色无袖上衣，以及一条低腰的蓝色牛仔短裤。最后，她还戴了一副红色的太阳镜，现在正架在她的头上。看来它们派不上用场了。

"I should hurry," she mumbled into the crowd of people.  
“我得快点，”她对着人群喃喃自语。

How long it had been since she mumbled that she should hurry? She had no idea. All she knew was that she had entered the grocery store while the rain had not started, and when she left, it was a full down pour  
她咕哝着应该快点，已经过去多久了？她毫无头绪。她只知道，她进杂货店时雨还没开始下，而当她离开时，已经是倾盆大雨。

Standing just outside the grocery store where there was a plastic overhang, she had two large plastic bags of an assortment of things to cook with, and Asuka wondered if she shouldn't just get a cab.  
站在杂货店外的塑料遮檐下，她手里提着两大袋各式各样的烹饪食材，明日香心想，也许她应该叫辆出租车。

Looking into her purse, she saw that she had a little over ten dollars.  
她翻了翻钱包，发现里面还有十美元多一点。

'That should be enough,' she thought suddenly.  
"'这样应该够了，'她突然想到。

Walking calmly out into the down pore, she raised a hand in the air to wave for a taxi cab, when all the sudden, she felt a hand press roughly against her mouth, and another hand grab a hold of the back of her neck. Feeling strong fingers pressing directly against the back of her neck, she tried to force herself to scream, or making some sort of fit, but felt that her body was incapable of moving.  
"她平静地走出雨中，举起手在空中挥舞，想要叫一辆出租车，就在这时，她感到一只手粗鲁地捂住了她的嘴，另一只手抓住了她的后颈。感觉到强有力的手指直接按在她的后颈上，她试图强迫自己尖叫或做出某种挣扎，但感觉自己的身体动弹不得。

Blackness engulfed her as she struggled to stay conscious and the last visible object that she saw, was of a mother running from the rain with a baby cradled in her arms across the street.  
"黑暗吞噬了她，她挣扎着保持清醒，最后看到的景象是一位母亲抱着婴儿，横穿马路，从雨中奔跑。

'I have to scream,' she thought.  
"'我必须尖叫，'她心想。

Just as she was able to force her mouth open, she heard the swish of something heavy falling and heard no more.  
"就在她勉强张开嘴的那一刻，她听到了重物坠落的呼啸声，随后便再无声息。

The entire thing happened without the knowledge of anybody. The only person that could have witnessed this was the mother with her child, but she was too focused on her feet, afraid that she might trip or slide.  
"这一切发生得悄无声息，无人知晓。唯一可能目睹这一幕的是一位带着孩子的母亲，但她正全神贯注于自己的脚步，生怕会绊倒或滑倒。

People walking by, would glance at the forgotten groceries tossed to the side and think what a waste it was to leave perfectly good food in the rain. Eventually, a homeless person would come by later and claim both bags of food.  
路过的人们会瞥一眼被遗忘在路边的杂货，心想把这么好的食物留在雨中真是浪费。最终，一个无家可归的人稍后会过来，拿走这两袋食物。

Asuka's existence had been erased.  
明日香的存在已被抹去。

---

Anxious? Nervous? That summed up what Shinji was feeling right now.  
焦虑？紧张？这正是真嗣此刻的心情。

Okay so it was raining...of course she wouldn't want to get wet so she was probably waiting till it stopped. But it didn't look like there was an end in sight.  
好吧，外面在下雨...她当然不想淋湿，所以可能是在等雨停。但看起来这场雨似乎没有要停的意思。

How many hours had it been? Only one? It sure seemed like more.  
已经过去多少小时了？才一个小时吗？感觉上好像更久。

Asuka had gotten out of school around two forty-five, making the time three forty-five currently.  
明日香大约两点半放学，现在的时间是三点半。

'Calm down,' Shinji told himself as he paced back and forth in the living room. 'Maybe she took a taxi home and the traffic is really bad. It is raining outside. But would she have enough money?' And the question that had been screaming in his face for the past few minutes reared its head. Why the fuck didn't he go with her!  
'冷静点，' 真嗣在客厅里来回踱步时对自己说。'也许她打车回家了，交通真的很糟糕。外面还在下雨。但她有足够的钱吗？' 而那个在过去几分钟里一直在他面前尖叫的问题再次浮现。他妈的为什么他没有和她一起去！

He could understand the school, but why shouldn't they have met downtown. It made no sense. Maybe she wanted to get him a gift and surprise him with it. No, thats totally unlike her. But then, she has been steadily changing. She's become warmer towards him since they first met, and the name calling and abusing has steadily decreased.  
他可以理解学校的规定，但为什么他们不应该在市中心见面。这毫无道理。也许她想给他买个礼物，给他一个惊喜。不，这完全不像她。但话说回来，她一直在逐渐改变。自从他们第一次见面以来，她对他变得温暖多了，那些骂人的话和辱骂也逐渐减少了。

Again, Shinji found himself wanting to rip open the door and charge into the pouring rain, but held himself back, saying that he was overreacting. Everything was fine, nothing had happened...  
真嗣又一次发现自己想要猛地打开门，冲进倾盆大雨中，但他克制住了自己，认为自己在小题大做。一切都很好，什么都没发生...

No, it did. It was unpleasant, but he knew that something had happened. What the fuck was it?  
不，确实发生了。虽然不愉快，但他知道有什么事情发生了。到底他妈的是什么？

If he had been looking in a mirror or any piece of glass he would have seen his eyes flash scarlet for a moment at his sudden anger.  
如果他当时照镜子或任何一块玻璃，他会看到自己的眼睛因突如其来的愤怒而短暂闪现猩红色。

(A/N: **Okay...this next part contains, heavy graphic violence, heavy blood and gore, and attempted rape. If you don't want to read this part, skip to the next bold lettering)**  
（作者注：接下来这部分包含重度暴力、大量血腥和试图强奸的情节。如果你不想阅读这部分，请跳至下一粗体字部分）

Pain suddenly seared through his temples and a rush of visions hit him. Asuka staring at a glass pane where a mannequin was standing behind the glass. Asuka paying for groceries at the counter and then picking up the plastic bags. Asuka standing on the sidewalk with rain droplets peppering her beautiful face as she waved for a taxi. The sudden fear in Asuka's eyes as she felt a man cover her mouth with a gloved hand. The sudden realization that her life was in danger. Shinji watched as Asuka opened her mouth weakly, before the stranger in black brought his hand down with a sickening chop into the back of Asuka's neck, making her entire body go limp.  
剧痛突然刺穿他的太阳穴，一连串的幻象向他袭来。明日香凝视着玻璃窗后站立的人体模特。明日香在收银台付款，然后拿起塑料袋。明日香站在人行道上，雨滴打在她美丽的脸上，她挥手叫出租车。明日香感到一个男人用戴着手套的手捂住她的嘴时，眼中突然流露出的恐惧。她突然意识到自己的生命处于危险之中。真嗣看着明日香虚弱地张开嘴，随后那个黑衣陌生人用手刀狠狠劈在明日香的后颈，使她整个人瘫软下来。

Shinji screamed as another rush of visions hit him, these less distinct and foggy. Asuka telling the man to go fuck himself. The mans response as he slapped her and yelled something back. Her eyes as tears streamed down her face, her arms forcefully pinned against a wall and tied together with a thick cord. The man howling in agony as he looked at the large teeth marks that had been drilled into his forefinger.  
真嗣再次尖叫，又一波幻象冲击着他，这些幻象不那么清晰，模糊不清。明日香告诉那个男人去他妈的。男人回应着扇了她一巴掌并大喊回去。她的眼泪顺着脸颊流下，双臂被强行按在墙上，用一根粗绳绑在一起。男人看着自己食指上被咬出的深深齿痕，痛苦地嚎叫。

Here the images became even more foggy and Shinji felt that someone had put a blindfold over his eyes. Asuka's soulless eyes as the man violated her body. The rapists hands as they slithered around Asuka's developing body, pausing here and there for further examination. A loud cry escaping her lips as a knife dug into the a spot just above her eyebrows. Shinji watched as blood trickled down and into her eyes, mixing with the tears. And then a voice, a horrible voice, the voice of the rapists came clear and into Shinji's head  
这里的影像变得更加模糊，真嗣感觉仿佛有人在他眼前蒙上了一块眼罩。明日香那空洞的眼神，当那个男人侵犯她的身体时。强奸犯的手在她发育中的身体上游走，时而停顿，进行更深入的审视。一声尖叫从她的唇间逃逸，一把刀刺入了她眉心上方的一点。真嗣看着鲜血缓缓流下，混入她的泪水中。接着是一个声音，一个可怕的声音，强奸犯的声音清晰地传入真嗣的脑海

"I'll fuck ya till ya bleedin from more den just one hole ya cunt!"  
“我要干到你从不止一个洞里流血，你这个婊子！”

Everything vaporized and came back as clear as if he was standing right next to Asuka's corpse. A crowd of people stood around the body, and Shinji could see his fellow classmates mixed in with the adults. Her body had been dumped in a gutter, to rot with the weeds and sewage. Her shirt had been torn open with a viscous swipe of a switchblade, slicing into the soft tissue of her breasts. Her face was heavily bruised and it looked as though her jaw had been dislocated sometime during the rape. The large gash above her eyebrow was already starting to attract a healthy swarm of flies. But it was the mixture of semen and blood that drew Shinji's eyes. He had destroyed her, he had not just raped and killed her, he had destroyed her.  
一切化为乌有，又清晰地重现，仿佛他就站在明日香的尸体旁。一群人围着尸体，其中混杂着他的同学和成年人。她的尸体被丢弃在排水沟里，与杂草和污水一同腐烂。她的衬衫被锋利的弹簧刀猛地划开，割入了她柔软的胸部组织。她的脸严重瘀伤，看起来她的下巴在强奸过程中被脱臼了。她眉骨上的大伤口已经开始吸引一群健康的苍蝇。但吸引真嗣目光的是混合在血液中的精液。他毁了她，不仅仅是强奸并杀害了她，他彻底摧毁了她。

Reality returned and Shinji sake onto all fours, gasping for breath. Everything happened in an instant. Shinji couldn't handle it and vomited bile and blood up on the carpet in the living room.  
现实回归，真嗣四肢着地，喘息不已。一切发生在一瞬间。真嗣无法承受，将胆汁和血吐在了客厅的地毯上。

Shivering uncontrollably his first thoughts were, 'Where are we?'  
他 uncontrollably 地颤抖着，第一个念头是：‘我们在哪儿？’

Before he gave his mind a chance to answer he rushed out the door. He would let himself think as he ran.  
在他有机会思考之前，他冲出了门。他会在奔跑中让自己思考。

He had a general idea of where Asuka liked to shop and even thought he recognized the store that she had spent an eternity staring at. 'Where are we,' coursed through his mind followed by, 'how far have we gone?' He had learned, but it had taken sometime. His visions detected what happened, what might happen, and what could happen. The thing is...it isn't accurate. Every human is different; they react differently to different situations. Any one of those things could happen, or they could not. It all depended on reactions and counter reactions. Humans are able to create there own futures, that is what makes them such a unique race. Shinji can not predict over a billion common situations because it is simply beyond a humans grasp.  
他对绫波喜欢购物的地方有个大致的了解，甚至认为他认出了她曾凝视许久的那个店铺。'我们在哪儿'，他的脑海中闪过这个问题，紧接着是'我们走了多远？'他学到了一些，但这需要时间。他的视觉能察觉到发生了什么，可能发生什么，以及可能发生什么。问题是...这并不准确。每个人都是不同的；他们对不同的情况有不同的反应。这些事情中的任何一件都可能发生，也可能不发生。一切都取决于反应和反反应。人类能够创造自己的未来，这就是他们如此独特的种族的原因。真嗣无法预测数十亿种常见情况，因为这超出了人类的理解范围。

He still had a fucking good idea where he was headed though.  
尽管如此，他还是对要去的地方有个相当不错的想法。

---

As Shinji bolted down streets in the pouring rain, Asuka opened her eyes in a dank, musky, boarded up shack roughly one kilometer from where she had been standing what felt like minutes before.  
当真嗣在倾盆大雨中疾驰过街道时，明日香在一间潮湿、霉臭、用木板封住的破旧小屋中睁开了眼睛，这间小屋距离她几分钟前站立的地方大约一公里。

Looking around she didn't immediately see any signs of life until she heard a she heard a raspy chuckle from somewhere straight ahead of her. It was dark though that she had troubles distinguishing it.  
她环顾四周，起初并未发现任何生命迹象，直到她听到前方某处传来一阵沙哑的轻笑。虽然光线昏暗，但她难以辨认出具体位置。

"Awake are ya? Good...cuz I'ma throbbin like a mother fucker."  
“醒了是吧？很好...因为我现在疼得像要命一样。”

Letting out a high pitched laugh, Asuka saw the rapists face come into clearer view. He had light brown hair that was coated in grime and dirt, and when he smiled his teeth were as black as mold.  
发出一声尖锐的笑声，明日香看清了强奸犯的脸。他有着沾满污垢和泥土的浅棕色头发，当他微笑时，牙齿黑得像霉菌一样。

"Say somethin will ya. I like it when they get screamin, turns me on like a-"  
“说点什么吧，我喜欢她们尖叫，那让我兴奋得像——”

Asuka spit a large clump of mucus and spittle onto the bridge of his noes.  
明日香朝他的鼻梁吐了一大口痰和唾沫。

"Fuck off why don't you!"  
"滚开，你这混蛋！"

Grinning in a maniacal way he wiped the sludge of his noes and said, "No thank ya. My cock is sick of mister righty. It wants something to please it. An you look like ya could do that just fine."  
他疯狂地笑着，擦去鼻子上的污泥，说道：“不用了，谢谢。我的老二已经厌倦了右手先生。它想要点能取悦它的东西。而你看起来正合适。”

Asuka spit at him again and said, "Try anything and I swear I'll cut your fucking cock off."  
明日香再次向他吐口水，并说：“敢动一下，我发誓我会把你那该死的鸡巴割下来。”

This statement seemed to enrage him greatly and he struck her hard across the face, bouncing her head off the wooden wall behind her. Asuka went down with a groan and thought she could feel blood trickling from where she had hit her head.  
这句话似乎让他极为愤怒，他重重地打了她一巴掌，使她的头撞在了身后的木墙上。明日香呻吟着倒下，感觉有血从她撞到的地方流出来。

"Bitch! I'll give ya something to have fun with soon."  
“婊子！我很快就会让你尝到苦头。”

Grabbing Asuka by her strawberry hair, he drug her across the musty, dirt floor before throwing her into a corner. As Asuka tried to stand up she felt a claw like hand grasp her throat; he was constricting her wind pipe. His breath was loud and raspy and it smelled like booze. But Asuka had enough experience with drunks to know that this guy was not drunk and that he knew exactly what he was doing. 'Probably done this many times,' she thought savagely.  
他抓住明日香的草莓色头发，将她拖过满是霉味和尘土的地面，然后把她扔进一个角落。明日香试图站起来时，感到一只爪子般的手抓住了她的喉咙；他在压迫她的气管。他的呼吸声大而刺耳，带着一股酒气。但明日香对醉汉有足够的经验，知道这家伙并没有喝醉，他完全清楚自己在做什么。‘可能已经做过很多次了，’她愤怒地想。

She may have been putting up a brave front, but she didn't know how long she'd be able to keep doing that. She was scared, more scared that she had ever been in her life. And that fear ate away at her.  
她或许一直在强撑着勇敢的外表，但她不知道自己还能坚持多久。她害怕，比以往任何时候都要害怕。这种恐惧在侵蚀着她。

"Listen slut," he said suddenly, grabbing a handful of Asuka's hair and jerking her head backwards. "I can kill you and then fuck you or we can have it be the other way around. The flesh is still warm so either way is fine by me."  
“听着，婊子，”他突然说道，抓住明日香的一把头发，猛地将她的头向后拽。“我可以杀了你再干你，或者反过来。反正肉体还是温的，对我来说都无所谓。”

'Is this really a human?' Wondered Asuka. 'This vile creature in front of me that doesn't care as long as he fulfills his desires is really a human?'  
“这真的是人吗？”明日香心想。“这个在我面前只顾满足自己欲望、毫不在乎的卑劣生物，真的是人吗？”

"So whats it gonna be cunt? We fuckin or stabbin?"  
"那你想怎么样，婊子？我们是要干还是捅？"

Asuka released her held breath as she heard a click and saw the blade of a switchblade go flying open.  
听到咔嚓一声，看到弹簧刀的刀刃飞快弹开，明日香松开了憋着的气。

Caressing it gently as though it was a child, the rapist replied, "I've gutted a few many whores with this. Took some prostitutes tities for a keep safe. Didn't want her pussy, that thing was sa-gg-y. How bout I shove this up those pants of your's and find out where it lands?"  
他轻轻抚摸着刀，仿佛在抚慰一个孩子，强奸犯回答道：“我用这把刀捅过不少妓女。还割下过几个妓女的奶子留作纪念。她的那玩意儿太松垮了，我可不感兴趣。不如我把这刀插进你的裤子里，看看会落到哪儿？”

Asuka held her breath, unable to make a sound. Had it really come to this, was she going to be desecrated. She had always thought she would die during an angel attack. Certainly that would have been a lot more dignifying then this.  
明日香屏住呼吸，发不出一点声音。难道真的到了这一步，她将要被玷污吗？她一直以为自己会在与使徒的战斗中死去。那样肯定比现在更有尊严。

"Well, since you don't have much opinion on this I think I'll just see what kind of tits you got. Gotta be doing pretty good with that bulge you got. Younger is always better...I sure hope to God you're a virgin."  
“好吧，既然你对这个没什么意见，那我就看看你的胸部怎么样。有你那鼓起的家伙，肯定不错。年轻总是好的...我真希望你是处女。”

With deadly accuracy, the rapist swiped the switchblade in a downward arc, ripping apart the tight fabric of Asuka's shirt and slicing the bra that she wore under it. Asuka shivered uncontrollably as she felt the cold metal brush against her breasts.  
那强奸犯以致命的准确度挥动弹簧刀，向下划出一道弧线，撕裂了明日香紧身的衬衫和她穿着的胸罩。明日香不由自主地颤抖着，感觉到冰冷的金属触碰到了她的胸部。

"Oh not bad...not to large, not to small, gonna be a good size when you get older of course. Then again I guess you have about five minutes left of your life so better start hoping for large tits. I might give you an extra five minutes if you can grow those."  
"哦，不错...不大不小，等你长大后肯定会很合适。不过话说回来，你大概只剩下五分钟可活了，最好开始祈祷能长出大胸来。如果你能长出来，我或许会多给你五分钟。"

Throwing his head backwards he laughed his high pitched laugh again. Acting on his momentary distraction, Asuka dove to her left, attempting to cover up her exposed breasts in the process. Reacting quicker than she thought he would, he saw the movement quickly and brought his knife downward, grazing her elbow as the blade passed.  
他猛地将头向后仰，再次发出那尖锐的笑声。趁着他分神的瞬间，明日香向左猛扑过去，试图遮住自己暴露的胸部。他的反应比她预想的要快，迅速察觉到她的动作，挥刀向下劈去，刀刃擦过她的肘部。

"Bitch! Get the fuck back here!"  
"婊子！滚回来！"

Swinging the blade wildly, Asuka managed to dodge most of the attacks but without looking where she was going ended up getting cornered against a wall.  
挥舞着刀刃狂乱地躲避，明日香勉强躲过了大部分攻击，但由于没有注意方向，最终被逼到了墙角。

Breathing heavily, the rapist said, "Good run cunt. Get ready to loose some blood though."  
喘着粗气，强奸犯说道：“跑得不错，婊子。准备好流点血吧。”

Striking Asuka hard, he split her lip open against one of her teeth, making a slow trickle of blood flow from her mouth.  
重重地击打明日香，他使她的嘴唇裂开，撞在了一颗牙齿上，鲜血缓缓从她的嘴角流出。

"Looks better that way...maybe you'll learn to be more obedient."  
"这样看起来好多了...也许你会学会更听话。"

Moving at a surprising speed, he slammed his arm into her throat, pressing his entire body weight against his throat as he started to contemplate his work.  
他以惊人的速度移动，猛地将手臂撞向她的喉咙，用全身的重量压在她的喉咙上，同时开始思考他的工作。

"Where should I start? Or would you rather me just skip right to the main-"  
"我该从哪里开始呢？还是你更希望我直接跳到主要的...-"

Asuka bit down hard on the arm that her pinned against the wall. The rapist screamed in fury and pain as her teeth sank deep into his skin  
明日香狠狠地咬住将她按在墙上的那只手臂。强奸犯因剧痛和愤怒尖叫起来，她的牙齿深深陷入他的皮肤。

"YOU BITCH! YOU FUCKING BITCH!"  
“你这个婊子！你这个该死的婊子！”

Wrenching his arm free he looked at her work with shock on his face. Never before had he had so much trouble with a rape victim. He subdued them easily and then banged them without much protest and then dumped there bodies with the other sewage.  
他用力挣脱手臂，脸上露出震惊的表情。他从未遇到过如此难缠的强奸受害者。通常他轻易就能制服她们，然后几乎没有反抗地与她们发生关系，最后将她们的尸体和其他垃圾一起丢弃。

His arm was a large bloody mess as Asuka's teeth marks had torn through many layers of skin before the blood underneath  
他的手臂被撕扯得血肉模糊，阿斯卡的牙印穿透了多层皮肤，鲜血随之涌出。

Glaring at Asuka with nothing but hate now, he had nothing else in his mind now except her death. He would gouge out her eyes balls and feed them to the alligators at the zoo. Burn the hair of her scalp and pull out her teeth. Nobody made a fool out of him.  
他现在满眼都是对阿斯卡的仇恨，心中除了她的死别无他念。他要挖出她的眼珠喂给动物园的鳄鱼，烧掉她的头皮毛发，拔掉她的牙齿。没人能让他成为笑柄。

"Thats it bitch! I'll fuck you till you're bleedin from more then just one hole you cunt!"  
“就这样，婊子！我要操到你不止一个洞流血，你这贱货！”

Swinging the switchblade in a large arc above his head, he brought it down with a sickening whoosh. Asuka felt like she was watching her death in slow motion. 'Ah...I never even got to tell Shinji what I-'  
他挥动着弹簧刀，在头顶划出一道大弧，猛地向下劈来，伴随着令人作呕的呼啸声。明日香感觉自己像是在慢镜头中目睹死亡的降临。'啊...我甚至都没来得及告诉真嗣我-'

Asuka closed her eyes and waited for the odd feeling of her life leaving her body. Her organs and blood moving freely from her body. At least she wouldn't have to worry about being raped anymore if she was dead. She started crying silently...but more than tears had landed on her face. Tears were warm and had a certain distinct feel to them, this liquid was warm, but felt more dense. At first she thought that he had suddenly changed his mind and ejaculated on her. Instead she heard a high pitched wail combined with curse words  
明日香闭上眼睛，等待着生命从身体中流逝的奇异感觉。她的器官和血液自由地从体内流出。至少如果她死了，就不用再担心被强奸了。她开始默默地哭泣...但落在她脸上的不仅仅是泪水。泪水是温暖的，有着独特的触感，而这液体虽然也温暖，却感觉更加浓稠。起初她以为他突然改变了主意，射在了她身上。然而，她却听到了一声尖锐的哀嚎，夹杂着咒骂声。

"WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO MY ARM? WHERE THE FUCK DID IT GO?"  
“这他妈是什么？我的手臂怎么了？它他妈去哪儿了？”

Against her minds protests she opened her eyes slowly.  
尽管内心极力反对，她还是缓缓睁开了眼睛。

The right arm of the rapist had been sliced clean, directly at the elbow. Asuka was able to see the joint of the elbow swing freely without any muscle to hold it in place. Yellow bone marrow coated the inside of the joint and a white puss like substance was leaking out of the stub of an arm.  
强奸犯的右臂从肘部被干净利落地切断。明日香能看到肘关节在没有肌肉支撑的情况下自由摆动。关节内部覆盖着黄色的骨髓，断臂处流出一种类似脓液的白色物质。

The arm had meanwhile flown several feet away from where its original owner stood. The switchblade was still firmly grasped in the hand.  
那只手臂此时已经飞离了原主站立的地方好几英尺。手中的弹簧刀依然紧紧握着。

As Asuka realized what had just happened, she put a hand to her cheek and drew it back to revealing spotted patches of blood. She had been sprayed by the severing of the arm.  
当明日香意识到刚刚发生了什么时，她用手抚摸脸颊，收回时露出了斑斑血迹。她被断臂喷溅出的血液沾染了。

But then...who just- 但那么...刚才是谁——

A large square had been sliced directly into the side of the building, revealing the grayness of the rain outside. Standing just outside that hole was Ikari Shinji. But he was different, his eyes...  
大楼一侧被直接切出了一个巨大的方形缺口，露出了外面灰蒙蒙的雨景。站在那个洞口外的正是碇真嗣。但他变得不同了，他的眼神……

Shinji stepped into the blown out piece of what was considered a house. He looked around calmly, his eyes first settling on Asuka, crouched in the corner with her breasts exposed for everybody to see., and then to the rapist who was curled on the floor, cradling his bloody stump of an arm.  
真嗣踏入了那片被炸毁的废墟，这里曾被视为一所房子。他平静地环顾四周，目光首先落在角落里蹲着的明日香身上，她的胸部暴露无遗；随后转向蜷缩在地上、抱着血淋淋断臂的强奸犯。

Shinji grinned and thought. 'I want to rip his body in half, break his neck, and shred his internal organs.'  
真嗣咧嘴一笑，心中暗想：'我想把他撕成两半，扭断他的脖子，撕碎他的内脏。'

"YOU BASTARD! WHAT DID YOU DO?"  
“你这个混蛋！你做了什么？”

"...What did I do? What did you do?"  
"...我做了什么？你又做了什么？"

Screaming in a mad rage, the rapist charged forward, only to be repelled backwards by an invisible wall.  
强奸犯在疯狂的愤怒中尖叫着冲上前，却被一道无形的墙反弹了回去。

"WHAT WAS-" "这是什么-"

Shinji appeared in front of him with his fist cocked backwards. Orange light flashed momentarily as Shinji thrust his fist forward, except his fist never made contact with the flesh. A small spherical orb suddenly appeared in front of the rapists stomach, before shooting straight through it.  
真嗣突然出现在他面前，拳头向后蓄力。橙光一闪而过，真嗣猛地向前挥拳，然而拳头并未触及肉体。一个微小的球状能量体突然出现在强奸犯的腹部前方，随即直穿而过。

Blood spewed forth from his mouth and it looked like a fountain had just been erected where his stomach once was. A hole, about the size of a fifty cent piece was able to be seen on either of the body. Stomach bile leaked out and fell onto the dirt flooring, spraying it a sickly yellow color. Asuka thought she saw what remained of a half digested sandwich in the mess.  
鲜血从他口中喷涌而出，仿佛在他原本的腹部位置竖起了一座喷泉。身体两侧各有一个约五十元硬币大小的洞。胃液渗出，滴落在泥土地面上，溅成病态的黄色。明日香觉得她看到了那堆混乱中残留的半个未消化的三明治。

Gasping for breath, the rapist took two steps backwards before sinking to his feet, attempting to hold his internal organs inside of him with his other hand. 'What was happening here,' he wondered? Nothing like this had ever happened. He always got away with what he did, ever since he was young. But this person...no, this kid. He was a demon, a monster, and those blood red eyes; those sightless blood red eyes that seemed to be dissecting him as he looked into them. He had to get away. If he didn't he'd surely-  
强奸犯喘着粗气，后退两步后瘫倒在地，试图用另一只手捂住体内的器官。'这里发生了什么？'他疑惑着。这种事从未发生过。自幼以来，他总能逍遥法外。但这个人...不，这个孩子。他是恶魔，是怪物，那双血红的眼睛；那双看似无神却仿佛在剖析他的血红眼睛。他必须逃走。如果他不逃，他肯定会——

Blood spewed forth from his mouth again and dripped down the front of his shirt, making the surface turn shiny with blood. Looking up weakly, he started uttering some feeble words of mercy when Shinji struck again.  
鲜血再次从他口中喷涌而出，沿着衬衫前襟滴落，使其表面泛着血光。他虚弱地抬头，开始低声祈求怜悯，然而真嗣再次出手。

Shinji's fist cascaded directly into the side of his head with two times the force he had used against Asuka's father. The rapists jaw all but disintegrated. The left side of his bottom jaw completely snapped in two, stabbing the bone downward and slicing apart the soft tissue of his throat. A gurgling noise issued in his throat as blood started to seep into his lungs. The top jaw slammed down into his bottom lip, ripping apart every bit of flesh so that if he smiled you would be able to see the roots of his teeth. Blood poured forth from his nose as a large chunk of cartilage dislodged from his nose and wedged itself between his eyes.  
真嗣的拳头如暴雨般直击他的头部侧面，力道是之前对付明日香父亲的两倍。强奸犯的下颚几乎被摧毁。左侧下颚完全断裂成两截，骨刺向下刺穿，割裂了喉咙的软组织。喉咙中发出咕噜声，血液开始渗入肺部。上颚猛地撞击下唇，撕裂了所有肉体，以至于如果他微笑，你将能看到牙齿的根部。鲜血从鼻孔涌出，一大块软骨从鼻中脱落，卡在双眼之间。

The blow had completely knocked him backwards off his feet, and he had gone sailing into the wood wall behind, where he sunk slowly down to the floor, leaving a large smear of blood on the wooden surface. Years later, this shack would be painted a sickly red to cover up all the blood that was spilled today.  
这一击彻底将他击飞，他向后飞去，撞上了身后的木墙，缓缓滑落到地板上，留下一大片血迹在木质表面上。多年以后，这间小屋将被涂成病态的红色，以掩盖今天所洒下的所有鲜血。

Shinji looked down at his fist after the swift punch. Several of his fingers were bent in odd direction, seemingly to be broken. His knuckles were a bloody mess, revealing the white of the bone underneath. Even so, he felt no pain. Only the pain that Asuka had felt.  
真嗣低头看着自己刚刚迅速挥出的拳头。几根手指弯曲得异常，似乎是断了。他的指节血肉模糊，露出了下面的白骨。即便如此，他并未感到疼痛。只有明日香曾感受到的痛楚。

Take several slow steps forward he was somewhat surprised to see that the rapist had somehow managed to regain his feet. 'There must be a large amount of adrenaline pumping through is body right now,' Shinji thought.  
他缓缓向前走了几步，有些惊讶地发现那个强奸犯不知怎么又站了起来。'此刻他体内一定涌动着大量肾上腺素，'真嗣心想。

As the rapist took a slow step forward, Shinji made a quick movement with his right hand and the rapists fell flat on his face as his left foot was taken off directly below the ankle. He was in the middle of walking forward again when his foot had been sliced off. The two bones ground together with the sound of nails on a chalk board. His upper leg slid off to the side, leaving his foot upright where it had still been connected. Yellow marrow bubbled to the surface of the leg and started flowing onto the ground. It almost looked like he had pissed himself, in which Shinji reminded himself that he had, moments before.  
当强奸犯缓慢地向前迈步时，真嗣迅速用右手一挥，对方便脸朝下重重摔倒，因为他的左脚踝直接被切断。他正要再次向前走时，脚被切断了，两根骨头摩擦发出令人毛骨悚然的声音。他的大腿上半部分滑向一边，留下那只脚依然直立在原本连接的地方。黄色的骨髓涌出，开始流到地面上。看起来几乎像是他尿了裤子，真嗣提醒自己，就在不久前，他的确尿了。

With what remained of his face was planted firmly in the dirt his teeth were not only coated with grime but also dirt now. Shinji looked down at the bloody mess of what was once a human minutes ago. Smiling slightly, he knew he didn't have much time before he certainly die from blood loss.  
他的脸深深埋在泥土中，牙齿不仅沾满了污垢，还混杂着泥土。真嗣低头看着几分钟前还是人类的血肉模糊的残骸，微微一笑，他知道自己失血过多，命不久矣。

Walking over to him, he was immensely glad that he was still conscious. Shinji wanted to see the fear in his eyes as he slowly crushed him to death.  
他走过去，非常庆幸对方还清醒着。真嗣想要看到他眼中的恐惧，慢慢地将他碾压至死。

In what was very well his last feeble attempt at retaliation, the rapist's other hand twitched slightly and Shinji all but glanced at it before the hand was taken off at the wrist. Bone stuck out of this new stub of an arm and Shinji grinned at his work. Oh this felt good!  
这很可能是他最后一次无力的反抗，强奸犯的另一只手微微抽搐，真嗣几乎没看一眼，那只手就被从手腕处切断。骨头从新断臂的残端突出，真嗣对自己的杰作咧嘴一笑。哦，这种感觉真好！

Looking down at the rapist, no emotion was in his eyes. Nothing could save this human, and he could understand why the angels wished to destroy the earth. It was polluted by humans, and here was an example of such pollution.  
俯视着那个强奸犯，他的眼中没有一丝情感。这个人类已无可救药，他也能理解为何天使们希望毁灭地球。它被人类污染了，而眼前就是这种污染的例证。

Shinji stepped on the rapists chest and pressed down with such force that he heard several ribs snap. Very likely the splinters had been lodged in some major organ...if he was lucky.  
真嗣踩在强奸犯的胸口上，施加的力量之大，以至于他听到了几根肋骨断裂的声音。很可能骨片已经刺入了某个重要器官...如果他幸运的话。

As he continued applying more pressure he felt himself sinking further into the ground as the rapists body was slowly being ground into a bloody husk of flesh. It was time to finish it.  
随着他继续施加压力，他感觉自己正逐渐陷入地面，强奸犯的身体慢慢被碾成了一滩血肉模糊的残骸。是时候结束了。

Shinji slammed an AT-field on top of the rapist covering every portion of his remaining body except for the head. From the shoulders down he was being covered by an AT-field, all that was free was the head. Breathing had become difficult as his lungs had almost been filled to the top with blood, but the air that he was able to receive and send to his brain was now being prevented by the AT-field. His neck was heavily being compressed and no amount of oxygen could pass through his Trachea.  
真嗣在强奸犯的身上施加了一个 AT 力场，覆盖了他身体的每一部分，除了头部。从肩膀以下都被 AT 力场覆盖，只有头部是自由的。呼吸变得困难，因为他的肺几乎被血液填满，但现在 AT 力场阻止了他接收和向大脑输送的空气。他的脖子被严重压缩，没有任何氧气能通过他的气管。

His body was being forced into the hard ground, but his body was no longer sinking into the ground. Blood pressure started to build up as it all started to travel to the brain. His heart ceased to function properly. Blood poured from his ears and nostrils and his veins soon became backed up with blood.  
他的身体被强行压入坚硬的地面，但他的身体不再下沉。血压开始上升，所有的血液都开始流向大脑。他的心脏停止了正常工作。血液从他的耳朵和鼻孔中涌出，血管很快就被血液堵塞。

With a popping sound like that of a toilet being unplugged, his right eye popped out of its socket and hung limply next to the broken nose, freed from the brain. Blood trickled forth from the bloody socket and dribbled down into his open mouth.  
随着一声像马桶被拔掉塞子的爆裂声，他的右眼从眼窝中弹出，无力地挂在断裂的鼻梁旁，脱离了大脑。血液从血淋淋的眼窝中流出，滴入他张开的嘴里。

Bulges started to form in his neck as the blood pressure was building. It was like a champagne bottle. You shook it, and all the pressure from the carbonate sent the cork flying.  
他的脖子上开始鼓起肿块，血压正在升高。就像一瓶香槟。你摇晃它，所有碳酸的压力让瓶塞飞了出去。

It happened in less than an instance.  
这一切发生在一瞬间。

Just like the champagne bottle, the blood pressure in the neck built up to a point where the veins could no longer contain it. It exploded.  
就像那瓶香槟一样，脖子里的血压升至极限，血管再也承受不住。它爆发了。

Flesh was rendered, cerebral fluid was spewed across the floor, bits of bones and flesh were sent flying in all directions as the rapists head dislodged from the rest of his body. The remaining eye exploded, showering Shinji's face with clear liquid. Brain matter was clumped in a spot against the wall with bits of the spinal cord still attached. What remained of his jaw was sent skidding across the slick floor with pieces of teeth still attached.  
血肉横飞，脑浆四溅，碎骨与肉块四处飞散，施暴者的头颅与身体分离。剩下的那只眼球爆裂，清澈的液体溅了真嗣一脸。脑组织粘在墙上一处，还连着些许脊髓。残留的下颚在光滑的地板上滑行，带着几颗牙齿碎片。

(A/N: **So here is where it ends. Basically Shinji had a vision of the possibility that Asuka could get raped and reacted on that. The rapist was pretty much dismembered with Shinji using an AT-field.**  
（作者注：故事至此结束。基本上，真嗣预见到了明日香可能被强暴的可能性并因此做出了反应。施暴者被真嗣用 AT 力场肢解得支离破碎。）

He was dead. What should never have happened was over.  
他死了。本不该发生的一切都结束了。

Shinji looked down at the remains of something that should never have been born. More than blood had been built up and Shinji could see that his organs had been compressed significantly. Most likely he had died long before his head was actually dislodged from the rest of his body, but Shinji felt better thinking about it this way.  
真嗣低头看着那些本不该诞生的残骸。不仅仅是血液，他能看到内脏被严重挤压。很可能在那人的头颅真正从身体上分离之前，他就已经死去多时了，但真嗣觉得这样想会让自己感觉好一些。

He suddenly felt tired and ached all over, especially his hand. It was hard to comprehend what he had just done, but he had been fully aware when he dismembered the man. He knew what he had wanted to do, and so he had done it. Even so though, why was he exhibiting angel powers, for he knew certainly that he had used an AT-field? But then, did that mean that his visions was also a unique trait of an angels?  
他突然感到疲惫不堪，全身疼痛，尤其是手。他难以理解自己刚刚做了什么，但在肢解那个人时，他是完全清醒的。他知道自己想要做什么，于是就做了。即便如此，为什么他会展现出天使的力量，因为他确信自己使用了 AT 力场？但这是否意味着他的幻觉也是天使的独特特征之一？

However, those things would come later. First he should attend to  
然而，那些事情留待以后再考虑。首先，他应该处理

"Asuka..." "明日香……"

Hurrying over to her side he saw that her eyes were glazed over, as though she was not in tune with reality. Shinji couldn't blame her. She had been moments away from being raped and murder, only to then watch her roommate rip apart another human with angel powers. She must be going through something he could even grasp right now.  
他急忙赶到她身边，发现她的眼神呆滞，仿佛与现实脱节。真嗣无法责怪她。她刚刚差点被强奸和谋杀，紧接着又目睹室友用天使之力将另一个人撕成碎片。她现在经历的事情，他甚至无法完全理解。

Slowly though, she seemed to come back to reality as the grayness in her eyes reverted to the normal blue. Slowly she looked up, looking over at the bloody mess in front of her, before turning to see Shinji kneeling next to her. His eyes had returned to their usual brown color.  
不过渐渐地，她的眼神似乎恢复了正常，灰色变回了平常的蓝色。她缓缓抬起头，目光掠过眼前的血腥场面，然后转向跪在她身边的真嗣。他的眼睛也恢复了平常的棕色。

"...shinji..." “...真嗣...”

"I'm here Asuka." "我在这里，明日香。"

Brushing the tangled mess of hair out of her eyes, he felt stickiness in her hair. Moving his hand to the back of her head he felt moisture and realized that she had a head injury. Anger surged through him and he felt a sudden urge to grind what remained into the rapist into nothing but dust. No, he needs to control himself until he understands more about his power, because he understood now that his emotions are whats triggering his powers. Until he can control them at will he needs to be careful.  
他拨开她眼前纠结的乱发，感觉到发丝间的黏腻。将手移到她后脑，他触到了湿润，意识到她头部受了伤。愤怒涌上心头，他突然有种冲动，想把那个强奸犯碾成尘埃。不，他需要控制自己，直到他更了解自己的力量，因为他现在明白，是他的情绪触发了这些力量。在他能随心所欲地控制它们之前，他必须小心行事。

"...Shinji," Asuka whispered again.  
"...真嗣，"明日香再次低声唤道。"

Wordlessly Shinji reached over to the shoulder farthest from him and brought her to his chest. Enveloping her in a tight hug he didn't even given note to the fact that her bare breasts were pressed against the sweatshirt that he was wearing.  
无言地，真嗣伸出手，触碰到离他最远的那边肩膀，将她揽入怀中。他紧紧地拥抱着她，甚至没有注意到她的赤裸胸部紧贴在他穿着的连帽衫上。

"I'm here Asuka," he said again.  
“我在这里，明日香。”他又说了一遍。

All at once her pent up emotions exploded onto his chest. A waterfall of tears cascaded down onto Shinji's chest as Asuka cried out her worries.  
突然间，她积压已久的情绪在他的胸前爆发。泪水如瀑布般倾泻而下，明日香哭喊着宣泄她的忧虑。

Shinji was silent as Asuka cried on him. What could he honestly do? He couldn't take it away. It was something that would always be hovering over her. It is quite possibly the most psychological traumatizing thing that can happen to a woman. The only thing that he could be glad for was that he had prevented the rape from escalating. If he had been too late, like in the possible outcome of the vision, he probably would have committed mass homicide from frustration.  
真嗣沉默地任由明日香在他怀里哭泣。他又能做些什么呢？他无法消除这一切。这阴影将永远笼罩着她。这或许是女性所能遭遇的最严重的心理创伤。他唯一感到庆幸的是，他阻止了强奸的进一步升级。如果他来得太晚，就像那个可能的预见中那样，他可能会因沮丧而犯下大规模谋杀。

He held deep affection for Asuka. He would throw himself off a bridge if it enabled him to protect her. Where did this affection come from? He didn't know really. He had been around her so much that he had grown to just enjoy being near her. To be able to hear her voice as she spoke. The feel of her silky hair if it accidentally brushed against him. The way she walked...floated more like. The feel of her smooth skin if chance happened and he was able to be close enough to her.  
他对明日香怀有深厚的感情。如果跳下桥能保护她，他会毫不犹豫。这种感情从何而来？他并不真正清楚。他一直陪伴在她身边，渐渐地，仅仅是待在她附近就让他感到愉悦。能听到她说话的声音，偶尔她的秀发拂过他的感觉，她走路的样子……更像是飘动。如果有机会近距离接触，她光滑肌肤的触感。

Was it love? 这是爱吗？

Deeper. 更深。

Yes it was deeper. But what went deeper than love? Asuka was truly the first person that he was able to connect with, because they had both been hurt by people. They shared similarities certainly, but Shinji felt that Asuka was the only person that would never leave him. Correction: she wouldn't leave him because she would be hurt just as much as Shinji would be. Shinji filled the space in Asuka's heart that she had hallowed herself. She needed him, just as much as he needed her.  
是的，它更深。但还有什么比爱更深呢？明日香是他真正能够与之相连的第一人，因为他们都曾被他人伤害过。他们的确有相似之处，但真嗣觉得明日香是唯一一个永远不会离开他的人。更正：她不会离开他，因为她会受到和真嗣一样多的伤害。真嗣填补了明日香心中她自己挖空的那部分。她需要他，正如他需要她一样。

Burying his face in her hair, he ran his hands through the hair that flowed behind her back, trying to untangle it as much as possible. It didn't help much, but he felt that it soothed her nonetheless.  
他将脸埋进她的发丝中，双手穿过她背后流淌的长发，尽可能地试图解开那些纠缠的发丝。虽然效果不大，但他觉得这仍然能安抚她。

"Hey...Shinji," said Asuka with a muffled voice as she was still pressed against his chest.  
"嘿...真嗣," 明日香用闷闷的声音说道，她仍然紧贴在他的胸前。

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

"...You're suffocating me."  
"...你快把我闷死了。"

"...Huh?" "...啊？"

Drawing back, Shinji let go of Asuka and indeed saw that her face was slightly blue. He apparently needed to reevaluate his strength.  
真嗣松开手，往后退了一步，确实看到明日香的脸色有些发青。看来他需要重新评估自己的力气了。

"Sorry." "对不起。"

"No...its okay," said Asuka as she leaned into his chest again, though this time Shinji let his arms stay by his side.  
"不...没事的," 明日香再次靠在他的胸前说道，尽管这次真嗣让他的手臂依旧垂在身旁。

Silence passed between them, and the Asuka said something that Shinji had been fearing.  
他们之间陷入了沉默，随后明日香说出了真嗣一直担心的话。

"What did you do to him?"  
"你对他做了什么？"

Shinji hesitated. He thought that Asuka might already know, but wanted to be sure. But was he ready to tell her that he might somehow be connected to the angels? He didn't think so. What if she became fearful of him. He could handle everybody else shunning him as long as Asuka stayed by his side. So instead he said-  
真嗣犹豫了。他觉得明日香可能已经知道了，但想确认一下。但他准备好告诉她，他可能与使徒有某种联系吗？他不这么认为。如果她因此害怕他怎么办。只要明日香在他身边，他可以忍受其他人的疏远。所以他改口说——

"I'd rather not talk about it right now."  
“我现在不想谈这个。”

Asuka knew he was going to say this, but still tried anyway. When Shinji wanted to talk she would be there for him, as he had always been there for her. Instead she pulled to subject away from what he had done and instead said, "I wouldn't mind staying like this forever."  
明日香知道他会这么说，但还是尝试了。当真嗣想倾诉时，她会在他身边，就像他一直陪伴着她一样。相反，她把话题从他所做的事情上引开，转而说道：“我不在乎永远这样下去。”

Understanding that she was shifting the conversation in respect for his wishes, Shinji said, "You know we can't do that."  
意识到她是为了尊重他的意愿而转移话题，真嗣说道：“你知道我们不能那样做。”

"...No I suppose not," here she glanced over at the mauled corpse of the rapists and Shinji felt her shudder.  
“……不，我想也是，”她瞥了一眼那被撕裂的强奸犯尸体，真嗣感觉到她在颤抖。

"I don't want to think about it," said Asuka as she turned back to Shinji's chest, gripping his sweatshirt.  
“我不想去想这些，”明日香说着转回真嗣的胸膛，紧抓着他的运动衫。

"...Don't then. Don't ever think about it. Just remember that I'm here for you."  
"...那就别想了。永远不要去想。只要记住，我在这里陪着你。"

"Hmm. Okay." "嗯，好吧。"

They stayed like that for what felt like an eternity, just meshing with each other, letting the heat from each others bodies keep them warm while the storm raced outside. Asuka shivered though and the moment was broken  
他们就这样待着，仿佛度过了一个永恒，彼此融合，让对方身体的热量温暖自己，而外面的风暴肆虐。但明日香颤抖了一下，这一刻被打破了。

"You cold?" Asked Shinji.  
"你冷吗？" 真嗣问道。

"A little..." "一点点..."

Shinji first took notice that Asuka's shirt lay into two tattered rags and was split down the middle revealing her bare breasts. He tried not to notice that they were unusually perky. Glancing up quickly he saw that she had been watching him intently, as though waiting for a reaction.  
真嗣首先注意到的是，明日香的衬衫变成了两块破布，中间裂开，露出了她的胸部。他尽量不去注意它们异常挺拔。他迅速抬头一看，发现她正专注地盯着他，仿佛在等待他的反应。

"...Wear my sweatshirt then, if you're cold."  
"...那就穿我的运动衫吧，如果你冷的话。"

Asuka continued looking at him intently before saying, "...Thanks. But I'm fine like this."  
明日香继续专注地看着他，然后说道：“……谢谢。但我这样就挺好。”

Shinji blinked several times before uttering a confused, "Huh?"  
真嗣眨了几次眼，困惑地发出一声：“哈？”

Asuka clarified herself. "Whether its on me or not doesn't make that much of a difference. If you wear it then that means I'll just stick close to you. We can share the warmth."  
明日香进一步解释道：“不管是在我身上还是你身上，差别不大。如果你穿了，那我就靠近你一点。我们可以共享这份温暖。”

"But...your...err." "但...你的...呃."

"Yes." "是的。"

Shinji mumbled something very quietly.  
真嗣小声地咕哝了些什么。

"What? Didn't catch that?"  
"什么？没听清？"

"I said that your breasts are exposed," he managed to blurt out.  
"我说你的胸部露出来了。" 他好不容易才脱口而出。

Asuka was silent for a moment and Shinji was sure that she would start hitting him for seeing her breasts, though instead she said, "So you saw them?"  
绫波沉默了一会儿，真嗣确信她会因为看到她的胸部而开始打他，但她却说："那么你看到了？"

"...I wasn't looking or anything...but yeah...I did."  
"...我不是故意看的...但确实...我看到了。"

Asuka sighed and said, "Forget it then and just give me your sweatshirt."  
明日香叹了口气，说道：“算了，那就把你的运动衫给我吧。”

'Wouldn't it have been easier to just take it in the first place instead of teasing me,' thought Shinji.  
“一开始直接拿走不就好了，何必逗我呢，”真嗣心想。

Pulling the sweatshirt over his head he tossed it to a wordless Asuka, while keeping his eyes fix straight ahead.  
他脱下运动衫，径直扔给了沉默的明日香，同时目光始终直视前方。

"Thanks...but you're gonna be cold now."  
"谢谢...但你现在会冷的。"

"I'll be-" "我会——"

"Didn't I say that it didn't matter who wore the sweatshirt, as long as they shared the warmth," said Asuka as she snuggled up next to Shinji.  
""我不是说过吗，谁穿运动衫不重要，只要能分享温暖就行。"" 明日香说着，紧挨着真嗣靠了过去。

"Well...yes, but-" "嗯...是的，但是-"

"Then there shouldn't be any complaints," replied Asuka as she tilted her head onto Shinji's shoulder.  
"那就不该有任何怨言了。" 明日香说着，将头靠在真嗣的肩上。

"I suppose..." "我想也是..."

"Then everything is fine," replied Asuka as she closed her eyes.  
"那么一切都好，" 明日香闭上眼睛回答道。

Shinji sighed and let himself submit to Asuka's will, and really, he enjoyed it.  
真嗣叹了口气，任由自己顺从明日香的意愿，实际上，他也很享受。

"Hey Shinji?" “嘿，真嗣？”

"...What?" "...什么？"

"I just realized I never said my thanks...I'm mean...for rescuing me..."  
"我刚刚意识到我从未表达过我的感谢...我的意思是...为了救我..."

"...No, you don't have to, I already know that you appreciate...no, appreciate isn't a word to describe your gratitude."  
"...不，你不必，我已经知道你感激...不，感激这个词远不足以形容你的谢意。"

"Even...so..." "即便...如此..."

'...What was this? Was this honestly happening?' Shinji's brain couldn't even contemplate something like this. What was this softness that was pressed against his cheek? Did Asuka seriously just kiss him on the cheek?  
'...这是怎么回事？这真的发生了吗？' 真嗣的大脑甚至无法理解这样的事情。贴在他脸颊上的这种柔软是什么？难道明日香真的亲了他的脸颊？

It happened in less than a second. It was like...Asuka blindly turned to Shinji and kissed him before turning away. But that instance still felt like a life time to Shinji. What was the significance in it though? Friendship? Love?  
这一切发生不到一秒钟。就像...明日香盲目地转向真嗣，吻了他，然后又转过身去。但对真嗣来说，那一刻仿佛一生一世。然而，这其中的意义何在？是友谊？还是爱情？

Glancing at Asuka with his mouth firmly closed, he saw that she was biting her blood stained lips and Shinji wondered if he didn't have a bloody kiss mark on his cheek.  
他紧闭着嘴瞥向明日香，看到她正咬着沾血的嘴唇，真嗣不禁疑惑自己脸上是否留下了血吻的痕迹。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"What?" She snapped while blushing furiously.  
“什么？”她气急败坏地红了脸。

"...Err thanks..." "...呃，谢谢..."

"...Whatever," said Asuka as she sank back onto Shinji's shoulders.  
"...随便吧，" 明日香说着又靠回到真嗣的肩膀上。

Shinji could help but feel a grin spread across his face. It was a start at least.  
真嗣忍不住脸上露出了笑容。至少这是个开始。

However...things were about to change  
然而...一切即将改变

Was that a helicopter he heard? No...that was definitely a helicopter.  
他听到的是直升机吗？不...那确实是一架直升机。

He could see the silhouette as it came in for a landing just outside of the square that he had opened up. He was amazed that a helicopter could even land in just a narrow space. But then, why was their a helicopter here in the first place?  
他能看到那轮廓正朝着广场外降落。他惊讶于直升机竟能在如此狭窄的空间着陆。但话说回来，这里为何会有一架直升机呢？

As it landed, Shinji recognized two of the figures that jumped off the helicopter. Looking around at Asuka he saw that she was also watching as Misato and Ritsuko started running towards them.  
当直升机降落时，真嗣认出了从上面跳下来的两个人影。他环顾四周，看到明日香也在注视着，美里和律子正朝他们跑来。

"Get a containment team down here immediately and move that corpse while your at it," said Ritsuko. "I don't want anybody to know about this except for the people here.  
“立刻叫一支封锁小组下来，顺便把那具尸体移走，”律子说道，“除了这里的人，我不想让任何人知道这件事。”

It was something in her face which made Shinji skeptical, almost fearful. What was going on?  
是她的表情让真嗣感到怀疑，甚至有些害怕。到底发生了什么？

As Misato walked towards them, something went fleetingly through Shinji's mind. 'They know what I did and what I used. There gonna restrain me."  
当美里走向他们时，真嗣的脑海中掠过一丝念头。'他们知道我做了什么，用了什么。他们会限制我。'

Standing up abruptly, Shinji was briefly able to see Misato hesitate before she continued walking forward. She was not smiling.  
真嗣突然站起身，短暂地看到美里在继续前行前犹豫了一下。她没有微笑。

"Shinji...I'm sorry but we need you to come to Nerv."  
“真嗣……对不起，但我们需要你来 NERV。”

"Why?" "为什么？"

"...I'd rather not have to answer that."  
"...我还是不想回答那个问题。"

"But you know!" "但你知道的！"

"Yes I do...and I tried to stop it, but I have no control over the science department. I'm sorry but we'll have to take you in."  
"是的，我知道...我试图阻止，但我无法控制科学部门。很抱歉，我们得带你走了。"

"And what! Run experiments on me!"  
"“什么！在我身上做实验！”"

Misato's eyes shifted and Shinji could tell that he had hit the nail on the head.  
美里眼神一变，真嗣看得出他正中要害。

At this point Asuka spoke up, "What are you talking about Misato! If Shinji hadn't...done what he did, I would be dead right now. Can you imagine what it was like for me! And now you're taking him away? Why damn it!"  
这时明日香开口了，“美里，你们在说什么呢！如果不是真嗣做了那件事，我现在已经死了。你能想象我当时的感觉吗！而现在你却要把他带走？为什么，该死的！”

"Asuka please, I don't want to argue right now..."  
"明日香，求你了，我现在不想吵架..."

"I don't give a fuck what you want to do! Shinji saved me. Who cares what he _did_ save me!"  
"我才不在乎你想干什么！真嗣救了我。谁在乎他做了什么才救了我！"

"Asuka..." "明日香……"

"No I wont-" "不，我不会-"

Shinji stuck out his hand to stop her.  
真嗣伸出一只手拦住了她。

"It'll be fine..." "没事的……"

"Shin-" "真-

He cut her off by fiercely hugging her, pulling her close to him.  
他猛地抱住她，紧紧地将她拉向自己，打断了她的话。

"Its fine..." "没事的..."

"But-" "但——"

"It won't take long...I promise."  
"不会太久的...我保证。"

"You do?" "真的吗？"

"Course I do. When have I been wrong?"  
“当然，我什么时候错过？”

Asuka raised an eyebrow but said nothing. "Fine...do what you must."  
明日香挑了挑眉，但没说什么。“好吧……你随意。”

Shinji nodded and released his hold on her. Gazing back into her eyes for a moment, he gently brushed the back of his hand against her cheek.  
真嗣点点头，松开了她。他凝视着她的眼睛片刻，温柔地用手指背轻抚她的脸颊。

"Come visit me if you get the change."  
"有机会的话，来看我吧。"

"Yeah...I will." "嗯...我会的。"

Turning to Misato he said, "Okay, I'm ready."  
他转向美里说："好了，我准备好了。"

Misato nodded and turned towards the helicopter with Shinji walking beside her. Shinji couldn't help but notice that she seemed to be putting an unusual amount of distance between herself and Shinji.  
美里点点头，转身向直升机走去，真嗣跟在她身旁。真嗣不禁注意到，她似乎在刻意与自己保持一段不寻常的距离。

'So everyone is suddenly afraid of me are they?' Shinji thought. 'Well, they can't be as scared as I am to find out about myself.'  
'所以大家都突然害怕我了吗？' 真嗣心想。'好吧，他们不可能比我更害怕发现自己。'

Shinji slowly walked towards the helicopter, wondering how long he'd be apart from Asuka.  
真嗣缓缓走向直升机，心中疑惑着自己将与明日香分离多久。

### Chapter 13: Tests

**Hey all, sorry that it took me so long to update this. Honestly speaking, I felt like taking a break after that double post on Halloween, those four days were hectic. Anyways I'm back and working again. Also, I'm gonna do a nice After Impact one shot of Shinji and Asuka (Christmas related of course) so look forward to that. I'm probably putting it out on Christmas Eve, and hopefully another chapter of this on the same day.  
大家好，很抱歉这么久才更新。老实说，万圣节那次双更之后，我感觉需要休息一下，那四天真是忙得不可开交。不管怎样，我回来了，继续工作。另外，我会写一篇关于真嗣和明日香的《后影响》短篇（当然是圣诞主题的），敬请期待。我可能会在圣诞夜发布，希望当天还能更新这一章。**

When was the last time that Shinji had had a dream such as this? For the longest time his dreams had been filled with nothing but bleak futures, bloodshed, and the end of the human race. This dream though, was certainly different. More different in fact then the reality that Shinji was currently living in, and would give almost anything to be living in the dream.  
真嗣上一次做这样的梦是什么时候？很长一段时间以来，他的梦里充斥着黯淡的未来、血腥和人类的终结。然而，这个梦确实不同。实际上，它比真嗣目前所处的现实更加不同，他几乎愿意付出一切来生活在梦中。

Everything was different. No angels, and most of all...no Evangelion. A world where his mother still existed and a father who cared about him. Was it still Tokyo-3? His dream didn't go to that level of precision. He imagined that it was, or at least he hoped that it could have been. He had some how become attached to the city and was rather reluctant to leave it, even in his dream.  
一切都变了。没有天使，最重要的是……没有 EVA。一个母亲依然存在，父亲也关心他的世界。这里还是第三新东京市吗？他的梦并没有细致到那个程度。他想象着是的，或者至少他希望可能是。他不知怎么地对这座城市产生了依恋，即使在梦中也不太愿意离开。

There were other noticeable changes, and rather large at that. He was older, eighteen or nineteen from the look of things, and he had a hair on his face. A little minuscule, but still hard to miss. This was himself after all and he was supposed to know himself well. Though of course now, he wasn't so sure.  
还有其他明显的变化，而且相当大。他看起来更年长，十八九岁的样子，脸上还长出了胡须。虽然很微小，但依然难以忽视。毕竟这是他自己，他应该很了解自己。不过现在，他不太确定了。

Everyone still existed. His friends were of course older, Misato didn't seem to drink at all, (which he thought was somehow inexplicably wrong) Rei was talkative to the point of being annoying, and Asuka...  
所有人依然存在。他的朋友们当然也都长大了，美里似乎滴酒不沾，（这让他觉得有些莫名其妙地不对劲）丽变得健谈到令人烦扰，而明日香……

While he was...embarrassed to admit it, the first thing he noticed was that she was fuller in the chest. He felt sort of disgusted that this was the first thing that he noticed about the aged version of her. Out of all the redeeming features about her, he had to notice that most.  
虽然他...尴尬地承认，他首先注意到的是她的胸部更丰满。他感到有些厌恶，这是他注意到她年长版本的第一件事。在她所有的可取之处中，他偏偏注意到了这一点。

Her hair was relatively the same, at least in color. Now though, it seemed to reach past her waist, and she had abandoned the hair clips that she always wore. Maybe since the Eva's didn't exist she saw no reason to use them. He had never really asked her why she insisted on keeping the receptors on her head, even when they weren't in combat.  
她的头发大体上颜色相同，至少在颜色上。但现在，它似乎垂到了腰部以下，她放弃了总是戴着的那些发夹。也许是因为 Eva 不存在，她觉得没有理由使用它们。他从未真正问过她为什么坚持保留头上的接收器，即使在非战斗时也是如此。

Her facial features were much the same, a little older he supposed, and her cheekbones were possibly more pronounced then before. She seemed more happy though, less reluctant to smile than he had known, and he saw that she had a glimmering smile that made him feel like he was looking at the sun. It was quite painful.  
她的面部特征大体相同，他猜想可能稍微老了一些，颧骨可能比以前更明显。不过她似乎更快乐了，比他所知的更少勉强微笑，他看到她闪烁的笑容让他感觉像是在直视太阳。这相当刺眼。

He saw this all from a different perspective of course, as you normally would in a dream. His older self seemed to be on similar terms with Asuka as he knew that he himself was. Though with less berating and yelling involved from the look of things. In fact, if he didn't know any better, he would guess that they were leaning towards a less friendly relationship and a more romantic one. That was a thought that made him frown slightly. Not in disgust or anything, but just in bemusement. He could only imagine the reaction he'd get from the Asuka he knew if he asked her out on a date.  
当然，他从不同的角度看到了这一切，就像在梦中通常会做的那样。他的年长自我似乎与明日香处于相似的关系，正如他所知道的那样。不过，看起来少了许多责骂和吼叫。事实上，如果他不知道得更多，他会猜测他们正倾向于一种不那么友好的关系，而是一种更浪漫的关系。这个想法让他微微皱眉。不是因为厌恶或其他，只是感到困惑。他只能想象如果他向他所认识的明日香提出约会，她会有什么反应。

'_Like what you see_?' Said a voice to his left.  
'喜欢你所看到的吗？'一个声音从他的左边传来。

Shinji should have known that this was too good to be true, and sure enough the pseudo Asuka was leaning against a wall as she watched his reaction to...the future? A possible future? Or just an imaginative future which Shinji had created on a whim?  
真嗣本该知道这好得令人难以置信，果然，伪明日香正靠在墙上，观察着他对...未来的反应？一个可能的未来？还是真嗣一时兴起创造的一个想象中的未来？

Sighing, resigning to the usual, Shinji said, 'I was wondering when you would show up.'  
叹了口气，无奈地接受这常态，真嗣说道：'我就在想你什么时候会出现。'

'_Oh? Grown accustomed to me have you_?'  
'哦？已经习惯我了吗？'

'In an odd way...yeah, I have.'  
'说来也怪...是的，习惯了。'

'_I'll take that as a compliment. Anyway, like what you see_?'  
'我就当你是在夸我了。话说回来，喜欢你所看到的吗？'

'I'm not really sure what I'm seeing. This is a dream, correct?'  
'我不太确定我看到了什么。这是梦，对吧？'

'_Either that or the people outside have some how entered your mind and have sent you into an imaginative world_.'  
'要么是梦，要么是外面的人不知怎么进入了你的心智，把你送进了一个充满想象的世界。'

'By the people outside...what do you mean?'  
“外面的人……你是什么意思？”

Waving his question off, she replied, '_Never mind. Forget I said anything_.'  
她挥手打断他的疑问，回答道：“算了，别在意。就当我什么都没说。”

'...Fine, be all silent. But answer me this...is this at all possible.'  
“……好吧，保持沉默。但回答我这个问题……这真的有可能吗？”

It took the pseudo Asuka a minute before she finally answered. _'Maybe...though unlikely. This is certainly a possible outcome of the future. But your decisions up till now have moved away from this possible outcome.'_  
伪明日香沉默了一会儿，才终于回答道：'或许吧...虽然可能性不大。这确实是未来可能出现的结果之一。但你至今所做的决定已经偏离了这个可能的未来。'

'...My decisions up till? Sorry! I wasn't aware that I had made wrong choices!'  
'...我的决定至今？抱歉！我并不知道自己做出了错误的选择！'

'_Oh but you have. You've made wrong choices since day one. You had other options, but you just never gave thought to them. Now you have to deal with the future that is currently in store for you.'_  
'哦，但你确实如此。从一开始你就做出了错误的选择。你本有其他选择，但你从未考虑过它们。现在，你只能面对当前为你准备的未来。'

'And that is?' '那是什么？'

Grinning slightly, she said, _'Bleak, and I'll leave it at that.'_  
她微微一笑，说道：'阴郁，我就说到这儿吧。'

'Why is it always like that? Once, just once, I would have enjoyed a normal teenagers life.'  
'为什么总是这样？哪怕一次，我也希望能过上普通青少年的生活。'

'_You can complain all you want, but you never had any choice in the matter really. Your existence is completely wrong as it is.'_ As the pseudo Asuka said this her face hitched upward in an angry snarl for an instance before it went back to its normal impassive look. Shinji was totally dumbstruck, unable to guess what had triggered this sudden emotional outburst.  
“你尽管抱怨吧，但实际上你从未有过选择。你的存在本身就是个错误。”伪明日香说这话时，脸上瞬间闪过一丝愤怒的扭曲，随即又恢复了平常的冷漠表情。真嗣完全愣住了，猜不透是什么触发了这突如其来的情绪爆发。

'What do you mean...my existence is wrong?'  
“你这话什么意思……我的存在是错误的？”

'_Forget it. I've said to much as it is.'_  
“算了。我已经说得够多了。”

'Damn it! Why don't you ever answer my questions!'  
'该死！你为什么从不回答我的问题！'

'_First I'm not supposed to, when your usefulness runs out then maybe I'll tell you some things...only at the end of everything though. It will save you some grief at least, you wont have to dwell on it long, maybe half a second or so.'_  
'首先我不该这么做，当你没用了之后，也许我会告诉你一些事情……但那只会在一切结束的时候。至少这能让你少些痛苦，你不必长时间纠结于此，或许只有半秒钟左右。'

Shinji was not liking where the discussion was going. He felt like he was getting close to the end of a dark tunnel and that some fearful monster was at the end, one that he'd have to battle but didn't have the nerve quite yet.  
真嗣不喜欢这场讨论的走向。他感觉自己正接近一个黑暗隧道的尽头，那里有一头可怕的怪兽在等着他，而他还没有足够的勇气去面对。

So with an almighty pull in his mind, he managed to wrench himself back towards the present. What had started out wonderful had ended in torment. He supposed he wasn't that surprised it ended that way. Though the present wasn't something that he was looking forward to either as he opened his eyes.  
于是，在他的脑海中使出巨大的力量，他设法将自己拉回到现实中。原本美好的开始却以痛苦告终。他想，自己并不惊讶事情会这样结束。尽管现在的情况也不是他所期待的，当他睁开眼睛时。

The first thing he felt was a dull throb in his right hand. Next, he realized that he was laying on a hard, cool surface and seemed fastened to it somehow. Darting his eyes left and right he started taking in his surroundings.  
首先，他感觉到右手传来一阵隐隐的抽痛。接着，他意识到自己躺在一个坚硬而冰冷的表面上，似乎被某种方式固定住了。他迅速左右扫视，开始观察周围的环境。

He was in a room that was not unlike his normal white room, though there was a significant amount of equipment around him to blow the circuit breaker in an average house. Monitors of every kind were position around him with several tables next to him. Shinji craned his neck to try and see what was on the tables, but found that his neck didn't want to move. Squinting down at his neck, he saw that a metal ring had been fastened around it. He suspected that the other parts of his body had similar objects pinning him to the hard operating table, for thats what he suspected he was on now. What were the doing? Dissecting him?  
他身处一个房间，与平常的白色房间颇为相似，但周围大量的设备足以让普通家庭的断路器跳闸。各种监视器环绕着他，旁边还有几张桌子。真嗣伸长脖子试图看清桌上的东西，却发现脖子动弹不得。他眯起眼睛看向自己的脖子，发现一个金属环固定在那里。他猜测身体的其他部位也有类似的物体将他固定在这张坚硬的手术台上，这就是他现在所怀疑的。他们在做什么？解剖他吗？

Everything came back to him. The vision, the subsequent attempt of the rape and his fury and blood lust as he prevented it, the moment afterwards while he cradled Asuka in his arms. He remembered now why his right hand felt like he had smashed it repeatedly into a brick wall.  
一切记忆都回来了。那个幻象，紧接着的强奸未遂和他阻止时的愤怒与嗜血欲望，以及事后他怀抱着明日香的那一刻。现在他终于明白为什么自己的右手感觉像是反复砸在砖墙上一样。

So he was at Nerv...right? Well, it made sense to think that. But how many days had gone by since then? For he couldn't remember waking up before now. Had they drugged him? If they thought he was going to be uncooperative then he figured they would.  
所以他是在 NERV...对吧？嗯，这样想合情合理。但自从那以后过去了多少天呢？因为他现在才刚刚醒来，之前的记忆一片空白。他们给他下药了吗？如果他们认为他会不合作，那么他猜他们会这么做。

Squinting around the room again he finally noticed that he was covered in wires. Metallic wires with white pads to hold them in place seemed to be position appropriately around his body. He felt two on his head, several on his arms and legs, and possibly three on his chest. Brain waves...heart beat...what else could they be looking at? His blood maybe? That last one made sense if they suspected he had been contaminated.  
再次眯眼打量房间，他终于注意到自己身上布满了电线。金属线带着白色垫片，似乎恰当地固定在他身体的各个部位。他感觉到头上有两根，手臂和腿上各有几根，胸前可能还有三根。脑电波...心跳...他们还在观察什么呢？也许是血液？如果他们怀疑他被污染了，最后一个猜测倒是说得通。

So he had exhibited angel powers huh? He wasn't sure who was more scared: himself, or everything person that knew what he had done, though with the exception of Asuka he supposed. He had remembered how Misato shunned away from him while they had walked towards the helicopter.  
所以他展示了天使般的力量，是吧？他不确定谁更害怕：是他自己，还是所有知道他所做之事的人，尽管除了明日香，他猜想。他记得在走向直升机时，美里是如何避开他的。

He heard a door slide open...  
他听到一扇门滑开了……

"No...no, I'll be fine. We've taken sufficient precautions so something like that won't happen. ...The commander specifically asked me to talk to him alone, so your presence here is unnecessary. Yes there are cameras in the room. If something should happen you may come in. ...Very well then."  
不……不，我会没事的。我们已经采取了足够的预防措施，所以那种事不会发生。……指挥官特别要求我单独和他谈谈，所以你在这里是不必要的。是的，房间里有摄像头。如果发生什么事，你可以进来。……那就这样吧。

Shinji, though still slightly disoriented was able to place the voice as Ritsuko's. What had she ment by questions?  
尽管仍有些迷茫，真嗣还是辨认出了那是律子的声音。她所说的‘问题’是什么意思？

As her face came into view, Shinji noticed that her voice seemed to be expressionless. If she had any fear for him, she was hiding it expertly.  
当她的面容映入眼帘时，真嗣注意到她的声音似乎毫无感情。如果她对他有任何恐惧，她都隐藏得滴水不漏。

"Shinji...can you hear me?"  
“真嗣……你能听到我说话吗？”

Unwillingly he replied back with a low, "...Yeah."  
他无奈地低声回应，“……嗯。”

"I'm sorry that all these," she hesitated, "precautions are necessary. But I'm sure you can understand how worried we all are about you."  
“很抱歉这些……”她顿了顿，“预防措施是必要的。但我相信你能理解我们大家有多担心你。”

'Worried about yourself more like,' thought Shinji bitterly.  
"“更像是担心你自己吧，”真嗣苦涩地想。

"Anyway...since you're awake now I was hoping that we could talk for a while."  
"总之...既然你现在醒了，我希望我们可以聊一会儿。"

"About what? You know about myself then I do. What could you possibly learn from talking to me?"  
"聊什么？你对我了解得比我对自己还多。你还能从我这里学到什么？"

Ritsuko completely disregarded his question and asked, "How do you feel?"  
律子完全无视了他的问题，问道："你现在感觉如何？"

"Like concrete is encasing my entire body."  
"就像混凝土包裹了我的全身。"

"So you can't move." "所以你动不了。"

"Thats what I just said."  
"我刚说的就是这个。"

"Okay then...do you have anything you would like to know?"  
"好吧……你有什么想知道的吗？"

"Plenty, though I'm sure you'd answer not even half of them, so I'll just ask instead what day it is."  
"很多，不过我确信你连一半都不会回答，所以我还是直接问今天几号吧。"

"Its Wednesday, you have been out for nearly two days."  
"今天是星期三，你已经昏迷将近两天了。"

"Keeping me sedated?" "让我一直处于镇静状态？"

Ritsuko avoided eye contact with him; he got the picture.  
律子避开了他的目光；他明白了她的意思。

"Now then...do you feel and different then you did two weeks ago."  
"那么现在...你感觉和两周前有什么不同吗？"

Shinji frowned for a second but saw no reason why he shouldn't answer her question. "Not in the slightest."  
真嗣皱了皱眉，但没看出有什么理由不回答她的问题。“一点也不。”

"Physically and _mentally?"_  
“身体和心理上？”

"Nope feels pretty much the same," replied Shinji with a sarcastic smirk. He was gonna make this as tough as possible for her.  
"“没有，感觉几乎一样，”真嗣带着讽刺的微笑回答。他打算让她尽可能地感到困难。”

"How did you learn about Asuka's...close encounter then?"  
"你是怎么知道明日香的那次...亲密遭遇的？"

Her question took Shinji aback slightly, but at least he saw that she was disgusted at what could have happened.  
她的提问让真嗣稍感意外，但至少他看出她对可能发生的事情感到厌恶。

"Premonition, I guess." He had chosen the wrong choice of words.  
"预感吧，我想。"他选错了用词。

"And have you been having these premonitions frequently?"  
"你经常有这些预感吗？"

Again her words caught him slightly by surprise. Hesitating for a second he said, "I call them more of dreams...but whatever"  
她的问话再次让他略感意外。他犹豫了一瞬，答道：“我更愿意称之为梦境……但无论如何。”

"So then you dreamed about this happening?"  
"那么你是梦到这件事会发生吗？"

"I wasn't sleeping...but I suppose I could have passed out."  
"我并没有在睡觉...但我想我可能是昏过去了。"

"What did you see?" "你看到了什么？"

This question did not catch Shinji off guard, snarling back his answer he said, "You don't want to know."  
这个问题并没有让真嗣措手不及，他咆哮着回答道：“你不会想知道的。”

Ritsuko winced for a second, whether it was his tone of voice or what he had said, he didn't know.  
理津子微微皱眉，不知是因为他的语气还是他所说的话，他不得而知。

"No, I suppose we can leave that particular detail out. So? How did you find where she was?"  
“不，我想我们可以省略那个细节。那么？你是怎么找到她的位置的？”

Shinji honestly had to think about that for a minute. He remembered recognizing the window that she had been standing in front of.  
真嗣认真地想了一会儿。他记得自己认出了她所站的那扇窗户。

"...I don't remember that part very well...I mean," he swallowed. "I heard her...or not her, but what could have been her. Its hard to explain. I heard the her that could have been...what I had seen back in the apartment. Her voice just sorta...carried me onward I guess..."  
"...那部分我记得不太清楚了...我是说，" 他咽了咽口水。"我听到了她...或者说，可能是她的声音。这很难解释。我听到了那个可能成为的她...就是我在公寓里看到的那个她。她的声音就像是...带着我继续前进，我想..."

"You act as though you were able to see the future."  
"你表现得好像你能预见未来似的。"

"...Its not the future, just a possible outcome of the future. The future is changing almost every second based on the actions of humans."  
"...这不是未来，只是未来可能的一种结果。未来几乎每时每刻都在根据人类的行为而变化。"

"And so your actions canceled that possible outcome of her dying."  
"所以你的行为取消了那个她可能死亡的结果。"

"Yes." "是的。"

"Have you had anything similar to this before?"  
"你以前有过类似的经历吗？"

Without hesitating, Shinji replied, "No...this is the first time that I've ever experience this, at least as far as the whole future thing goes."  
毫不犹豫地，真嗣回答道：“没有...这是我第一次经历这种事，至少就整个未来而言是第一次。”

"Let me ask you this...were you conscious of what you were doing to that man?"  
"让我问你这个问题...你对那个人所做的事，你当时有意识吗？"

Shinji had to hold back a snarl as he replied, "Man is a very loose way to describe that bastard, but yeah, I fully understood what I was doing when I killed him."  
真嗣强忍着咆哮回答道：“用‘人’来形容那个混蛋实在是太宽松了，但没错，我完全明白我在杀他时做了什么。”

"Did you enjoy it?" "你享受吗？"

Shinji looked blankly back at her before he said, "I part of me did sure, I wanted to make it as painful for him as possible before he died. Would I do it again? Certainly!"  
真嗣茫然地回望着她，然后说道：“我的一部分确实这么想过，我想在他死前尽可能让他痛苦。我会再做一次吗？当然会！”

"So then you know that you used something similar to an AT-field."  
“那么你就知道你使用了类似于 AT 力场的东西。”

"I don't know why you call it something _similar_ to an AT-field. Thats what I used. Even I recognized that."  
“我不知道你为什么说它类似于 AT 力场。那就是我用的东西。连我自己都认出来了。”

"...Fine then. How did you use it."  
"...好吧。你是怎么使用它的。"

"Beats me. I just got really pissed, and felt like killing him. Suddenly his arm went flying. After that it felt like my body was on autopilot. All I really had to do was think about hurting him and my...whatever I have inside, would do the rest."  
"我也不清楚。我只是非常愤怒，想要杀了他。突然间他的手臂就飞了出去。之后我感觉自己的身体像是自动操作一样。我只需要想着伤害他，我体内的...无论是什么力量，就会完成剩下的工作。"

Ritsuko sat still for a few seconds before slouching in a nearby chair and pulling out a cigarette.  
律子静静地坐了几秒钟，然后颓然坐在旁边的椅子上，掏出一支烟。

"Do you have any idea what's wrong with me," Shinji suddenly asked after a few moments of silence.  
"你知道我有什么问题吗？" 沉默片刻后，真嗣突然问道。

Ritsuko puffed away on her cigarette for a few moments before stabbing it into a nearby ashtray.  
律子抽了几口烟，然后将其捻灭在附近的烟灰缸里。

"No...we don't. And thats the worrisome part. Your brain shows no sign of mental contamination and we can't pick up a trace of pattern blue in your blood."  
"不...我们不知道。这才是令人担忧的部分。你的大脑没有显示出精神污染的迹象，我们也没能在你的血液中检测到蓝色模式的痕迹。"

"So, what is your diagnose."  
"那么，你的诊断是什么？"

Shrugging Ritsuko said, "I don't have one currently. I have theory's, but thats all they are."  
耸了耸肩，赤木律子说：“目前我还没有确切的诊断。我有一些理论，但那只是理论而已。”

"I'd rather hear an explanation than none at all. I'm more worried about whats wrong with myself more than everyone else probably is."  
"我宁愿听到一些解释，而不是什么都没有。我更担心自己的问题，可能比其他任何人都更甚。"

"That may be true I suppose...okay then. First I theorize that this has something to do with Eva Unit 01. You must have realized yourself, that every time you step out of that thing, something changes in you. Something that you might not have thought before, or something that you would have reacted differently to if you had not been piloting it. Furthermore, you seem much more aggressive and produce subsequent mood swings that can be...rather harsh at times. I've also noticed that your brain waves have changed since your first synchronization test."  
"那可能是真的，我想……好吧。首先，我推测这与 Eva 初号机有关。你自己一定也意识到了，每次你从那东西里出来，你都会有所变化。有些事情你以前可能没想过，或者有些事情如果你没有驾驶它，你的反应会不同。此外，你似乎变得更加好斗，随之而来的是情绪波动，有时可能会相当激烈。我还注意到，自从你的第一次同步测试以来，你的脑波已经改变了。"

"...So what...?" "……所以呢……？"

"Unit 01 is affecting you somehow. We can dispute that fact. Don't forget that the Eva had forced a direct synchronization with you several times by connecting directly with your nervous system. It is possibly that during those times, though few, you inadvertently took some of the Eva's blood. Don't forget that the Eva's are a byproduct of the first angel, Adam."  
"初号机在以某种方式影响你。这一点我们可以争论。别忘了，Eva 曾多次通过直接连接你的神经系统，强行与你进行同步。有可能在这些时候，尽管次数不多，你无意中吸收了一些 Eva 的血液。别忘了，Eva 是第一使徒亚当的副产品。"

"I have angel blood in me then?"  
"那我体内有天使的血统吗？"

"Its a possibly, and it may not be that specific way which I just listed. There are several other theory's but that is the most plausible at his moment."  
"这有可能，而且不一定是我刚才提到的那种方式。还有其他几种理论，但目前看来这个最合理。"

"Does Misato know about this."  
"美里知道这件事吗？"

"Very vaguely. The commander gave me specific orders to act as though I was the only one to know about this...and some of the specifics."  
"非常模糊。指挥官给了我具体的命令，要我表现得好像只有我知道这件事...以及一些细节。"

"I'm some what glad..." "我有些庆幸..."

"You should be...she was worried."  
"你应该庆幸...她很担心。"

"How did you guys even know where I was?"  
"你们怎么知道我在哪儿的？"

"...We had...been keeping tabs on you since the last angel incident."  
"...自从上次天使事件后，我们...一直在关注你。"

"You what!" "你们在搞什么！"

Shrugging Ritsuko said, "You have to look at it from our perspective. You had gotten out of control during that last battle and we still weren't one hundred percent sure you were contamination free. So we had Nerv person watching you twenty four-seven, even when Misato wasn't there."  
耸了耸肩，律子说道：“你得从我们的角度来看待这件事。你在那场战斗中失控了，而且我们仍然不能百分百确定你没有受到污染。所以我们安排了 NERV 的人员全天候监视你，即使美里不在的时候也是如此。”

Shinji clenched his teeth together. "So somebody had been following me that day."  
真嗣咬紧了牙关。“所以那天有人在跟踪我。”

"Yes, when he saw what you were going to do he decide to inform us. Actually, we had been ready to call you back to run some tests when the call came. Misato had actually been trying to dissuade us from that. She wasn't able to do much though when the order from the commander came down to detain you."  
“是的，当他看到你要做什么时，他决定通知我们。实际上，我们正准备打电话叫你回来进行一些测试，就在这时电话来了。美里其实一直在试图劝阻我们不要这么做。但当指挥官下达命令要拘留你时，她也没能做太多。”

Shinji grimaced, "As usual my father is the root of all this."  
真嗣皱了皱眉，“一如既往，我父亲是这一切的根源。”

Ritsuko was silent for minute as Shinji continued to glare angrily up at the ceiling. Finally breaking the silence he said, "So, am I going to be stuck on this table forever or are you going to throw me into solitary confinement. Can I at least get something to eat-"  
律子沉默了一会儿，而真嗣继续愤怒地瞪着天花板。最终打破沉默，他说道，“那么，我要一直躺在这张桌子上吗，还是会被关进单人牢房？至少能给我点吃的吗——”

"I'm not quite done with questions, I've got something to ask you...more personal."  
“我还没问完问题，我有点私人的事要问你...更私密些。”

Shinji sighed and said, "Whatever gets this over with faster."  
真嗣叹了口气，说道：“只要能快点结束，什么都行。”

"Firstly, and I'm sure you realized it yourself, your...powers, are strictly controlled by your emotions at this point. Before, when you were angry, you were able to do that. Its not likely that you will be able to control them at all in the first place."  
“首先，我相信你自己也意识到了，你的……能力，目前完全受你的情绪控制。之前，当你生气时，你就能做到那样。一开始你就不太可能控制它们。”

"So I can never get angry again?"  
“那我以后再也不能生气了吗？”

"...Well for now we've managed to suppress it I think. We had developed some...chemicals to use in case we got the chance to examine an angels body. That chemical is currently flowing through your blood stream. It should be enough to suppress your powers for now."  
"...嗯，目前我们似乎已经成功压制了它。我们研发了一些...化学物质，以备有机会检查使徒的身体时使用。那种化学物质现在正流经你的血液。它应该足以暂时抑制你的能力。"

"So I'm a human guinea pig, big deal."  
"所以我成了人类小白鼠，有什么大不了的。"

"Secondly...I had something that I wanted to ask you...regarding Asuka."  
"其次...我有些事情想问你...关于明日香。"

Shinji's eyes...which had been rather glazed and unfocused as though he hadn't cared about the conversation up till this point, suddenly shot upwards and then narrowed into slits.  
真嗣的眼睛...之前还显得相当呆滞且心不在焉，仿佛他对这场对话一直漠不关心，此刻却突然向上抬起，然后眯成了细缝。

Trying to suppress a snarl, he said, "What about her..."  
他试图压抑一声咆哮，问道：“她怎么了...”

Ritsuko hesitated for a second. This was something that she hadn't wanted to ask, but knew that it was important nonetheless."  
律子犹豫了一秒钟。这是她本不想问的问题，但她也知道这至关重要。

"Shinji...this is rather personal, so I'm just going to be blunt about it. We don't know if whatever you have is transferrable...if it is well, with regards to Asuka's well being-"  
"真嗣...这有点私人，所以我直说了。我们不知道你身上的东西是否可传染...如果是的话，那么，关于明日香的安危——"

Shinji finally got what she aiming at and his entire body surged forward, straining at the steel rings that bound his body to the cold surface. Ritsuko had barely moved a muscle. She had been expecting this type of reaction.  
真嗣终于明白了她的意图，整个身体猛地向前一冲，被钢环束缚的身体紧贴着冰冷的表面。律子几乎没动一下。她早就预料到了这种反应。

"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN ASKING SOMETHING LIKE THAT!"  
"你他妈的问这种问题是什么意思！"

"Shinji please calm down. It is a legitimate question and I need to know-"  
"真嗣，请冷静下来。这是一个合理的问题，我需要知道——"

"I DON'T CARE. GO BACK TO MY BASTARD OF A FATHER AND TELL HIM HE CAN SHOVE HIS QUESTION STRAIGHT UP HIS-"  
"我不在乎。回去告诉我那混蛋父亲，让他把他的问题直接塞进他的——"

"Would you prefer it if I asked Asuka myself-"  
"如果我亲自问明日香，你会更愿意吗——"

If the chemical that had been administered to Shinji's body, had failed, Ritsuko's head would be rolling around on the floor right now with a fountain of blood spewing out of it.  
如果注射进真嗣体内的化学药物失效了，那么现在律子的头颅恐怕正滚落在地板上，鲜血如喷泉般四溅。

Shinji's body surged upward again and Ritsuko was surprised that the steel braces held. Even if Shinji wasn't able to use an AT-field she suspect that his hands would work just as well to break a persons neck. She doubted that the security she had left outside the door would be able to make it to her in time and would probably be wheeling her out on a stretcher.  
真嗣的身体再次猛地向上挺起，律子惊讶于那些钢制支架竟然承受住了。即便真嗣无法使用 AT 力场，她怀疑他的双手同样能轻易扭断一个人的脖子。她怀疑门外留下的安保人员能否及时赶到，或许他们只能用担架将她抬出去。

Shinji meanwhile was in a total maniacal rage.  
与此同时，真嗣正处于一种完全疯狂的暴怒之中。

"IF YOU SO MUCH AS EVEN THINK OF BRINGING THAT UP WITH HER, I'LL TEAR YOUR-"  
"你要是敢在她面前提那件事，我非撕了你不可-"

"Shinji calm down already, and just answer yes or no!"  
"真嗣，冷静点，直接回答是或不是就行了！"

"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK! DO YOU HONESTLY THINK WE'VE DONE THAT!"  
"你他妈的以为呢！你真以为我们会那么做吗！"

"I have to have an answer. Think about it this way, if whatever changed with you was integrated into your DNA, then if you fathered a child you would have a chance of passing on that gene."  
"我必须得到一个答案。这么想吧，如果发生在你身上的变化已经融入了你的 DNA，那么如果你有了孩子，你就有可能将这个基因传给下一代。"

"Then why the hell do you automatically associated that with Asuka!"  
"那你他妈的为什么立刻就联想到明日香！"

"Because she is the closest human that you could love."  
"因为她是你最亲近的、你可能会爱上的人类。"

"Bull Shit!" "胡说八道！"

"Just answer the question..."  
"就回答问题……"

"...No! Is that good enough for you, or do you want to take a semen sample?"  
"……不！这样你满意了吗，还是你想取个精液样本？"

Ritsuko face twisted upward into a grimace. "If you weren't going to cooperate than I had considered that option."  
律子脸上扭曲成一副痛苦的表情。“如果你不打算合作，那我确实考虑过那个选项。”

Shinji snorted while Ritsuko sighed.  
真嗣哼了一声，而律子叹了口气。

"Are we done here?" Shinji asked abruptly.  
“我们这里结束了吗？”真嗣突然问道。

"...For now yes...though I need you to cooperated with me on something."  
"...目前是的...不过我需要你配合我做一件事。"

"...What?" "...什么？"

"I have been asked to see what adverse effects, if any at all, Unit 01 has on you currently. I'm going to release the lock on the bracers so I want you to promise me that you wont run away, or try to injure any personal. There are armed guards outside that wont hesitate to pin you to the floor."  
"我被要求检查零号机对你目前是否有任何不良影响。我要解除腕带上的锁定，所以请你答应我不要逃跑，也不要试图伤害任何人。外面有武装警卫，他们不会犹豫将你按倒在地。"

"Did my father ask you to do this also."  
"我父亲也让你这么做的吗？"

Ritsuko hesitated for a second but said, "Yes..."  
律子犹豫了一瞬，但还是答道：“是的……”

"Why do you always act like his lapdog."  
“为什么你总是表现得像他的跟屁虫。”

Ritsuko ignored his question.  
律子无视了他的问题。

"Okay...I'm releasing the locks...don't try anything."  
"好了...我正在解开锁...别耍花招。"

"Like I could," mumbled Shinji as he felt the blood flowing more properly in his arms and legs. Sitting up properly he glanced around the room once before settling on Ritsuko's face. She was not smiling, rather, she seemed nervous now that Shinji had been released from his restraints. This made him feel slightly better, at least she feared him properly now.  
"我哪敢啊，""真嗣咕哝着，感觉到血液更顺畅地流过他的四肢。他坐直身子，环顾了一下房间，然后将目光定格在律子的脸上。她没有微笑，相反，现在真嗣被解开束缚后，她显得有些紧张。这让他感觉稍微好些，至少她现在对他有了适当的畏惧。"

Grinning slightly he said, "Lead the way, doctor Akagi."  
他微微一笑，说道：""带路吧，赤木博士。""

---

There really wasn't much left of them so she settled on chewing her lips instead...though that was slowing starting to break down also. Asuka's nails, which she normally kept moderately long, were now little more than stubs; she had even made one of them bleed. She had lost track of time somehow, even though it had barely been two days since she had last seen Shinji.  
实际上，他们所剩无几，于是她转而咬住嘴唇...尽管这也渐渐开始崩溃。明日香平时留得适中的指甲，如今已变得短小不堪；她甚至弄破了一个，流了血。她不知怎的失去了时间感，尽管距离上次见到真嗣才不过两天。

She was constantly irritable to the point that Misato didn't want to spend longer than a few minutes in her company. Her classmates probably got it worst though, as they had to put up with her for eight hours. She had snapped earlier that day, throwing her notebook in the teachers face and kicking Touji's desk over...with him still in it of course. He was now in the hospital with a significant concussion. She had been lucky to not get suspended and wondered if Misato hadn't intervened. She hated that for some reason.  
她持续处于易怒状态，以至于美里不想在她身边多待哪怕几分钟。她的同学们可能遭受最严重，因为他们得忍受她八个小时。那天早些时候，她爆发了，把笔记本扔到老师脸上，还踢翻了东治的桌子...当然，他还在桌子里。他现在因严重脑震荡住进了医院。她侥幸没有被停学，不禁怀疑是不是美里从中斡旋。她讨厌这种感觉，不知为何。

Currently, she was pacing back and forth in the living room, the T.V. blaring in the background. The thing that kept eating at her was the fact that she had been forbidden to see Shinji, even when she had promised him that she would. What didn't they want her to see? Was his condition so bad that he wasn't allowed to see anyone? Were they running tests on him like he had said back in the...  
眼下，她正在客厅里来回踱步，电视在背景中大声播放着。让她心烦意乱的是，她被禁止见真嗣，尽管她曾向他承诺过会去。他们不想让她看到什么？他的状况真的那么糟糕，以至于不能见任何人吗？他们是不是像他之前说的那样，在他身上做着实验……

She tried her best to ignore that. It was bad enough that she woke up every night to that same nightmare drenched in a cold sweat. The last thing she needed was to think about it while she was awake. She was already in a terrible state.  
她尽力不去想这些。每晚醒来都伴随着那个同样的噩梦，浑身冷汗，已经够糟糕的了。她最不需要的就是在清醒时还去想这些。她已经处于极度的痛苦之中。

She was still steadfast against her opinion that whatever...phase Shinji was going through, as she put it, had no harm in it whatsoever. She had been a little afraid when he had shown outright cruelty, but it was more the fact that she was worried that he would have changed, that he would have been different than the Shinji that she knew. Those few moments alone together had blown all those worries out of her mind. Though would he be the same after he returned from Nerv? They would certainly examine him and try to determine if he had been contaminated. What would they do if he was? Would they lock him up in some soft room and feed him through a small pocket in the door? He wasn't insane!  
她依然坚定地认为，无论真嗣正在经历什么...阶段，正如她所说的，没有任何害处。当她看到他表现出明显的残忍时，她确实有些害怕，但更多的是担心他会改变，变得不再是她所认识的那个真嗣。那几次单独相处的时刻已经消除了她所有的担忧。尽管他回来后还会是原来的样子吗？NERV 肯定会对他进行检查，试图确定他是否受到了污染。如果他真的被污染了，他们会怎么做？会不会把他关在某个软房间里，通过门上的小孔喂食？他并没有疯！

As Asuka's mind continued to sort through these questions, Misato got off the phone with Ritsuko and entered the living room.  
当明日香继续思考这些问题时，美里结束了与律子的电话，走进了客厅。

"Asuka-" "明日香——"

"What?" She snapped back, not even looking at Misato's face.  
“什么？”她猛地回过神来，甚至没有看美里的脸。

"I just got off the phone with Ritsuko at Nerv..."  
"我刚和 NERV 的律子通完电话..."

This briefly halted Asuka's pacing.  
这让明日香暂时停下了踱步。

"So...what?" "所以...怎样？"

"Shinji's awake..." "真嗣醒了..."

"By awake you mean that he hasn't been awake till now." She said all this very slowly.  
"你说他醒了，是指他之前一直没醒。" 她慢条斯理地说道。"

"They had to sedate him," Misato explained patiently, "they had to run some tests on him...examine his brain waves and what not. They didn't think he'd like that."  
"他们不得不给他注射镇静剂，" 美里耐心地解释道，"他们需要对他进行一些测试...检查他的脑电波之类的。他们觉得他不会喜欢那样。"

"So they did it without his consent," snarled Asuka.  
"所以他们未经他同意就做了这件事，"明日香咆哮道。

Misato hesitated, "I suppose you could look at it that way."  
美里犹豫了一下，"我想你可以这么看。"

"So now what are they going to do with him," said Asuka trying to keep her voice at a normal volume.  
"那他们现在打算怎么处置他，"明日香努力让自己的声音保持正常音量说道。

"They want to run some tests with Unit 01 and him. They believe that his state might have been influenced somehow by Unit 01. Also they want me down there to witness it...and they wanted to know if you could be present."  
"他们想用零号机和他进行一些测试。他们认为他的状态可能受到了零号机的影响。此外，他们希望我到场见证...并且想知道你是否能出席。"

"...So what...I'm going to see him through a gigantic piece of glass?"  
"...所以...我要通过一块巨大的玻璃看他？"

"Isn't it better than nothing? You've been anxious ever since...he left, and now you have a chance to see him and your not going to take it?"  
"总比什么都没有好吧？自从他离开后，你就一直焦虑不安，现在有机会见到他，你却不打算抓住这个机会吗？"

"Its not the same as standing in front of him."  
"站在他面前是不一样的。"

"But he'd be glad that you were there. I'm sure he'd feel better if he knew you were watching."  
"但他会很高兴你在那里。我确信如果他知道你在看着，他会感觉好些。"

Asuka eyed Misato, slightly unsure whether she should take the invitation or not. In truth, she wanted to, but she thought there were other implications behind her being there. If she was there Shinji might feel better, but then again, if she was there he might read it another way that she was something that they were able to control him with. She hated the idea that Shinji might be forced into something that he doesn't want to do because she was basically a hostage. Even so, her desire to see Shinji won over her fears.  
明日香打量着美里，略微不确定是否应该接受这个邀请。实际上，她想去，但她认为她出现在那里可能有其他含义。如果她在那里，真嗣可能会感觉好些，但另一方面，如果她在那里，他可能会解读为她是一种用来控制他的手段。她讨厌真嗣可能因为她是某种人质而被强迫做他不想做的事情的想法。即便如此，她想见真嗣的愿望战胜了她的恐惧。

"Fine, I'll go." "好吧，我去。"

"I'm sure it will mean a lot to him," said Misato.  
"我相信这对他意义重大，"美里说。"

Asuka almost snorted. "It better, this is a favor for him and when he returns I'm going to be sure he pays me back."  
明日香几乎嗤之以鼻。"最好如此，这是为他做的，等他回来我一定要让他还我这个人情。"

Misato rolled her eyes knowingly as she turned to get ready.  
美里心领神会地翻了个白眼，转身准备起来。

---

It felt familiar...and what? Good? That was something he never expected to feel while sitting inside an entry plug. It was warm also...more warm than normal, like human blood he guessed, and something that he had smelled before in there but never really gave any thought to it. Why did he think it smelled like-  
这种感觉很熟悉……还有，是什么呢？好？坐在插入栓里他从未想过会有这种感觉。也很温暖……比平时更温暖，像是人类的血液，他猜想，还有在那里闻到过但从未真正在意过的某种气味。为什么他会觉得那气味像——

"Shinji you ready?" Came Ritsuko's voice over the intercom.  
“真嗣，准备好了吗？” 律子的声音通过对讲机传来。

"...What? ...Right, sure whenever."  
"...什么？...好吧，当然，随时都行。"

"We're gonna take this slow so just listen to what I tell you and we can get this over with. I'm just as anxious as you are."  
"我们要慢慢来，所以你只需听我的指示，我们就能尽快结束。我和你一样紧张。"

Shinji rather doubted that but closed his eyes and started concentrating. He had been told that the purpose of this test was to first: see if he could still sync with Unit 01, and second: to see if any changes happened to him while he was inside the entry plug. This last thing worried him. By changes...well that left a lot open for discussion. They way he saw it, they could be mental or physical.  
真嗣对此表示怀疑，但还是闭上眼睛开始集中精神。他被告知这次测试的目的首先是：看看他是否还能与初号机同步，其次是：看看他在插入栓内时是否发生了任何变化。这最后一点让他担忧。所谓变化...嗯，这有很多可讨论的空间。在他看来，这些变化可能是心理上的，也可能是生理上的。

"Inserting entry plug into Unit 01...stabilizers in place...umbilical cord attached...pilot life signs normal, brain waves normal, heartbeat normal...no irregular patterns."  
将插入栓插入初号机...稳定器就位...脐带电缆连接...驾驶员生命体征正常，脑波正常，心率正常...无异常模式。

Ritsuko nodded once at the stream of information and said to Shinji, "Okay...just do what you normally do and try syncing with the Eva. We have a team on standby in case something happens so..."  
律子对这一连串信息点了点头，对真嗣说：“好的...就按平常那样做，尝试与 Eva 同步。我们有团队随时待命，以防万一...”

Shinji heard a small quaver in her voice as she trailed off and for a minute felt that he had heard a small amount of compassion in her voice. He had long resigned to the fact that she only cared about scientific aspects and disregarded human life for those ideals. Now he thought his father was the one who was forcing her to do these things.  
真嗣听到她声音中微弱的颤抖，当她话音渐弱时，有那么一刻，他感觉自己听到了她声音中的一丝同情。他早已接受了这个事实：她只关心科学层面，为了这些理想而忽视人的生命。现在他觉得是他的父亲在强迫她做这些事。

Concentrating had become second nature to him. In truth, he felt no different while trying to sync with Unit 01 then he would while lounging on the couch, or reading a book. The same concept still applied. Or maybe he was so engrossed in what he was doing he didn't recognize his surroundings. Course, his surroundings weren't overly exciting.  
集中精神对他来说已是家常便饭。实际上，他在尝试与初号机同步时，感觉和躺在沙发上或读书时并无二致。原理依旧相同。或许他太过专注于手头的事情，以至于忽略了周围的环境。当然，他的环境也并不那么令人兴奋。

Pushing his mind further into the depths of his subconscious he brought up several memories of his childhood, none of them very happy. He had always been somewhat of a loner. Instead he conjured up a mental image of what Asuka would do when he was allowed to return. His mind tacked on the possible _if,_ though he brushed it off. If he was lucky, and after avoiding the beating she'd be sure to unleash, maybe he'd be able to convince her to cook dinner for once. He had never asked that, afraid that she only ever wanted to make breakfast occasionally. Though he wasn't complaining, he enjoyed the breaks that she gave him and even suspected she liked cooking sometimes, if only to keep up her skills.  
他将思绪更深地推入潜意识深处，唤起了几段童年的记忆，没有一段是愉快的。他一直有点孤僻。相反，他想象着当自己被允许回去时，明日香会怎么做。他的脑海中附加了可能的“如果”，尽管他很快将其抛诸脑后。如果他幸运的话，躲过了她肯定会施加的殴打，也许他能说服她偶尔做一次晚饭。他从没提过这个要求，担心她只是偶尔想做早餐。虽然他并不抱怨，他享受她给他的休息时间，甚至怀疑她有时喜欢做饭，哪怕只是为了保持技能。

He felt his mind slip suddenly and knew that he was going off track with his imagination. He had momentarily forgoten where he was.  
他突然感到思绪飘忽，意识到自己的想象力已经偏离了轨道。他一时忘记了身在何处。

'_You're a real airhead sometimes. Can you keep your thoughts to yourself. I don't enjoy having to listen to a humans sniveling love story.'_  
'你有时候真是没脑子。能不能把你的想法藏好？我可不想听一个人类的哭哭啼啼的爱情故事。'

Shinji's brain waves didn't even change at the sudden intrusion of the '_voice_,' as he had come to know it.  
对于这个突然闯入的'声音'，他已经习以为常，真嗣的大脑波纹甚至没有一丝变化。

'What are you doing here,' he thought?  
'你在这里做什么？'他心想。

'_Your mind was irritating me, so I told you to shut up. But what is this...another synchronization test?'_  
'你的思维让我烦躁，所以我让你闭嘴。但这是什么...又一个同步测试？'

'Something like that. I don't even know for sure myself...'  
'类似那样。我自己也不太确定...'

The voice was silent for a minute before Shinji heard a low murmur and then a mumble of, '_Ah...so thats what happened.'_  
声音沉默了一会儿，然后真嗣听到一声低语，接着是含糊的咕哝：'啊...原来如此。'

'What are you talking about?'  
“你在说什么？”

'_You. Finally awoke and all that. Couldn't keep your emotions in check I see. Well, I can see why they are curious about you, you are unique after all. A human with an angels powers, well, if they can harness that power...'_  
“你，终于醒了，还有那些情绪失控的表现。看来我明白他们为什么对你好奇了，毕竟你是独一无二的。一个人类拥有天使的力量，如果能掌握这种力量……”

'They want to harness my powers...why?'  
“他们想利用我的力量……为什么？”

'_Even you should be able to see that. A human that is able to project a corporeal-'_  
'即便是你，也应该能看出来。一个能够投射出实体化 AT 力场的人类——'

'Cor...what?' '实体...什么？'

'_It means that your AT-field has distinct form and shape, not the like the AT-field that all humans carry. Don't forget, if all humans were to lose there AT-fields they would technically become one, because a humans AT-field makes them unique and distinguishes them from all other humans. If AT-fields no longer exist, than all humans would be considered the same. I believe that this what your father considers as his version of Instrumentality.'_  
'这意味着你的 AT 力场具有明确的形式和形状，不像所有人携带的那种普通 AT 力场。别忘了，如果所有人类都失去了他们的 AT 力场，他们从技术上讲就会变成一个整体，因为人类的 AT 力场使他们独一无二，区别于其他所有人。如果 AT 力场不复存在，那么所有人类都将被视为相同。我相信这就是你父亲所认为的他版本的‘人类补完计划’。'

'My...father? Do you...know him? And what do you mean Instrumentality?'  
'我的...父亲？你...认识他吗？还有，你说的‘工具化’是什么意思？'

'_I do not know your father the way you do...lets just say that I have a reliable source that knows him well. Instrumentality...or Human Instrumentality is a plan that Seele plans to implement, though what it is...I'm not sure. Maybe they plan on becoming the gods of this world. Your fathers version differs significantly though. He wants to be rejoined with his loved one.'_  
'我并不像你那样了解你的父亲...这么说吧，我有一个可靠的消息来源，他对他非常了解。工具化...或者说人类工具化，是 Seele 计划实施的一个方案，虽然具体是什么...我不确定。也许他们打算成为这个世界的神。但你父亲的想法则大相径庭。他想要与心爱之人重新结合。'

'My mother?' '我的母亲？'

'_I did not say that...but yes. That is most likely correct.'_  
'我并没有那么说...但确实，那很可能是正确的。'

'And somehow I'm involved in all this?'  
'而我不知怎么地卷入了这一切？'

'_You could say that you are the key to it all.'_  
'可以这么说，你是解开这一切的关键。'

'Why am I a key-"  
'为什么我是一把钥匙-"

'_Because you are, simple as that. If you have to, curse the fact that you were brought into this world.'_  
'因为你就是，就这么简单。如果非要抱怨，那就怪你被带到这个世界上来吧。'

Something similar stirred in Shinji's mind, something that he had heard recently too.  
某种类似的念头在真嗣的脑海中涌动，那是他最近也听到过的。

"What do you-" "你这是-"

His entire mind surged forward and than backwards as though he had just suffered a mental whiplash. His head hurt like crazy. It felt like somebody had stabbed a white, hot poker on his skull, burning away the hair and flesh, leaving the brain scarred.  
他的整个思维猛地向前冲，随即又向后甩，仿佛刚刚遭受了一次精神上的鞭打。他的头疼痛欲裂，感觉像是有人将一根炽热的烙铁刺入他的头骨，烧焦了头发和皮肉，留下大脑的伤痕。

His eyes burst open suddenly and he immediately felt a stinging sensation on his right side. Looking down at his arm, he saw that from his finger tips to his elbow a bluish tinge had started to develop under his skin. Meanwhile, all around him the LCL fluid was boiling to the point that he felt he was being cooked in a pot roast. He heard frantic yelling over the intercom, but wasn't able to distinguish any of the voices. What he wouldn't give to just fade out of reality right now.  
他的眼睛突然睁开，立刻感到右侧一阵刺痛。低头看向手臂，他发现从指尖到肘部，皮肤下开始出现蓝紫色斑块。与此同时，周围的 LCL 液体沸腾到了他感觉自己像是在炖锅中被烹煮的程度。他听到对讲机里传来慌乱的喊叫声，却无法分辨任何声音。他多么希望此刻能从现实中消失。

Maybe he had just gotten his wish.  
或许他刚刚才实现了自己的愿望。

His entire body was disappearing.  
他的整个身体正在消失。

He gasped loudly as he watched the tips of his fingers slowly become transparent and then disappear all together. His entire body started to disintegrate into nothingness.  
他大声喘息着，眼看着指尖逐渐变得透明，最终完全消失。他的整个身体开始分解成虚无。

Meanwhile on the outside, Ritsuko was desperately trying to reverse the process, though with little luck. Unit 01 was not responding. Misato and Asuka were therefore forced to watch helplessly as Shinji slowly dissolved in front of there eyes.  
与此同时，在外界，律子正拼命试图逆转这一过程，但运气不佳。初号机毫无反应。因此，美里和明日香只能无助地看着真嗣在他们眼前慢慢消融。

For Shinji it didn't hurt, it just felt like he was, fading away with the wind. It didn't really seem so bad of an option really. He had sometimes wished he would just fade away with the wind, when he was particularly hurt by someone. Course he would be leaving behind his friends, but they could continue on without him. They would find somebody else to pilot Unit 01, or would he become one with Unit 01 and become another voice. Maybe that wouldn't be so bad. At least he could bother the next pilot till his...spirit or whatever passed on.  
对真嗣来说，这并不痛苦，只感觉自己像是在随风消逝。这其实并不算太糟糕的选择。有时，当被某人特别伤害时，他曾希望自己能随风消逝。当然，他会留下朋友们，但他们可以继续前行，没有他。他们会找到其他人来驾驶初号机，或者他会与初号机合为一体，成为另一个声音。也许那不会太糟糕。至少他可以烦扰下一位驾驶员，直到他的...灵魂或其他什么东西消散。

Everything faded to white.  
一切渐渐化为白色。

---

And so, he suspected his new life to start, though what he had expected was a lot different that what he was seeing. Where the hell was this anyway?  
于是，他怀疑新生活即将开始，尽管他所期待的与眼前所见大相径庭。这到底是什么鬼地方？

Everything was white. Left, right, up, down, no matter where he looked all he saw was white. Was this what the after life was supposed to be? A whitish place that went on forever with no end in sight. Or was this simply something that he was imagining.  
一切都是白色的。左看右看，上看下看，无论他望向何处，眼前尽是白色。难道这就是所谓的来世？一个无边无际、永无尽头的白色空间。还是说，这只是他脑海中的幻想。

"You're not imagining this," said a soft voice from behind him. "This is all very real...or as real as things in here can be."  
“你并非在幻想，”一个柔和的声音从他身后传来，“这一切都非常真实……或者说，在这里的事物所能达到的真实程度。”

Shinji turned slowly to the sound of the soft feminine voice.  
真嗣缓缓转身，循着那柔和的女性声音望去。

At first he thought he was looking at Rei, the similarities where eerie. She had dark brown hair that barely touched her shoulders. Her eyes were a soft brown that seemed closer to chocolate than anything  
起初他以为自己看到的是绫波，两人的相似之处令人毛骨悚然。她有着深棕色的头发，刚刚触及肩膀。她的眼睛是柔和的棕色，更接近巧克力色而非其他。

'My eyes,' Shinji reminded himself.  
'我的眼睛，' 真嗣提醒自己。

For he was looking at a mother that had died many years before, his mother.  
因为他正看着一位多年前就已去世的母亲，他的母亲。

Very hesitantly, Shinji opened his mouth, blinked twice and said, "Mother?"  
慎之介非常犹豫地张开嘴，眨了两次眼，说道：“母亲？”

She smiled back at him and nodded once before opening her arms to greet him.  
她微笑着回应他，点了点头，然后张开双臂迎接他。

The next few moments were lost to Shinji as he dashed forward and was brought into a comforting hug that he had never experienced, even in Asuka's tenderest moments. The hug of a mother was like nothing else, and you couldn't really blame him. He had never known who his mother was, or what she really looked like. Now though he saw the similarities which he had missed the first time. The shape of their noses, how theirs lips both seemed to draw upwards in the same way when they smiled. Shinji even recognized the simplest curve of the ears.  
接下来的几秒钟，真嗣仿佛迷失了自我，他向前冲去，被一个从未体验过的安慰拥抱所包围，即便是在明日香最温柔的时刻也未曾有过。母亲的拥抱是无与伦比的，你不能真的怪他。他从未知道自己的母亲是谁，或者她真正的模样。但现在，他看到了第一次错过的一些相似之处。他们的鼻子形状，他们的嘴唇在微笑时都以同样的方式上扬。真嗣甚至认出了耳朵最简单的曲线。

"Is this real?" He suddenly said. If it wasn't, he never wanted this dream to end.  
“这是真的吗？”他突然问道。如果不是，他永远不希望这个梦结束。

His mother, Yui chuckled softly and said, "I suppose it is. I never thought that this was possible."  
他的母亲，唯轻声笑道：“我想这是真的。我从没想过这有可能。”

"But what is this," said Shinji as he took a step back trying to tell if something had changed in his surroundings.  
"但这是什么，" 真嗣说着后退一步，试图判断周围是否有变化。

"Somewhere inside the Eva, I suppose."  
"我想是在 Eva 的某个内部吧。"

"You know about the Eva?"  
"你知道 Eva 的事？"

"Course, I helped design them."  
“当然，我参与了设计。”

"You did what?" “你做了什么？”

Yui smirked slightly before she said with a sigh, "Gendo didn't tell you much I suppose."  
Yui 微微一笑，叹了口气说：“Gendo 大概没告诉你多少吧。”

"He rarely tells me anything at all. He can be very stubborn," murmured Shinji.  
"他很少告诉我任何事情。他可以非常固执，" 真嗣低声说道。

"So I've known," she said with a slight frown. "Anyway I have no idea how long I'll be able to talk to but first I think I'll get some stuff out of the way. ...You must hate me Shinji..."  
"所以我已经知道了，" 她微微皱眉说道。"无论如何，我不知道还能和你聊多久，但首先我想把一些事情说清楚。...你一定恨我吧，真嗣..."

Shinji had to do double take at this. "What? How could I hate you?"  
真嗣对此不得不再次确认。"什么？我怎么会恨你？"

"...You mean...you don't?"  
"...你是说...你不？"

"Don't what?" "不什么？"

"Never mind...forget I said anything."  
"算了...当我没说。"

Shinji nodded and was silent for a minute. He had about a hundred questions to ask his mother, each he felt more time consuming than the last.  
真嗣点点头，沉默了一会儿。他有一百个问题想问他的母亲，每个问题都感觉比上一个更耗时。

"How am I here? Last I remember I was inside the Eva...disappearing."  
“我是怎么来到这里的？我记得最后我在 Eva 里面...消失。”

"I think your molecules were separated piece by piece. Most likely your entire genetic makeup is still floating in the sea of LCL fluid."  
“我想你的分子是被一片片分离的。很可能你的整个基因构成仍然漂浮在 LCL 溶液的海洋中。”

Shinji raised an eyebrow in confusion but said nothing. Even though he was the son of scientists, he was not good at science himself.  
真嗣困惑地挑了挑眉，却什么也没说。尽管他是科学家的儿子，自己却并不擅长科学。

There was an uncomfortable silence for a minute. What were they really supposed to talk about after never really talking to each other. Shinji didn't know where to begin.  
一阵尴尬的沉默持续了一分钟。他们从未真正交谈过，现在该谈些什么呢？真嗣不知道从何说起。

"How come you're here mom?" He suddenly blurted out.  
“妈妈，你怎么会在这里？”他突然脱口而出。

"Ah...I suppose you could call me something like Eva Unit 01's spirit."  
"啊...我想你可以称我为 Eva 初号机的灵魂。"

"...Huh?" "...啊？"

"You know that I died in an experiment, right."  
"你知道我在一次实验中死去，对吧。"

"Yes..." "是的..."

"The experiment was Unit 01's first activation. It went berserk and killed my human body, though I found that my spirit was able to reside in Unit 01. Since then I've stayed here. It's because I exist here that you are able to pilot it."  
“实验是零号机第一次启动。它暴走了，杀死了我的肉体，但我发现我的灵魂能够寄居在零号机中。从那时起，我就一直留在这里。正是因为我的存在，你才能驾驶它。”

"Why is that?" “为什么？”

"The children after Second Impact are the only ones that are able to pilot the Eva's. But for them to be able to pilot them there has to be some spirit inhabiting them, someone that loves them. The same applies for the other Eva's, with the exception of Unit 00. Its nothing but an empty shell."  
“第二次冲击后的孩子们是唯一能驾驶 EVA 的人。但为了让他们能够驾驶，必须有某种灵魂寄居其中，有某个爱他们的人。其他 EVA 也是如此，除了零号机。它只是一个空壳。”

"What is resting in Unit 02?"  
"零二号机里躺着的是什么？"

"I don't know. That experiment happened after I had already passed on. You'd have to ask the pilot of the 02."  
"我不清楚。那次实验发生在我去世之后。你得去问零二号机的驾驶员。"

Shinji could just imagine that conversation with Asuka.  
真嗣几乎可以想象和明日香进行那场对话的情景。

"How are you doing though outside of piloting an Eva? School going okay? Grades fine? I hope you have plenty of friends."  
"除了驾驶 Eva 之外，你过得怎么样？学校还好吗？成绩怎么样？希望你有很多朋友。"

Shinji sighed as her motherly instincts kicked in. "I'm fine, better than I've been in a while really. I've got a guardian who looks after me and several friends."  
真嗣叹了口气，她的母性本能被激发了。“我很好，真的比之前一段时间好多了。我有一个监护人照顾我，还有几个朋友。”

"School?" "学校？"

"So-So," said Shinji holding back a smile.  
"一般般吧," 真嗣说着, 忍住笑意。

"Well as long as you pass I suppose I'll be happy. Now you should probably return to your own place."  
"好吧, 只要你及格, 我想我会很高兴的。现在你或许应该回你自己那儿去了。"

"No. I want to talk with you more."  
"不, 我想和你多聊聊。"

Shaking her head, Yui said, "You don't belong here. As much as I want to continue talking to you, I know that this place isn't for you. You have people on the outside that are worried about you. One in particular seems to be infuriated by your absence.  
"摇了摇头，Yui 说道，“你不属于这里。尽管我希望能继续与你交谈，但我知道这个地方并不适合你。外面有人担心你，尤其是有一位似乎对你的缺席感到愤怒。”

Shinji could only guess who that was.  
Shinji 只能猜测那人是谁。

"I want to ask you something before I left."  
“在我离开之前，我想问你一件事。”

"Better make it quick." “最好快点搞定。”

"Okay...do you know if another spirit is residing in here, because I here...voices sometimes when I'm piloting the Eva."  
“好吧……你知道这里是不是还住着另一个灵魂吗？因为我驾驶 Eva 的时候……偶尔会听到一些声音。”

Yui's eyes narrowed. "I think I know what you mean. Sometimes my existence is pushed aside, it feels strange. That could be what you are talking about. But it never stays around for long, its always constantly moving. Sometimes I feel it, sometimes I don't. I would be wary of it though. There is strong malice coming from what I've felt before."  
“绫波的眼睛眯了起来。“我想我知道你的意思。有时候我的存在会被挤到一边，感觉很奇怪。那可能就是你说的那种情况。但它从不会停留太久，总是不停地移动。有时候我能感觉到，有时候又感觉不到。不过我得提醒你，我从之前感受到的气息中察觉到了强烈的恶意。”

"I'll keep that in mind. Thank you mom...for everything."  
"我会记住的。谢谢妈妈……为了所有的一切。"

"I don't see why you should be thanking me. If anything...you should be...well, I suppose you should be on your way. Best not keep the others waiting too much longer. It looks as though they might forcefully try to get you out."  
"我不明白你为什么要谢我。如果有什么的话……你应该……嗯，我想你应该上路了。最好不要让其他人等太久。看起来他们可能会强行把你弄出去。"

Shinji snorted. If it was Asuka decision she'd crack open the entry plug and search for him herself.  
真嗣哼了一声。如果是明日香的决定，她会打开插入栓亲自去找他。

Smirking slightly, he noticed his body become transparent, and waved a finally farewell to his mother before he reappeared inside the entry plug.  
他微微冷笑，注意到自己的身体变得透明，向母亲挥了最后一下手告别，随后便出现在驾驶舱内。

---

Everything was a blur as he reappeared. He felt many arms grabbing and touching him as he was forcefully hauled out of the entry plug. Suddenly he felt a sharp metal object pierce his skin before he was fully conscious and saw the syringe release the chemical into his body. First thing out of the entry plug and they were already afraid of him. He thought this silently as he slowly passed out.  
当他再次出现时，一切都模糊不清。他感到许多手臂抓住并触摸着他，被强行从驾驶舱中拖出。突然间，他感到一个尖锐的金属物体刺入皮肤，在他完全清醒之前，看到针筒将化学物质注入体内。刚出驾驶舱，他们就已经害怕他了。他默默地想着，渐渐失去了意识。

---

Wow his body was numb. Every nerve in his body felt split and frayed. All his senses were completely switched off. What in the world had happened?  
哇，他的身体完全麻木了。每一根神经都像是被撕裂和磨损。所有的感官都彻底关闭了。到底发生了什么？

He had apparently spoken this out loud, because he got a returning answer.  
他显然是不小心把这话说了出来，因为随即就得到了一个回应。

"A lot of stuff really, you're okay though...baka."  
“真的很多事，不过你还好……笨蛋。”

His hearing wasn't apparently completely gone as he could easily tell who this was by the tone of there voice.  
他的听力显然还没有完全丧失，仅凭对方的语调就能轻易判断出是谁。

"Hey, Asuka." “嘿，明日香。”

"Yeah, I'm here." "是啊，我在这儿。"

"To bad I can't see you."  
"可惜我看不见你。"

"Which is a relief for me because I look terrible."  
"对我来说倒是件好事，因为我现在看起来糟透了。"

"I didn't think that was possible."  
"我没想到那可能。"

Asuka's breath hitched slightly but she said, "You really are an idiot."  
明日香的呼吸微微一滞，但她还是说："你真是个白痴。"

"Maybe I am..." "也许我是吧..."

Shinji suddenly felt something soft grasp his hand which was laying lifeless next to the bed.  
真嗣突然感觉到一只柔软的手握住了他那只无力地躺在床边的手。

"That you?" “是你吗？”

"...No one else is in here."  
“……这里没有别人。”

"Sorry, I can't feel your hand very well is all."  
"抱歉，我只是感觉不到你的手。"

"With good reason. Your arms look as though you're a heroin addict. I can't believe how many drugs they pumped into you. They only stopped after Misato yelled at them."  
"这很正常。你的手臂看起来就像个海洛因成瘾者。真不敢相信他们给你注射了多少药物。直到美里对他们大吼，他们才停下来。"

"Glad that she's on my side."  
"很高兴她站在我这边。"

"Yeah, me too." "是啊，我也是。"

They were silent for a minute, just glad to be near each other once again. Though both knew that this was a very temporary thing. There time apart might be longer this time.  
他们沉默了一会儿，只是很高兴能再次靠近彼此。尽管两人都知道这非常短暂。这次分开的时间可能会更长。

"Sorry that I took so long to get here," said Asuka suddenly.  
"抱歉，我花了这么久才来到这里，" 明日香突然说道。

"Don't blame yourself, I'm sure you tried your best. Not that it would have mattered much since I was out until today though."  
"别自责了，我相信你已经尽力了。不过，既然我今天才回来，那也没太大关系。"

"Yeah, I suppose." "是啊，我想是的。"

"How long do you have to stay?"  
"你还要待多久？"

"Not much longer...I was given a few minutes thanks to Misato."  
"不会太久了...多亏了美里，我被允许有几分钟时间。"

"I'll have to thank her when I get the chance."  
"有机会我得谢谢她。"

"Hmm," said Asuka nodding her consent.  
"嗯，" 明日香点头表示同意。"

Letting out a low sigh, Shinji turned towards the sound of Asuka's voice. He thought he even saw the outline of her face. But maybe that was just his mind playing tricks on itself.  
叹了口气，真嗣转向明日香声音的方向。他觉得自己甚至看到了她的脸庞轮廓。但也许那只是他的大脑在捉弄自己。

"How you faring...by yourself I mean?"  
"你一个人过得怎么样？"

Shrugging Asuka said, "Okay...nights or kinda rough. Hikari has been helping me a little. Even Kensuke and Touji have been kinder than usually."  
明日香耸耸肩说："还行吧...晚上有点难熬。光最近帮了我一些。就连真治和阿薰也比平时更体贴了。"

"Good, or I'd have to get angry with them."  
"那就好，不然我可要对他们发火了。"

"Thats not a good idea."  
"那不是个好主意。"

Shinji laughed silently, "No, I suppose that wouldn't be."  
真嗣默默地笑了，"不，我想那不会是。"

"I'm just glad that you're still the same. I had worried that you might have...changed."  
"我只是很高兴你还是老样子。我曾担心你可能会……变了。"

"Didn't I tell you I'd stay the same person that you knew?"  
"我不是告诉过你，我会是你认识的那个人吗？"

"Yes...but you can't blame me for being worried."  
"是的...但你不能怪我担心。"

"No...I supposed I can't."  
"不...我想我不能。"

The door opened and Shinji heard Misato's voice.  
门开了，真嗣听到了美里小姐的声音。

"Asuka...time to go." "明日香...该走了。"

"...M'kay," she mumbled silently.  
"...好吧，"她小声嘟囔着。"

Shinji squeezed Asuka's hand briefly before letting it slide out of his grasp, waved in the direction that he thought the two of them were, and laid back down in his bed.  
真嗣短暂地握了一下明日香的手，然后任由它从自己的掌握中滑落，朝着他认为两人所在的方向挥了挥手，又躺回了床上。

A short time later, Ritsuko returned with another sinister looking syringe, bringing Shinji into a dreamless sleep.  
不久后，律子带着另一支看起来不祥的注射器回来了，让真嗣陷入了无梦的睡眠。

### Chapter 14: Despair
第十四章：绝望

**Okay so yeah this is a day late. Maybe its better if I do this on Christmas though...eh whatever. As I post this chapter it has literally been (counts off on fingers) twelve hours since I started working on this. As for my one shot...its done and all, but needs to be proofread. So that wont be out till sometime later today. And for ever body that wanted a lemon you got your wish. Anyway I'm gonna go to sleep now and wake up in the next four hours.  
好吧，是的，这章晚了一天。也许在圣诞节做这个更好……呃，无所谓了。当我发布这一章时，实际上从我开始工作到现在已经（数着手指）十二个小时了。至于我的短篇……已经完成了，但需要校对。所以今天晚些时候才会发布。而对于那些想要柠檬（暗示色情内容）的读者，你们如愿以偿了。无论如何，我现在要去睡觉了，四个小时后醒来。**

---

Shinji wasn't sure how long he had been sleeping, but it didn't feel like a full day, in fact, it felt like only a few hours had gone by since his visit with Asuka. At least they had decided to let him sleep on a bed this time instead of an operating table.  
真嗣不确定自己睡了多久，但这感觉不像是一整天，实际上，自从他和明日香见面后，感觉只过了几个小时。至少这次他们决定让他睡在床上，而不是手术台上。

He was in his usual white room, though it might not have been the usual, since he suspected that there was more then just one. Looking down at his arms, he didn't seen any cords or wires, just the scars from when he received the glass shards.  
他身处他那惯常的白色房间，尽管这可能已非往常，因为他怀疑不止一个这样的房间。低头看着自己的手臂，他没有看到任何线缆或电线，只有那些因玻璃碎片而留下的伤疤。

Swinging his leg over the side of his bed, he was determined to get out of this depressing room and find something to eat, when the door slid open and Ritsuko walked in.  
他跨过床沿，决心离开这个令人沮丧的房间，找点东西吃，就在这时，门滑开了，律子走了进来。

"...Shinji?" "...真嗣？"

"I'm not doing anything wrong, so you don't have to act so defensive. I was just thinking of looking for some food."  
“我没有做错什么，所以你不必这么戒备。我只是想去找点吃的。”

"Oh..right. Well, before that, I was hoping you could accompany me on a tour of some sorts."  
"哦...对。那么，在那之前，我希望你能陪我参观一下这里。"

"I really don't care to see more of Nerv then I already have."  
"我实在不想再看更多关于 NERV 的东西了。"

"I'm sure you will be interested in this particular thing."  
"我相信你会对这个特别的东西感兴趣的。"

Shinji stood, staring at Ritsuko before sighing in resignation, he said, "Lead the way."  
真嗣站着，盯着律子，然后叹了口气，无奈地说：“带路吧。”

---

Shinji had certainly never been this far down into Nerv headquarters, he thought as the elevator they were on continued to descend deep into Central Dogma.  
真嗣确信自己从未深入过 NERV 总部这么远，他想着，随着他们所在的电梯继续向中央教条深处下降。

After passing the thirty-third floor, Shinji was becoming suspicious.  
过了第三十三层后，真嗣开始起了疑心。

"What exactly is down here?" He asked with a slight edge in his voice.  
"这里到底有什么？" 他的声音中带着一丝尖锐。

"...Something that I figured was worth while for you to see."  
"……我觉得你值得一看的东西。"

"Does my father know about this?"  
"我父亲知道这件事吗？"

Ritsuko hesitated for a second before she finally said, "No, the commander does not know that I am bringing you here, though he does know about this dark secret kept at Nerv."  
赤木律子犹豫了一会儿，最终说道：“不，指挥官并不知道我带你来这里，尽管他确实知道 NERV 隐藏的这个黑暗秘密。”

"Who all knows about this besides yourself?"  
“除了你之外，还有谁知道这件事？”

"The commander and vice commander."  
“指挥官和副指挥官。”

"Misato doesn't?" "美里不知道吗？"

"...She suspects, but her clearance isn't high enough to get her down here."  
"……她有所怀疑，但她的权限不够，无法让她来到这里。"

Shinji felt slightly fearful suddenly. What could be so bad that they had to keep it away from even Misato?  
真嗣突然感到一阵恐惧。究竟是什么事情严重到连美里都要瞒着？

As the lift came to a sudden jolting halt, the rot-iron gates slowly opened, and Shinji stepped out into a wide opened room.  
当电梯突然猛地停下，锈迹斑斑的铁门缓缓打开，真嗣踏入了一个宽敞的房间。

After taking several looks around, Shinji realized what he was looking and said, "This is-"  
环顾四周几眼后，真嗣意识到他所见之物，说道：“这里是——”

"The failed attempts at creating the first Evangelion."  
“初号机制造失败的尝试。”

Giant pits opened up in the Earth, in which the failed corpses of previous Evangelion lay there, slowly decomposing. Barely any flesh was left on the disfigured bones of the bodies and Shinji suddenly felt sick. Hardly anything was left except for the bones, which consisted largely of the skull and the backbone and several limbs which seemed to be some sort of strange mutation.  
大地上裂开了巨大的坑洞，里面躺着先前失败的 EVA 残骸，正缓慢地腐烂。扭曲的骨架上几乎不剩什么肉了，只剩下骨头，主要是头骨、脊椎和几根看似某种奇怪变异的肢体。真嗣突然感到一阵恶心。除了这些骨头，几乎什么都没剩下。

"This is awful," mumbled Shinji.  
“这太可怕了，”真嗣喃喃自语。

"This is the reality of what has transpired here. Some might consider what we conducted an atrocity, we consider it as a scientific breakthrough."  
“这就是这里发生的事实。有些人可能认为我们所做的是一种暴行，而我们则视之为科学上的突破。”

"But the Eva's are still organisms. They must have...some sort of feelings."  
"但 Eva 仍然是生物体。它们一定有...某种感觉。"

"Irrelevant. The Evangelions were derived from Adam, the first angel, they are nothing more then our tools."  
"无关紧要。Eva 是从第一个使徒亚当衍生而来的，它们不过是我们的工具罢了。"

"Then what about the souls of the people that reside in them?"  
"那住在它们体内的人们的灵魂呢？"

Ritsuko froze for a second, momentarily surprised that he knew about something so sensitive as that.  
律子愣了一瞬，没想到他竟然知道如此敏感的事情。

"Where did you hear that?"  
“你从哪儿听说的？”

"Doesn't matter...people's souls are inside of those things."  
“无所谓了……那些东西里面装着人们的灵魂。”

"Dead people's souls," Ritsuko reminded him.  
"死者的灵魂，" 律子提醒他。

"Are we just supposed to forget about them?"  
"我们就该把他们忘了吗？"

"Some things are better left forgotten," said Ritsuko, ending the conversation and continuing forward.  
"有些事，忘了反而更好，" 律子结束了对话，继续前行。

Shinji grumbled silently as he trailed behind her, trying to ignore the corpses on either side of him.  
真嗣默默地抱怨着，跟在她身后，试图忽视两侧的尸体。

Eventually the wide room filled with the corpses of past Eva's came to an end and they stopped outside a door. Swiping her key card through the slot, Ritsuko punched in several numbers, and the door swung open to admit her.  
最终，布满过往 EVA 尸体的宽敞房间走到了尽头，她们停在了一扇门外。律子用钥匙卡刷过插槽，输入了几位数字，门便应声而开，让她进入。

They were in a high ceilinged room now that seemed to stretch upward forever. As Shinji took a step forward he looked to his left and right, noticing the small island in the middle while a watery substance seemed to be surrounding it.  
现在他们身处一个高耸的房间，天花板似乎直通天际。真嗣向前迈了一步，左右环顾，注意到中间的小岛被一种水状物质环绕着。

"What is this place?" “这是什么地方？”

Taking several steps forward, Ritsuko said, "This is what is known as the Black Moon, the resting place of the second angel, Lilith."  
向前走了几步，律子说道：“这就是所谓的黑月，第二使徒莉莉丝的安息之地。”

As Shinji heard her words, what was nailed to a cross in the center of the island soon became apparent. It looked like a white, faceless, legless giant, with a mask over what looked like an upside down triangle, with seven opened eyes adorning it. Where a stomach should have been, the skin was disfigured, with large bulges popping out of the side. Shinji then realized that a fluid seemed to be leaking from this apparent wound.  
听到她的话，真嗣很快意识到岛上中央被钉在十字架上的东西是什么。它看起来像一个白色、无脸、无腿的巨人，戴着一副面具，形状像倒三角形，上面有七只睁开的眼睛。本该是腹部的地方，皮肤畸形，侧面鼓起大包。真嗣随后意识到，似乎有液体从这个明显的伤口中渗出。

"This is an angel?" "这是个天使？"

"Correct," Ritsuko replied.  
"没错，" 律子回答道。"

"But what is it doing here?"  
"但它在这里做什么？"

"Lilith was found buried underneath Japan. The Geofront was build upon it and Nerv created an entire city to hide its existence from the public. The fluid that you see leaking from its chest cavity, is in fact LCL fluid, the same that we use to supply the Evangelions."  
"莉莉丝被发现埋藏在日本地下。地底空洞就是建在其上方，而 NERV 为了隐藏其存在，建造了整个第三新东京市。你们看到的从它胸腔渗出的液体，实际上是 LCL 液体，与我们供给 EVA 的相同。"

"But why here?" "但为什么选在这里？"

"Tokyo-3 is the safest and possibly dangerous place on Earth right now. The reason the angels appear here is because of Lilith, they are drawn to its presence, but we have three Evangelions here, which makes us more then prepared enough."  
"第三新东京市是目前地球上最安全也可能是最危险的地方。使徒出现在这里是因为莉莉丝，它们被其存在所吸引，但我们这里有三个 EVA，这让我们准备充分。"

As Shinji continued to look up into the eerie face of Lilith he asked, "Why are you showing me this?"  
当真嗣继续抬头凝视着莉莉丝那诡异的面孔时，他问道：“你为什么要让我看到这些？”

Shrugging, Ritsuko said, "For my own purposes, and I believe you deserve to know after everything that you have been put through. I'm sorry about the whole confinement, but there really is nothing I can do."  
理津子耸了耸肩，说道：“出于我自己的目的，而且我认为在经历了这一切之后，你有权知道真相。对于整个监禁的事情，我很抱歉，但我真的无能为力。”

"Yeah, I know," he mumbled.  
“嗯，我知道。”他咕哝道。

They stood there for a while longer looking at the soulless face of Lilith.  
他们又在那里站了一会儿，凝视着莉莉丝那毫无生气的面孔。

"I have something else that I wanted to tell you while we're down here, which is probably the main reason why I brought you down here. Try not to get...agitated as I know you probably will be furious."  
“我还有件事想在我们在下面的时候告诉你，这大概也是我带你下来的主要原因。尽量别……激动，我知道你可能会非常愤怒。”

"...What is it?" “……什么事？”

"After a failed experiment The United States of America has relinquished its grip on Eva Unit-03; they have decided to send it to us. Due to the writings of the Vatican Treaty each country is allowed to have a maximum number of three Evangelion at any given time, this limits the country in questions power. Because we will be gaining control of Unit-03, the commander has deemed it necessary to place Unit-01 in storage."  
"在一次失败的实验后，美利坚合众国放弃了 Eva 三号机的控制权；他们决定将其移交给我们。根据梵蒂冈条约的规定，每个国家在任何时候最多只能拥有三台 Eva，这限制了相关国家的力量。由于我们将接管三号机，指挥官认为有必要将初号机封存。"

"Why is that?" “为什么？”

"...Honestly, we don't know how your powers will be affected during actual combat, and furthermore you may pose a threat to the other pilots."  
"...老实说，我们不知道你的能力在实战中会受到怎样的影响，而且你可能会对其他驾驶员构成威胁。"

"Why did you expect me to get angry? Its not like I care that much to begin with."  
"你为什么期待我会生气？我本来就没那么在意。"

"I'm...not quite done. The original pilot for the synchronization was supposed to be you, but after that last test, the commander decided to have Asuka pilot it."  
"我...还没完全准备好。原本同步测试的驾驶员应该是你，但在上次测试后，指挥官决定让明日香来驾驶。"

Shinji could feel the ringing settle in his ears almost immediately after she spoke.  
真嗣几乎在她说话的同时就感觉到耳中响起了嗡鸣声。

"What was that?" "那是什么？"

"Shinji...you promised you would't get angry."  
"真嗣...你答应过不会生气的。"

"...How could I not be angry! Does my father want me to break his fucking neck?"  
"...我怎么能不生气！我父亲是想让我扭断他那该死的脖子吗？"

Ritsuko could feel the change in his aura and his anger boil over to the point where she felt something constricting her trachea.  
律子能感觉到他气场中的变化，他的愤怒沸腾到了让她感到气管被勒紧的程度。

"...Shinji!" "...真嗣！"

At her sudden scornful words, Shinji's shoulders relaxed slightly, passing a hand over his head, he wiped the sweat off his brow and glanced in the direction of Lilith. For some reason he felt a presence that felt oddly familiar.  
听到她突如其来的嘲讽，真嗣的肩膀微微放松，他用手抹过头顶，擦去额头的汗水，并朝莉莉丝的方向瞥了一眼。不知为何，他感觉到一种异常熟悉的气息。

Shaking off the feeling of deja vu, he looked over at Ritsuko and said, "Sorry...when is the test supposed to take place?"  
他甩开那种似曾相识的感觉，转向赤木律子问道：“抱歉……测试预计什么时候进行？”

"Tomorrow at noon." “明天中午。”

"Am I allowed to be there?"  
"我可以去那里吗？"

"...No. You weren't even supposed to know about this."  
"……不行。你甚至不应该知道这件事。"

"Right," said Shinji moodily. Turning around he walked past Ritsuko, and towards the lift to take him back up to the surface.  
"好吧，" 真嗣心情不佳地说道。他转身走过律子，朝电梯走去，准备返回地面。

Asuka got the news that she would be the test pilot for Unit 03 later that day, and she wasn't entirely thrilled. She was afraid that her synchronization rate would have dropped dramatically; she had been reliving the rape every night, except that Shinji didn't rescue her. Her eyes were bloodshot now and she had black bags under her eyes from the lack of sleep.  
明日香得知当天晚些时候她将成为 03 机体的测试驾驶员，这消息并未让她完全兴奋。她担心自己的同步率会急剧下降；每晚她都在重复经历那场强奸，只是这次真嗣没有来救她。她的眼睛布满血丝，因缺乏睡眠眼下出现了黑眼圈。

Resting her head on the couch, she buried her face in a pillow and thought about what she had been told by Misato.  
她将头靠在沙发上，把脸埋进枕头里，回想着美里告诉她的事情。

She knew that Shinji had been the original test pilot for Unit 03, but something had changed and she had been chosen.  
她知道真嗣原本是 03 机体的测试驾驶员，但情况发生了变化，她被选中了。

Rolling onto her back, she bit her lip in frustration at what she was supposed to do tomorrow. She was afraid that she would have a mental breakdown.  
她翻身仰躺，咬着嘴唇对明天该做的事感到沮丧。她担心自己会精神崩溃。

"Asuka?" Came a sudden voice from the doorway of the living room.  
“明日香？”客厅门口突然传来一个声音。

Asuka looked up to see Misato leaning against the door frame, with a frown creasing her brow.  
明日香抬头一看，只见美里靠在门框上，眉头紧皱。

"You okay with this," she asked.  
"你还好吧？" 她问道。

Asuka simply nodded and said, "Yeah...its fine. Its better for Shinji this way."  
明日香只是点点头，说："嗯...这样挺好的。对真嗣来说更好。"

"I could ask the commander to reevaluated his deci-"  
"我可以请求指挥官重新评估他的决定——"

"Its fine," she said in a much sterner voice.  
"没事的，"她用更加严厉的语气说道。

"Asuka...if you need to talk to me about anything you know-"  
"明日香...如果你需要和我谈什么，你知道的-"

"I'm perfectly fine," shouted Asuka. Throwing herself off the couch, she stormed passed Misato before slamming the door of her room, only to have it bounce back and rebound against the opposite wall.  
"我完全没事，"明日香大喊道。她从沙发上跳起来，怒气冲冲地从美里身边走过，猛地摔上自己房间的门，结果门又弹了回来，反弹到对面的墙上。

Flattening herself against her futon, she crushed her face against the pillow as silent tears started streaming down her face.  
她紧贴着榻榻米躺下，将脸埋进枕头里，无声的泪水开始顺着脸颊流淌。

When was this nightmare going to end?  
这场噩梦何时才能结束？

---

Asuka woke early the next morning, and hurriedly dressed to prepare to leave for Nerv. Even if she didn't want to admit it, she was extremely nervous.  
明日香第二天一早就醒了，急忙穿上衣服准备前往 NERV。尽管她不愿承认，但她感到极度紧张。

Going down the highway leading to the testing site, Asuka constantly bit her already chapped lips, and curled a loose strand of her hair around her index finger. She was constantly looking out the window, trying to judge if they were any closer.  
沿着通往测试场的高速公路行驶，明日香不停地咬着她那已经干裂的嘴唇，并用食指卷起一缕松散的头发。她不断地望向窗外，试图判断他们是否更接近目的地了。

Leaning against the window, with her chin resting in the palm of her hand she asked Misato, "Is Shinji going to be there?"  
她斜靠在车窗上，下巴搁在手掌中，问美里：“真嗣会在那里吗？”

Misato glanced over at Asuka for a second before saying, "No...he wont be. He doesn't even know about today, or the fact that he was chosen as the original pilot. You can at least understand what he would do if he learned that you were taking his place."  
美里瞥了明日香一眼，然后说：“不……他不会在。他甚至不知道今天的事，也不知道他被选为最初的驾驶员。你至少能理解，如果他得知你代替了他的位置，他会怎么做。”

"Yeah, he can be rather stubborn," mumbled Asuka.  
“是啊，他有时候挺固执的，”明日香咕哝道。

Pulling up to the contained area where the tests were supposed to be conducted, they both handed their pass cards over to security, before being sent onward.  
他们驶入测试区域，将通行卡递交给安保人员，随后被放行继续前进。

Stopping at a fork in the road, Misato waved Asuka onward while she entered a nearby tent where the monitoring equipment was being held.  
在岔路口停下，美里示意明日香继续前行，而她自己则走进了附近的帐篷，那里摆放着监控设备。

As Misato opened the flap of the tent, Ritsuko was just about to leave it. Passing by each other for a brief instance, Ritsuko whispered a few hasty words to Misato. "I told him. He seemed to appreciate it."  
当美里掀开帐篷的帘子时，律子正要离开。两人短暂地擦肩而过，律子匆匆对美里低语了几句。“我告诉他了。他似乎很感激。”

Misato gave no sign that she had heard Ritsuko's words, but was glad that she had at least listened to her request. She didn't care how she had done it, as long as Shinji was aware of what was happening she felt less guilty for putting Asuka through this.  
美里没有任何迹象表明她听到了律子的话，但她很高兴律子至少听从了她的请求。她不在乎律子是如何做到的，只要真嗣知道正在发生的事情，她对让明日香经历这一切的愧疚感就减轻了一些。

Asuka meanwhile had already changed into her plug suit and was climbing the ladder to the entry plug of Unit 03. It felt so much different, quite unlike the warmth that she was so used to while inside her own Eva. It was the first time that she felt that the Evangelion's were wrong, an abomination. She felt revolted that she was sitting inside of something that just felt so...evil."  
与此同时，明日香已经换上了插入栓服，正爬上三号机的插入栓梯子。这种感觉与她习惯的温暖截然不同。这是她第一次觉得使徒是错误的，是一种亵渎。她感到厌恶，自己竟然坐在这样一个感觉如此……邪恶的东西里面。

"Asuka...can you here me?"  
"明日香...你能听到我说话吗？"

"Perfectly fine," replied Asuka to Misato's question.  
"完全没问题，" 明日香回答了美里的话。"

"How do you feel?" "你感觉怎么样？"

Asuka hoped that Misato didn't notice the waver in her voice as she said, "Fine..."  
明日香希望美里没有注意到她声音中的颤抖，当她说：“好吧……”

"Okay. We're going to start the first phase. Just perform as you usually do in your synchronization tests and everything will be fine."  
“好的。我们将开始第一阶段。就像你在同步测试中通常做的那样表现，一切都会顺利的。”

"Right," said Asuka as she took a deep breath.  
“明白，”明日香说着深吸了一口气。

"LCL pressure at normal level, plug depth within acceptable parameters, pilot pulse and brain wave normal. Synchronization holding at seventy-four precent. No abnormalities detected."  
"LCL 压力正常，插头深度在可接受范围内，驾驶员脉搏和脑波正常。同步率保持在七十四百分比。未检测到异常。"

"Good," said Ritsuko as she ducked into the tent, standing beside Misato. "Proceed to the second stage of the test."  
"很好，" 律子一边说着一边弯腰进入帐篷，站在美里旁边。"进行测试的第二阶段。"

Asuka nodded and closed her eyes.  
明日香点了点头，闭上了眼睛。

She had done this over a thousand times, and in so many different scenarios, that she felt confident saying she could sync with an Eva while in a coma. Yet she had never found it so difficult as she did now. Maybe it was like she had thought before, the feel of the Eva was completely off. She didn't feel safe in here, she felt scared and afraid, and more then ever, she wanted Shinji to be with her, at possibly the most painful moments of her life.  
她已经这样做过上千次，在如此多的不同情境下，以至于她自信地说，即使在昏迷中也能与 Eva 同步。然而，她从未觉得像现在这样困难。也许就像她之前想的那样，Eva 的感觉完全不对劲。她在这里没有感到安全，她感到害怕和恐惧，而且比以往任何时候都更希望真嗣能陪在她身边，在她生命中最痛苦的时刻。

They said some women never overcame the trauma that was inflicted on them by a rape, Asuka could very well be leaning towards that. She had lied to Shinji about receiving help from Hikari; she had lied about Touji and Kensuke being nicer to her, because when she wasn't crying her eyes out on her pillow, she was aimlessly wandering around Tokyo-3. This usually happened while she was supposed to be in school, and amazingly, it was even starting to affect her grades.  
有人说，有些女性永远无法克服被强奸带来的创伤，明日香很可能正朝着这个方向发展。她对真嗣撒了谎，说自己从美里那里得到了帮助；她撒谎说剑介和薰对她更友好了，因为当她不在枕头上哭得眼睛红肿时，她就在第三新东京市漫无目的地游荡。这通常发生在她应该在学校的时候，而且令人惊讶的是，这甚至开始影响她的成绩。

She tried to imagine herself inside her own Eva, curled up in a ball and floating in the sea of LCL fluid, but even this wasn't enough to make he feel safe and protected. It seemed only one thing could do that, and that one thing was gone.  
她试图想象自己置身于自己的 Eva 中，蜷缩成一团，漂浮在 LCL 溶液的海洋里，但即便如此，也不足以让她感到安全和受到保护。似乎只有一件事能做到这一点，而那一件事已经消失了。

...She heard a voice...softly beckoning to her. Eyes opening slowly, she felt a shift in the LCL fluid, and thought she heard a voice whispering softly into her ear. Turning her head both left and right she didn't see anything, but she kept on hearing a voice calling to her.  
...她听到一个声音...温柔地召唤着她。眼睛缓缓睁开，她感觉到 LCL 液体的变化，仿佛听到耳边有声音轻柔地低语。她左右转动头部，却什么也没看见，但那个呼唤她的声音依旧持续着。

"_We can help you. You have nothing to fear with us here."_  
“我们能帮你。有我们在，你无需害怕。”

She suddenly felt as though she was being propelled down a long tunnel, with no end in sight. The tunnel walls on either side of her were a dark red, and the blackness that started to squeeze all around her was almost to much to bear.  
她突然感觉自己仿佛被推进了一条长长的隧道，前方看不到尽头。隧道两侧的墙壁是暗红色的，四周开始挤压过来的黑暗几乎让她难以承受。

A hand suddenly reached out from the darkness and beckoned to her. Asuka who was at her wits end, grasped it without thinking, and felt herself pulled roughly through the far corners of her mind.  
一只手突然从黑暗中伸出，向她招手。处于崩溃边缘的明日香，不假思索地抓住了它，随即感到自己被粗暴地拖过心灵的遥远角落。

Deeper blackness engulfed her, such that it seemed as though the light of the universe had suddenly gone out. She groped around frantically in the dark, trying to find any substantial object that she could latch onto and claim as her own safe haven. Eventually she tripped over her feet, falling flat on her face. She wrapped her arms around her head and willed herself to wake up, Surely this was all just a terrible dream that she was having, right? She was sleeping and she was going to wake up any second and laugh it off, right?"  
更深的黑暗吞噬了她，仿佛宇宙的光芒突然熄灭。她在黑暗中疯狂摸索，试图找到任何可以抓住的坚实物体，作为自己的避风港。最终她绊倒了，脸朝下摔倒在地。她用双臂抱住头，努力让自己醒来，这肯定只是一个可怕的梦，对吧？她在睡觉，随时都会醒来，然后一笑置之，对吧？

A white hand appeared out of the blackness, and grasped her hand pulled her towards its owner. Asuka went freely, as the light was better than anything the darkness could hold. Though as the owner of the hands face came into stronger perspective, Asuka's eyes widened as her mouth opened in a silent scream. A pure whitish face greeted her, with a lopsided red smile. The edges of its body were blurred and fuzzy, and it seemed to have a human shaped body.  
一只白皙的手从黑暗中出现，抓住她的手将她拉向其主人。明日香毫不犹豫地跟随着，因为光明胜过黑暗所能拥有的一切。然而，当那双手主人的面容更加清晰时，明日香瞪大了眼睛，张嘴无声地尖叫。一张纯白色的脸迎接着她，带着歪斜的红色微笑。它的身体边缘模糊不清，似乎有着人形的轮廓。

Asuka's silent scream had resounded loud inside the entry plug of the Eva, as the plug depth suddenly shot above one hundred.  
明日香无声的尖叫在 Eva 的插入栓内回荡，随着插入深度突然飙升至一百以上。

"What's going on, Asuka!" Shouted Misato into the intercom.  
“怎么回事，明日香！”美里对着对讲机大喊。

Asuka had been completely silent for ten seconds before she suddenly let out her high pitched screech.  
明日香沉默了整整十秒，随后突然爆发出她那尖锐的叫声。

"Plug Depth exceeding one hundred. The Pilot is in danger of mental contamination."  
"插入深度超过一百。驾驶员面临精神污染的危险。"

"Cut the synchronization between the pilot and the Eva!"  
"切断驾驶员与 Eva 之间的同步！"

"The Eva is not registering the code."  
"Eva 未响应代码。"

"Pilots brain waves are going sporadic, heart rate is accelerating rapidly."  
"驾驶员的脑波变得不稳定，心率正在迅速加快。"

"Misato!" "美里！"

Nodding at Ritsuko's quick question, Misato said, "Disengage test. Forcefully eject the entry plug out of the Eva, and remove the umbilical cord."  
美里对律子迅速提出的问题点头回应，说道：“解除测试。强行弹出插入栓，并切断脐带电缆。”

"...Eva is rejecting both of the signatures."  
"...伊娃正在拒绝这两份签名。"

"What the hell is going on-"  
"这到底是怎么回事-"

"...Ma'am I have a confirmation of pattern blue."  
"...女士，我确认了蓝色模式。"

"What?" "什么？"

"Unit 03 is being contaminated by an angel."  
"初号机正受到使徒的污染。"

"Try ejecting the plug again damn it."  
"再试一次，该死的，弹出插入栓。"

"Unable to, a glue like substance has coated itself around the entry plug making it impossible to eject."  
"无法做到，一种类似胶状的物质覆盖了插入栓入口，使其无法弹出。"

"Sudden heat source detected. Thermal energies rising. Unit 03 is breaking apart from the constraints."  
"检测到突发热源。热能正在上升。03 号单位正从束缚中解体。"

"Damn it, send a call to central command!"  
"该死，向中央指挥部发出呼叫！"

"...What should I-" "...我该怎么办-"

"Ask for support from Rei and...ask for the release of Unit 01 and its pilot Shinji Ikari."  
“请求丽支援，并要求释放初号机及其驾驶员碇真嗣。”

---

Gendo Ikari stood in his office, having just gotten off the phone with an operative from the test site. The situation had changed, but not to the point where he was readily worried.  
碇源堂站在他的办公室里，刚刚与试验场的一名特工通完电话。情况发生了变化，但还不至于让他立刻感到担忧。

"Is that you Fuyutsuki?" Asked Gendo as he heard the door open.  
“是你吗，冬月？”碇源堂听到门打开的声音问道。

"Yes." "是的。"

"What is the overall status of the situation?"  
"目前局势如何？"

"Unit 03 is on a rampages in the northern hills of Tokyo-3 and seems to be continuing south. An evacuation order has been issued."  
"03 号机在第三新东京市北部的山丘上暴走，并持续向南移动。已发布疏散命令。"

"...What else?" "...还有呢？"

"The Eva seems to have been taken over by the angel Bardiel, while the life of the pilot is unknown."  
"EVA 似乎已被天使 Bardiel 接管，而驾驶员的生命状况未知。"

"Reclassify Unit 03 as an angel and a threat to humanity. As for the life of the pilot," here he paused, turned around to face Fuyutsuki and said one word, "irrelevant."  
"将 03 号机重新分类为天使并对人类构成威胁。至于驾驶员的生命，"他顿了顿，转身面对冬月，说了一个词，"无关紧要。"

"And what about the request put in by captain Katsuragi?"  
"那葛城美里上尉的请求呢？"

Gendo took a long time to answer, thinking about the pros and cons of each action before he said, "Release Unit 01 from storage, though the pilot stays."  
源渡沉吟良久，权衡着每一步行动的利弊，最终说道：“将 01 号单位从储存中释放，但驾驶员保持不动。”

"...But then-" “……但这样一来——”

"And tell the engineers to outfit it with the dummy plug. This should be an adequate test for it."  
“并通知工程师们为其配备模拟插入栓。这应该足以对其进行一次充分的测试。”

Fuyutsuki nodded his head once, before leaving the room. Gendo meanwhile sat back down at his desk before picking up his phone and saying into the receiver, "Get me doctor Akagi."  
冬月点了点头，随即离开了房间。碇源堂则重新坐回桌前，拿起电话对着听筒说道：“让赤木博士来见我。”

---

Shinji knew that the test had started half an hour ago, but he still couldn't help but look at the clock every few minutes, hoping that the hands would suddenly start spinning faster. Sitting around and doing nothing was far worse then he had expected, and he found that he had soon worn a hole in the floor with his pacing. What he wouldn't give to be out of this shitty room.  
真嗣知道测试已经开始了半小时，但他还是忍不住每隔几分钟就看一眼时钟，希望指针能突然加速转动。无所事事地坐着比他预想的要糟糕得多，他发现自己很快就在地板上踱出了一个洞。他多么希望能离开这个糟糕的房间。

Maybe he would get his wish as he saw the door nob turn slightly, before being jerked forward, banging it off the opposite wall. Though it became clear that they weren't simply there to ask him questions.  
也许他会如愿以偿，因为他看到门把手微微转动，随后猛地向前一拉，撞到了对面的墙上。不过很快就清楚了，他们并不是来简单地问他问题的。

Four soldiers, complete with automatic weapons, stormed into his room, guns all aimed at him. Shinji stood dumbstruck at the wall of destruction that was just waiting for him to make a move that they even though as suspicious. If they did, his body would be riddled with bullet holes.  
四名士兵，全副武装，手持自动武器冲进他的房间，所有的枪口都瞄准了他。真嗣面对着这堵即将摧毁他的破坏之墙，呆若木鸡，只要他稍有可疑的动作，他们就会毫不犹豫地开枪，让他的身体布满弹孔。

Suddenly one of them motioned to the other, and what appeared to be the captain in charge, walked forward cautiously, keeping an eye on Shinji at all times.  
突然，其中一人向其他人示意，看似是队长的那位，小心翼翼地走上前，始终紧盯着真嗣。

"You're Ikari Shinji, correct?"  
“你是碇真嗣，对吧？”

"...Yes," said Shinji curtly.  
"...是的，" 真嗣简短地回答。

"You have been requested at Unit 03's testing grounds."  
"您被要求前往 03 号机测试场地。"

Shinji suddenly let out an angry snarl and yelled, "What happened to Asu-"  
真嗣突然发出愤怒的咆哮，大喊道："明日香怎么了-"

Cutting across him, the solider said, "Unit 03 is rampaging around the country side but is slowly making its way south, towards Tokyo-3. We have orders to escort or detain you as necessary as we bring you to Unit 01."  
士兵打断了他，说道：“03 号机正在乡间肆虐，但正缓慢向南移动，朝东京-3 方向前进。我们有命令护送或必要时拘留你，带你去见 01 号机。”

"I thought it was placed in storage?"  
“我以为它被封存了？”

The soldier completely ignored his question and instead said, "We don't want you to try anything Mr. Ikari, so if you can just follow us we can get this over with."  
士兵完全无视了他的问题，转而说道：“我们不希望你尝试任何举动，碇先生，只要你跟我们走，这事就能尽快结束。”

Shinji snorted, "Yeah...because I'd never try anything with soldiers watching me. Just lead the way before I feeling like venting my frustration on one of you."  
真嗣哼了一声，“是啊...因为有士兵盯着我，我怎么敢轻举妄动。快带路吧，不然我真想拿你们其中一个出出气。”

The soldiers must have taken his threat fairly seriously, because they all crouched on one knee, flipped the safety off, and put there index finger over the trigger.  
士兵们显然对他的威胁相当认真，因为他们全都单膝跪地，关闭了保险，并将食指放在了扳机上。

Sighing, Shinji said, "I was kidding..."  
叹了口气，真嗣说：“我开玩笑的...”

Seeing that he was completely laid back, the soldiers hesitantly removed their index fingers from the triggers, though they did not flip the safety back on.  
看到他完全放松的样子，士兵们犹豫地将食指从扳机上移开，尽管他们并没有重新打开保险。

"Lets go," said Shinji as he followed the soldier out the door and up several flights of stairs. He didn't think they'd want to take the elevator as they would be enclosed in a small space where they wouldn't have much room to shoot.  
“我们走吧，”真嗣说着，跟着士兵走出门，上了几层楼梯。他觉得他们不会想乘电梯，因为那样会被困在一个狭小的空间里，没有太多开枪的余地。

---

It felt oddly good to be back in the entry plug of Unit 01 after such a long while, and he also knew that his mother was watching over him silently. The only thing that made this painful was that he was supposed to battle an angel that had taken possession of an Eva's body while Asuka was inside the entry plug.  
时隔许久再次回到 01 号机的插入栓里，感觉出奇地好，他也知道母亲在默默地守护着他。唯一让人痛苦的是，他本应与一个占据 EVA 身体的使徒战斗，而明日香就在插入栓内。

Rocketing up elevator shaft number seven, he soared out through the end of it, landing cleanly on his feet. He was just inside the city limits of Tokyo-3 and the only thing that he could really see were a lot of trees and several power lines.  
他沿着第七号电梯井飞速上升，从井口一跃而出，稳稳地落在地面上。此刻他正位于东京-3 的市界内，眼前除了茂密的树木和几条高压电线，别无他物。

"Ikari-kun." “碇君。”

Rei in Unit-00 appeared next to him as she came up the same elevator shaft that he just did.  
零号机中的绫波丽紧随其后，从他刚刚离开的同一电梯井中现身，站在了他的身旁。

"Ayanami...Asuka..." "绫波...明日香..."

"...Its coming." "...它来了。"

Sure enough, the two of them saw it at the same time as it came over the hump of the hill in the distance. Large pieces of the black armor had been coated with the white, glue like substance that coated the entry plug that Asuka was stuck inside.  
果然，两人同时看到了它从远处山丘的隆起处出现。黑色装甲的大块部分被白色的、胶状物质覆盖，这种物质也覆盖了明日香被困的插入栓。

Shinji swallowed hard as the enormity of what he was supposed to do hit him, "Ayanami...how exactly are we supposed to-"  
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，当他意识到自己将要承担的重任时，"绫波...我们究竟要怎么才能..."

Unit-03 suddenly rocketed down the hill, splitting the ground as it went and upending trees. Bracing himself, Shinji felt two large arms barrel themselves against Unit 01 arms, and felt pain constrict his arms.  
三号机突然从山坡上疾驰而下，所过之处地面裂开，树木翻倒。真嗣稳住自己，感觉到两只有力的手臂猛地撞击在初号机的手臂上，一阵剧痛紧缩了他的双臂。

"Asuka..." "明日香……"

Rei appeared out of nowhere and with her progressive knife in hand, drove it into the arm, through the armor and eventually down to the soft tissue underneath. Unit 03's mouth opened wide as it bellowed in anger and pain. Knocking Shinji out of the way, it pulled the knife out of its arm and flung it at Unit 00's direction.  
绫波不知从何处出现，手持她的高频振动刀，猛地刺入三号机的手臂，穿透装甲，最终刺入下方的软组织。三号机张大了嘴，愤怒与痛苦交织地咆哮着。它将真嗣撞开，拔出插在手臂上的刀，朝零号机的方向甩去。

Dodging it easily, Unit 00 ducked a series of vicious kicks and punches, until Unit 03 finally grabbed it by the throat with both hands and pinned it to the ground. Snarling in fury, Unit 03 continued strangling Unit 00 and Rei.  
轻松躲过，零号机避开了一连串凶狠的踢打，直到三号机最终用双手掐住它的喉咙，将其按倒在地。三号机愤怒地咆哮着，继续勒紧零号机和绫波的脖子。

Shinji with Unit 01, swung its arm around Unit 03 neck, catching it by the throat and flung it backwards, and off of Rei."  
一号线与真嗣一起，挥动手臂绕过三号机的脖子，抓住它的喉咙，猛地将其向后甩开，使它脱离了绫波。

"Thank you, Ikari-kun," gasped Rei.  
“谢谢你，碇君，”绫波喘息着说。

"Ayanami...how are we supposed to fight this thing without hurting Asuka?"  
“绫波...我们该怎么对付这东西而不伤害到明日香？”

"The commander gave us the order to defeat it in a fashion that suggested the pilot of 02's life as an afterthought."  
“指挥官下达的命令是击败它，似乎完全没考虑 02 号机驾驶员的安危。”

It took Shinji a second for him to decipher the meaning in her words, but when he did, he felt boiling blood rattle his ears, as he realized what his father had said.  
真嗣花了片刻才理解她话中的含义，但当他明白过来时，愤怒的热血冲击着他的耳膜，他意识到父亲的话意味着什么。

"Ayanami...did my father say that?"  
"绫波...我父亲真的那么说了吗？"

"Yes, he did..." "是的，他确实说了..."

Shinji's snarl was so loud that it rattled the eardrums of everybody in the commander center. Yelling at the top of his voice, he bellowed over the intercom, "WHERE THE HELL IS THAT BASTARD! DON'T YOU DARE FORFEIT ASUKA'S LIFE YOU DECEITFUL ASSHOLE!"  
真嗣的咆哮声如此之大，以至于指挥中心里的每个人都感到耳膜震动。他对着对讲机大声吼叫，"那个混蛋到底在哪儿！你敢拿明日香的生命开玩笑，你这个骗子混蛋！"

"Shinji think of it from a militaristic standpoint."  
"真嗣，从军事的角度来考虑这件事。"

"I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE MILITARY OR NERV! I WOULD RATHER DIE THEN TAKE ASUKA'S LIFE!"  
"我他妈才不在乎军队还是 NERV！我宁愿死也不愿夺走明日香的生命！"

"Ikari-kun!" "碇君！"

Shinji had just enough time to roll out of the way as Unit 03 charged at him on all fours, swiping at the armor of his Eva as it went. Skidding across the ground, Unit 03 poised on all fours again, before flinging itself through the air, and landing just where Unit 00 had been moments before.  
真嗣刚来得及滚向一旁，03 号机便四肢着地向他冲来，挥舞着爪子划过他的 EVA 装甲。03 号机在地面上滑行，再次四肢着地蓄势，随即一跃而起，正好落在 00 号机刚才所在的位置。

"Ayanami!" “绫波！”

Running at break neck speed, Shinji flung himself in front of Unit 00 as Unit 03 bore down upon her. Grasping the side of Unit 01's head, Unit 03 smashed in through somebody's abandoned house, and drug it through the dirt, before jumping up in the air to pounce on it.  
真嗣以极快的速度奔跑，挡在 00 号机前，面对着逼近的 03 号机。03 号机抓住 01 号机的头部，撞穿了一座废弃的房屋，拖着它在泥土中前行，然后一跃而起，准备扑击。

Rolling out of the way quickly, Shinji swung Unit 01's legs outward, catching Unit 03 on the way down, and knocking it off balance. As Unit 03 stumbled backwards, Shinji grabbed both of his shoulders and forcefully pinned it against the ground.  
迅速滚向一旁，真嗣挥动初号机的双腿向外侧扫去，在零三号机下落途中将其绊倒，使其失去平衡。零三号机踉跄后退之际，真嗣抓住它的双肩，用力将其按倒在地。

"Asuka, damn it answer me! You're the last person I know that would give up on this. Wake up!"  
“明日香，该死，回答我！我知道你是绝不会在这种时候放弃的。醒醒！”

Unit 03 simply opened its mouth and roared. Forcefully ripping Unit 01's hands of its shoulders, it kicked Unit 01 in the chest, knocking the breath out of Shinji in the process, and sent him skidding across the earthen ground, kicking up great chunks of dirt.  
零三号机只是张开嘴咆哮一声。它强行挣脱初号机双手的束缚，一脚踢在初号机的胸口，让真嗣瞬间喘不过气来，随即被踢得滑过地面，扬起大块泥土。

Turning to Unit 00, it flew at Rei, tearing apart the ground as it ran, and grasped Unit 00 around the throat and started strangling it savagely. Even though Rei's synchronization wasn't nearly as strong as Shinji's she was still able to feel a fraction of the pain Unit 00 felt, and her trachea was soon being constricted.  
转向零号机，它向绫波疾驰而去，撕裂着地面，一把掐住零号机的喉咙，开始野蛮地勒紧。尽管绫波的同步率远不及真嗣，但她仍能感受到零号机所受痛苦的些许，很快她的气管便被压迫。

As Shinji stood up, he had to fight the urge to vomit out of his system. Shaking himself of the dizziness, he saw Unit 03 bearing down over Unit 00 and crushing its wind pipe. Sudden anger shot through Shinji even with his best attempts to control it. Next second he was beside Unit 03, and slammed an AT-field directly into the side of his foe.  
当真嗣站起身时，他不得不强忍住呕吐的冲动。他摇晃着摆脱眩晕，看到三号机正压在零号机上，碾碎其气管。尽管他竭力控制，愤怒仍如闪电般袭来。下一秒，他已出现在三号机旁，猛地将 AT 力场砸向对手的侧身。

Unit 03 went flying backwards, kicking up dirt, toppling power lines, and making houses turn to powder.  
三号机向后飞去，扬起尘土，撞倒电线杆，房屋化为齑粉。

"Ayanami...you okay?" "绫波...你还好吗？"

"Unit 00 has suffered some contamination, but I will be fine.  
"零号机受到了一些污染，但我会没事的。"

"You sure?" "你确定吗？"

"Yes, I will be fine..."  
"是的，我会没事的..."

"...Okay." “……好吧。”

Looking back over at Unit 03, Shinji had just enough time to see it getting up, before both its arms suddenly swung at them from four hundred yards away. Shinji managed to dodge out of the way, but Rei didn't react quickly enough and Unit 03 hands wrapped around Unit 00 head, and pummeled it against the ground.  
回头望向 03 号机，真嗣刚好看到它站起身来，紧接着它的双臂突然从四百码外向他们挥来。真嗣设法躲开了，但绫波反应不够快，03 号机的手缠住了 00 号机的头部，并将其猛击在地。

"Ayanam-" “绫波——”

Unit 03 other arm swung outward, gripping Unit 01's wind wipe, constricting it, and almost instantly, Shinji felt as though he was going to pass out. Gripping both his hands around Unit 03's arm, he twisted it, forcing a break, and making Unit 03 rear backwards in anger and frustration.  
03 号机的另一只手臂向外挥出，抓住了 01 号机的风挡，紧紧勒住，几乎立刻，真嗣感到自己快要昏厥。他双手紧握住 03 号机的手臂，用力扭转，迫使其断裂，令 03 号机因愤怒和挫败而向后仰去。

Roaring angrily, the bulge in the side of its arm suddenly rightened itself with a loud snap, setting it back into place. Snarling angrily, the holsters for the progressive knifes in the shoulders suddenly exploded, showering the ground in flesh and bone, as two humanoid arms shot out of the wound.  
愤怒咆哮着，它手臂侧面的隆起突然发出一声巨响，自行复位。愤怒地咆哮着，肩部用于装载渐进式刀具的枪套突然爆炸，将血肉和骨头洒满地面，同时两条类人手臂从伤口中猛地伸出。

Grasping Unit 01's arm, Unit 03 cleanly broke it, making Shinji howler as pain coursed through his right arm.  
抓住初号机的手臂，三号机干净利落地将其折断，让真嗣因右臂传来的剧痛而嚎叫。

Moving over to Unit 00, Unit 03 grabbed the right arm and pulled with all its might, until the arm came clean off, spewing blood and gore around the ground and on its hands. Throwing the arm off to the side, it reared backwards and prepared to smash a fist into the head of Unit 00 when an AT-field flashed suddenly, severing one of its newborn hands.  
三号机移动到零号机旁，抓住其右臂全力拉扯，直到手臂完全脱落，鲜血和内脏四溅，洒满地面和它的双手。将手臂甩到一旁，它后仰准备用拳头猛击零号机的头部，此时 AT 力场突然闪现，切断了它新生的手。

Blood spewed out of what was once a shoulder and seemed to rain down upon its head, creating a fountain.  
鲜血从曾经是肩膀的地方喷涌而出，仿佛化作雨幕洒落在其头部，形成了一道血泉。

Shinji started to lose focus as Unit 03 slowly started walking towards him, regrowing its arm in the process.  
随着三号机缓缓向他走来，手臂在过程中逐渐再生，真嗣开始失去集中力。

"Shinji...what are you doing?"  
“真嗣……你在做什么？”

Shinji froze as he heard his fathers voice over the intercom.  
听到父亲的声音从对讲机传来，真嗣僵住了。

"Fa-fath-" "爸、爸爸——"

"The enemy is in front of you...destroy it."  
"敌人就在你面前……消灭它。"

"But Asuka's in there! I can't hurt her!"  
"但明日香在里面！我不能伤害她！"

"Doesn't matter. That is an angel, our enemy."  
"这无关紧要。那是使徒，我们的敌人。"

"I'd rather die then kill her."  
"我宁愿死也不愿杀她。"

"...If you are so set on dying then find death in your own way, but don't go throwing away Unit 01 which your mother put her life's work into."  
"...如果你执意要死，那就用自己的方式去死吧，但别把初号机——你母亲倾注了一生心血的初号机——白白浪费掉。"

"Fa-"

Shinji felt the density of the LCL fluid change abruptly, as everything went dark.  
真嗣感觉到 LCL 液体的密度突然改变，随后四周陷入一片黑暗。

"Father...what are you..."  
"父亲...你在做什么..."

Shinji felt something moving behind his seat and next second a robotic figure was hovering over him, locking his hands against the controls of Unit 01 with several metallic clicks. It bent down to an inhuman level so that a monitor with the words DMYSYS displayed in front of him. Then his visual screen suddenly turned a blood red color as he felt the the Eva start moving again.  
真嗣感觉到座椅后有什么东西在移动，下一秒一个机器人形象的物体悬浮在他上方，伴随着几声金属的咔嗒声，将他的双手牢牢固定在初号机的控制器上。它弯下腰到一个非人的程度，一个显示着'DMYSYS'字样的屏幕出现在他面前。随后，他的视觉屏幕突然变成了血红色，同时感觉到 EVA 再次开始移动。

"FATHER YOU-" "父亲您——"

Unit 01 charged forward towards its target, all sign of Shinji's childish emotions lost. As Unit 03 flung out its arms to attack, Unit 01 one grabbed both arms, and pulled Unit 03 towards itself, before kicking it squarely in the chest, sending it flying backwards at the speed of a jet plane.  
初号机向着目标疾冲而去，真嗣那孩子气的情感已荡然无存。当三号机伸出双臂发起攻击时，初号机一把抓住了它的双臂，将其拉向自己，然后狠狠一脚踢在胸口，以喷气式飞机般的速度将三号机击飞出去。

Crashing into a nearby hillside, Unit 03 dodged out of the way just in time as Unit 01 followed up with swift punch to where its head had been moments before. Gouging out a great mound of dirt with his punch, Unit 01 jumped high in the air, before falling down directly in front of Unit 03.  
猛地撞向附近的山坡，03 号机及时闪避，而 01 号机紧随其后，迅速出拳击向它头部刚刚所在的位置。01 号机一拳挖出一大块泥土，随即高高跃起，直落于 03 号机面前。

Unit 03 swung outwards with its stretched arms, grabbing Unit 01 left arm and attempted to pull it off as it had done to Unit 00. Unit 01 reared its head, grasping at the outstretched arm of Unit 03 and ripped a large chunk of flesh off the bone. Tossing it aside, Unit 01 followed up with quick jab to the open wound, splitting the bone instantly.  
03 号机伸出双臂向外挥舞，试图抓住 01 号机的左臂，就像之前对 00 号机所做的那样。01 号机猛地抬头，抓住 03 号机伸出的手臂，撕下一大块肉。随后，01 号机将肉块抛开，紧接着对那开放的伤口快速一击，瞬间击碎了骨头。

Unit 03 let go in pain, and retreated backwards a few steps before Unit 01 roared in front of it with its fist cocked backwards. Punching with the full power of an Eva, the shockwave that followed stripped the bark off trees, and shattered the windows of houses within a thousand yard radius.  
03 号机因疼痛松手，后退几步，而 01 号机在它面前咆哮，拳头蓄势待发。以 EVA 的全力一击，随之而来的冲击波剥离了树木的树皮，震碎了方圆千码内房屋的窗户。

Staggering backwards, Unit 03 clutched at the large dent in its chest, just as Unit 01 palmed Unit 03's head in its hand. Smashing it into the ground repeatedly, Unit 01 proceeded to start the dismemberment.  
踉跄后退，03 号机紧抓着胸前的大凹痕，与此同时，01 号机一掌按住 03 号机的头部，将其反复砸向地面，随即开始了肢解。

Finally Unit 01's mouth opened, as it tore into the lower abdominal cavity of Unit 03. Organs were removed and slithered out onto the already blood soaked ground, while bone was smashed cleanly in half as though it had been cleaved by an axe.  
最终，01 号机张开嘴，撕开了 03 号机的下腹部。内脏被扯出，滑落到早已血迹斑斑的地面上，骨头则被干净利落地砸成两截，仿佛被斧头劈开一般。

Throughout the horror fest, Shinji constantly cursed back at his father. Didn't he understand that Asuka was the first person that he had connected with? Why didn't he understand that she was someone special, someone important to him?  
在这场恐怖的折磨中，真嗣不停地咒骂着他的父亲。难道他不明白，明日香是他第一个与之建立联系的人吗？为什么他不明白她是一个特别的人，一个对他来说很重要的人？

As Unit 01 started ripping apart the flesh of Unit 03, Shinji almost gave up hope when he heard a familiar voice resounding in his head.  
当 01 号机开始撕裂 03 号机的血肉时，真嗣几乎要放弃希望，这时他听到一个熟悉的声音在他脑海中回响。

"_What the fuck is this shit? Son of a bitch trying to control me with this fucking copy."_  
“这他妈是什么鬼东西？这个混蛋想用这该死的复制品控制我。”

Shinji had never heard the 'voice' talk in such a scornful tone before.  
真嗣从未听过这个‘声音’用如此轻蔑的语气说话。

"_Bastard's trying to control me, not like it will do any good without you here anyway. I'm going to connect directly with you again. If we achieve a high enough sync rate we should be able gain control again."_  
"混蛋想控制我，没有你在这儿，他再怎么努力也没用。我要再次直接与你连接。如果我们能达到足够高的同步率，应该能重新获得控制权。"

Shinji nodded and prepared to feel the nerves pierce his skin and connect directly with his thoughts. Feeling a hot white poker hit his brain he knew that the connection had been made.  
真嗣点点头，准备感受神经刺穿皮肤，直接与他的思维相连。感觉到一股灼热的白刃刺入大脑，他知道连接已经建立。

"_Haven't done this in a while..."_  
"好久没这么做了..."

"Why is that?" “为什么？”

"_Because you learned how to control the Eva by yourself. I was simply guiding you the other times. Now quiet and think about dismantling this pile of shit."_  
"因为你已经学会了自己控制 Eva。之前我只是引导你。现在安静下来，想想怎么拆解这堆烂摊子。"

"I have something else I wanted to-"  
"我还有其他事情想做——"

"_Not now, do you want to fix this or not."_  
"现在不行，你想不想修好它？"

'Right,' thought Shinji. '没错，' 真嗣心想。

Closing his eyes, he thought of Asuka and nobody else. If she wasn't one hundred percent perfectly fine, heads would roll, and not in a figurative sense.  
他闭上眼睛，心中只想着明日香，别无他人。如果她不是百分之百完全无恙，那可就有人要倒霉了，绝非比喻。

He pictured them back in Misato's apartment. No school, no Nerv crap, just the two of them lazing around on the couch together. She'd be watching T.V. as usual, and he'd be listening to his SDAT. Eventually she'd yell at him to make dinner or go somewhere else because he was bothering her. He didn't care to have it anyway else.  
他想象着他们回到美里小姐的公寓。没有学校，没有 NERV 那些破事，只有他们俩一起懒洋洋地躺在沙发上。她会像往常一样看电视，而他则听着他的 SDAT。最终她会大喊让他去做饭或去别的地方，因为他打扰到她了。他并不介意这样的日常。

Inside the Geofront, Gendo was presiding over the task of managing the dummy plug. Ritsuko, who may have been the lead designer of it, was still unknown at the time because of the activation test with Unit 03.  
在 Geofront 内部，Gendo 正主持着管理模拟插入栓的任务。当时，作为其首席设计师的律子仍身份不明，这是因为与 03 号机进行的激活测试。

"Dummy plug is operating at full capacity with a minute and a half of remaining battery life"  
“模拟插入栓正以满负荷运行，电池剩余寿命为一分钟三十秒。”

"Hang on..." “坚持住……”

Fuyutsuko who was standing beside Gendo asked, "What?"  
站在源堂旁边的冬月问道："什么？"

"The plug depth is increasing rapidly...passing over the danger area...one hundred...one hundred and ten. Pilot seems to be willfully entering the containment zone."  
"插入深度正在迅速增加...已超过危险区域...一百...一百一十。驾驶员似乎在故意进入封锁区。"

"Cut the synchronization of the nerve receptors down to-"  
"将神经接收器的同步率降低至-"

"Hold on," said Gendo in his loud voice.  
"等等，" 源渡用他响亮的声音说道。

"But sir, any more of this and the pilot might never be human again."  
"但是先生，再这样下去，驾驶员可能永远无法恢复人性了。

"He can handle it. Continue as planned, release the limiters on the dummy plug."  
"他能应付。按计划继续，解除傀儡系统的限制器。

Back inside Unit 01, Shinji felt the blood slowly flowing from the small piercings in his skin and dissolve into the LCL fluid.  
在初号机内部，真嗣感觉到血液从皮肤上的小孔中缓缓流出，溶解在 LCL 液体中。

"_Okay...I'm going to attempt to break the control over this thing. Get ready, that thing out there is able to regenerate faster then I expected. I don't want to gain control again, only to have us lose next second."_  
“好的……我要尝试打破这东西的控制。准备好，外面那家伙的再生速度比我预想的要快。我不想再次夺回控制权，结果下一秒我们就输了。”

"Ready whenever." “随时待命。”

"_Disengaging...now..."_ "正在解除连接...现在..."

Shinji immediately felt the difference in the LCL fluid. It became much lighter, and less hostile. The blood red glow around the screens slowly faded away, letting Shinji see the landscape once again.  
真嗣立刻感受到了 LCL 液体的变化。它变得轻了许多，也不再那么敌意十足。屏幕周围血红色的光芒缓缓消退，让真嗣再次看到了外面的景象。

"_Shit..."_ "该死..."

"What?" "什么？"

"_That damn thing is trying to come back online."_  
"那该死的东西正试图重新上线。"

"Can't you do anything to stop it?"  
"你就不能做点什么阻止它吗？"

"_Yes, but not for very long."_  
"能，但坚持不了多久。"

"How long!" "多久了？"

"_A minute at most."_ "最多一分钟。"

"Do it. I've got to get Asuka out of that thing before it has a chance to regenerate."  
"动手吧。我得在它有机会再生之前把明日香救出来。"

Moving so that he was standing directly beside the broken Eva's head, he molded his thoughts to that of a shape that would perfectly fit around the entry plug Asuka was in. Now projecting it, he carefully concentrated on that single point and started crisscrossing other points until he had created something like a net. Filling in the small holes, he carefully carved away the white substance that was clinging to the entry plug, and gently lifted it out of the Eva.  
他移动到破损的 Eva 头部旁边，将自己的思维塑造成一个能完美契合插入栓的形状。现在他将其具象化，小心翼翼地集中注意力于那个点，并开始交叉连接其他点，直到编织出一张类似网的东西。填补小孔，他仔细地削去附着在插入栓上的白色物质，并轻轻将其从 Eva 中抬起。

"_You're getting pretty good at creating exactly what you want..."_  
“你越来越擅长创造你想要的东西了...”

"Thanks," mumbled Shinji as he chose a place to set the entry plug down  
“谢谢，”真嗣咕哝着，选择了一个地方放下插入栓

"_Now hurry up and destroy the rest of it."_  
"快点，把剩下的也毁掉。"

Shinji nodded and drew back Unit 01's fist, and smashed against the Evangelions skull. Brain matter exploded and shattered the ground with bits of gray tissue.  
真嗣点头，指挥初号机收回拳头，猛击在使徒的头骨上。脑浆爆裂，灰色的组织碎片四溅，将地面击碎。

"Its over," breathed Shinji.  
"结束了，" 真嗣轻声说道。

---

The aftermath of the battle took a while to mull over. Misato and Ritsuko had been found with no bodily injury. Rei was fine though a little sore, and Unit 00 would need some replacement part.  
战斗后的余波需要一段时间来消化。美里和律子被发现时身体并无大碍。绫波虽然有些酸痛，但并无大碍，而零号机则需要一些替换零件。

Asuka though...Shinji still wasn't allowed to see her since her admittance to Nerv hospital.  
至于明日香...自从她被送进 NERV 医院后，真嗣仍未被允许探望她。

He had been the first to see her, and it was something that would probably forever stick in his mind when he opened managed to get into the entry plug.  
他是第一个见到她的人，这一幕或许将永远烙印在他的记忆中，当他设法进入插入栓时。

He had forcefully ejected himself for Unit 01, and slowly climbed his way down to the base of the foot. When he had arrived at the entry plug, he realized that the handle had the glue like substance caked over it. He tried several times to break through to the handle, but he found that it was just to strong. He eventually decided to try something.  
他强行将自己从初号机中弹射出来，缓缓爬下至脚部基座。当他到达插入栓时，发现把手被一种胶状物质覆盖着。他尝试了几次想要突破到把手，却发现它实在太坚固了。最终，他决定尝试其他方法。

He had become conscious of his own AT-field, it felt like his outer skin was coated in jello. Molding it to his thought, he carefully sliced a sizable hole in the metal of the entry plug. He had expected to step into waist deep LCL fluid, but was surprised when the liquid barely came up to his knees.  
他开始意识到自己的 AT 力场，感觉就像外皮涂了一层果冻。他按照自己的想法小心翼翼地在插入栓的金属上切开了一个大洞。他本以为会踏入齐腰深的 LCL 液体，却惊讶地发现液体仅没过膝盖。

Crawling over to where Asuka was, he found her hand and squeezed it, expecting to feel her reassuring warmth that she was okay back. He did not expect to feel her hand, freezing cold, and coated in her own blood.  
他爬到明日香身边，找到她的手并紧紧握住，期待感受到她安然无恙的温暖回应。但他没想到，她的手冰冷无比，还沾满了她自己的血。

After the medics arrived he got a good look at he face and realized that her she was coated in her own blood, and yet, she didn't have a wound on herself. After that, Shinji had to be detained as he had caused a large fuss, and nearly broke several peoples necks trying to get to Asuka.  
医护人员到达后，他仔细看了她的脸，发现她满脸都是自己的血，然而，她身上却没有一处伤口。之后，真嗣因为引起了大骚动而被拘留，他差点扭断几个人的脖子，只为冲向明日香。

Right now he was back in his favorite room, that made him look like a mental patient.  
此刻他又回到了他最喜欢的房间，那让他看起来像个精神病患者。

Curling up in a ball on his unfavorable bed, he heard a brief knock on the door and Ritsuko poked her head in.  
他蜷缩在不太喜欢的床上，听到门口传来短暂的敲门声，随后律子探头进来。

"I wasn't sure if you had been asleep..."  
"我不确定你是否已经睡着了……"

"Like I could sleep after today...I don't think that I'll ever get that image out of my head."  
"经历了今天的事，我怎么可能睡得着……我想我永远也忘不了那个画面。"

"You should be just happy she's alive, though not readily well."  
"你应该庆幸她还活着，尽管状况并不太好。"

"How is she, and can I see her?"  
"她怎么样了，我能见她吗？"

"She's fine in the sense that she's breathing and alive, and no you can't see her."  
"她还好，至少还活着、在呼吸，但你不能见她。"

"Why is that," asked Shinji, slowly brimming with anger?  
"为什么？" 真嗣问道，怒气逐渐升腾。

"You won't be able to handle it, and I don't want your reaction to send her into a coma. Thats the last thing we need right now."  
"你应付不来的，我不想你的反应让她陷入昏迷。那可是我们现在最不需要的麻烦。"

"What is wrong with her? She seemed fine physically-"  
"她怎么了？她身体看起来没什么问题——"

"Thats what you were briefly able to see, and its lucky the medical team got there so fast, she was slipping."  
"那只是你短暂看到的表象，幸好医疗队来得快，她当时情况正在恶化。"

"Are you going to-" "你打算去——"

"She lost roughly half the blood in her body."  
"她失去了体内大约一半的血液。"

"What! How!" "什么！怎么会！"

"I only have a theory as to that, and its pretty farfetched."  
"我对此只有一个理论，而且相当牵强。"

"I don't care." "我不在乎。"

"Ok then...hows this. The angel that we encountered seemed to be able to contaminate other hosts. My question is, what was that limited to?"  
"那好吧……这样如何。我们遇到的那位天使似乎能够感染其他宿主。我的问题是，这种能力有何限制？"

"I'm not following you." "我没听懂你的意思。"

"During the activation test, Asuka wasn't completely there, and it was apparent. She hasn't been coping well since the-"  
"在激活测试期间，明日香明显心不在焉，她自从那件事之后就一直没能好好应对。"

"Right," said Shinji, cutting her off."  
"对，" 真嗣打断了她的话。"

"We shouldn't have used her. We should have used you like we originally thought of, or chosen somebody from your school."  
"我们不该用她的。我们原本考虑用你，或者从你们学校选一个人。"

"From my...what?" "从我的...什么？"

"Each child in your class has the possibility of being an Eva pilot. Touji was a prime candidate before Asuka was chosen."  
"你们班上的每个孩子都有可能成为 EVA 驾驶员。在选择明日香之前，冬二曾是最佳人选。"

"Why wasn't he chosen?" “为什么没有选他？”

"Something about the belief that children that have siblings don't produce good sync ratios. Anyways, Asuka didn't want to do the test, but because she was filling in for you, she was okay with it enough to accept it. That led to her mentality being damaged during the test. My guess is that she had some encounter with the angel in her mind, and willfully let it take control of her."  
“大概是认为有兄弟姐妹的孩子同步率不会太高。总之，惣流本来不想参加测试，但因为她是替你去的，所以勉强接受了。这导致她在测试中心态受损。我猜她在意识中遭遇了使徒，并故意让它控制了自己。”

"Then she was possessed by the angel? But then what about the Eva? Was it possessing both of them?"  
“那她是被使徒附身了吗？但 EVA 又怎么回事？难道两者都被附身了？”

"You know how you gain wounds and get hurt every time you enter Unit 01, because you have such a high sync rate with it."  
"你知道每次你进入 01 号机时都会受伤，因为你的同步率太高了。"

"Yeah..." "是啊..."

"What if Asuka experienced that, only opposite."  
"如果明日香经历的是相反的情况呢？"

"I don't understa-" "我不明白——"

"Asuka took the wounds for Unit 03. The angel was possessing her, not the Eva."  
“明日香替三号机承受了那些伤。是使徒在控制她，而非 Eva。”

"But how did all that blood?"  
“但那些血是怎么回事？”

"High speed regeneration most likely. Asuka would take the brunt of the damage from the attack, and the angel would be fine. After the dummy plug was used though, the angel couldn't keep up with regenerating constantly."  
“很可能是高速再生。明日香会承受攻击的主要伤害，而使徒则安然无恙。不过，在使用模拟插入栓后，使徒无法持续再生。”

"But why possess her? What was the point?"  
"但为什么要附身于她？这有什么意义呢？"

"As to that...I have no idea."  
"至于那个...我完全不知道。"

Shinji paused for a second before he said, "You said something about a dummy plug. Was that the thing that took over for me during the battle?"  
真嗣停顿了一下，然后说道：“你提到过一个模拟插入栓。那东西是在战斗中代替我的吗？”

"Yes..." "是的..."

Shinji sat there for a while on the edge of his bed, thinking about what he wanted to do. Of course he wanted to run to Asuka's side, but he had to agree with Ritsuko for once. Seeing her later would have to wait, and besides, he had somebody else he wanted to talk to.  
真嗣坐在床边，思索着自己想做的事情。当然，他想要跑到明日香身边，但这次他不得不赞同律子。见她的事只能稍后再说，而且，他还有其他人想谈谈。

Standing up abruptly, Shinji said, "I have something that I want to help me with."  
真嗣突然站起来，说道：“我有件事想请人帮忙。”

Ritsuko hesitated, unsure whether she should agree, not knowing what it could be. Figuring that it couldn't be anything harming, she said, "If its something within my power...I shall try."  
律子犹豫了一下，不确定是否应该答应，也不知道那会是什么。她想应该不会有什么害处，便说：“如果是我力所能及的事……我会尽力。”

Taking a large gulp of air, he got the words out of his mouth that he had been thinking about for a while these past few weeks. Words that he had always been too afraid to ask because of the shear fear and intimidation that pushed at him when he thought of the man.  
他深吸一口气，终于将这几周来一直萦绕在心头的话说了出来。这些话他一直不敢问，因为每当想到那个男人，巨大的恐惧和威压就会向他袭来。

"Ritsuko...I want to talk to my father..."  
“律子...我想和我父亲谈谈...”

**P.S. Merry Christmas! 附：圣诞快乐！**

### Chapter 15: Confusion

**Yawn...well, here is the new chapter. Wasn't sure how quickly I'd start working on this one, but I went to San Fran on a vacation and found myself working on it in my spare time, and I'd estimate this story has around ten more chapters till its finished, though thats still just an estimate. On another note, I got my mom to watch Episode 1 of Evangelion since I told her that if she wants to read my story, then she has to have some understanding of the terminology and how Shinji and Asuka's relationship develops. She seemed to like it also, which doesn't surprise me really since she enjoyed Elfen Lied, which is gory beyond all belief. Anyway enough jabbering out of me, I'm going to bed.  
哈欠...好吧，新章节来了。我不确定自己会多快开始写这一章，但我去旧金山度假时，在空闲时间就开始动笔了，我估计这个故事还有大约十章就完结了，不过这还只是个估计。另外，我让妈妈看了《新世纪福音战士》的第一集，因为我说如果她想读我的故事，她得对术语和真嗣与明日香的关系发展有所了解。她似乎也很喜欢，这并不让我惊讶，因为她之前也很喜欢《妖精的旋律》，那部剧血腥得超乎想象。好了，不多说了，我要去睡觉了。**

Gendo Ikari sat at his desk, facing the window directly behind him that showed the entirety of the Geofront. Though he didn't want to admit it, the pilot of Eva 01 had affected his plans with this latest bout of courage. He had never imagined that he would have managed to override the dummy plug from inside the Eva. Though what might have amazed him more was that he had managed to destroy the angel while keeping Unit 02's pilot relatively alive.  
碇源堂坐在他的办公桌前，面对着身后直接展示第三新东京市全貌的窗户。虽然他不想承认，但初号机的驾驶员在这场最新的勇气表现中影响了他的计划。他从未想过他能从内部覆盖 EVA 中的模拟插入栓。尽管更让他惊讶的是，他居然能在保持二号机驾驶员相对存活的情况下摧毁使徒。

He had seen the connection between the two long before even they had realized it themselves. And why not? They were both so similar that they were bound to connect in some way, for better or for worse. He had not expected things to turn out as they had, with there lives so entwined that they affected each other so greatly. Had he planned it? Maybe deep down in the recesses of his mind he had hoped for such a scenario, but things had escalated to a point that surpassed his wishes.  
他早在他们自己意识到之前，就已看出了两人之间的联系。这又有什么奇怪的呢？他们如此相似，注定会在某种程度上产生交集，无论是好是坏。他未曾预料到事情会发展到如此地步，他们的生活如此紧密相连，彼此影响深远。他是否曾计划这一切？或许在内心深处，他曾暗自期待过这样的局面，但事态的发展已超出了他的期望。

Admittedly, he had leaked information about the pilot of Unit 02 to her father, in which he took the assumed role of a revived father reuniting with a daughter. Things could not have gone better as the pilot of 01 consoled her and was a comforting item in which she could lean on. What did he care if a CEO in a large company was incapacitated because of his actions? Though he had not counted upon 01's pilots actions. He had gone beyond what could be considered as...normal, and with good reason, as he had angel blood flowing through his veins.  
无可否认，他向她父亲泄露了关于 02 机驾驶员的信息，扮演了一个复活父亲与女儿重逢的角色。事情进展得不能再顺利了，01 机的驾驶员安慰着她，成为她可以依靠的慰藉。一个大公司的 CEO 因他的行为而陷入困境，他又何曾在意？尽管他未曾料到 01 机驾驶员的行动会超出常理，而且有充分的理由，毕竟他体内流淌着天使之血。

Seele would never guess. While they had fruitlessly searched for the remains of something long since lost, he had carefully molded the pilot of Unit 01 since day one, since Yui had died.  
Seele 永远猜不到。在他们徒劳地寻找早已消失无踪的遗迹时，他从第一天起，自 Yui 去世后，就精心塑造了初号机的驾驶员。

At the thought of her, a shadow passed over Gendo's face for no more than an instance. He had thought that he had gotten rid of such emotions, but humans were such weak creatures. They suffered from such diseases that would be deemed substandard to the average mammal. Everything would change though at the coming of Instrumentality, and he would spearhead it all. He held all the pieces after all. Unit 01, its pilot, the Spear of Longinus, and Lilith. What could possibly stop him?  
想到她，Gendo 的脸上掠过一丝阴影，不过转瞬即逝。他本以为自己已经摆脱了这些情感，但人类就是如此脆弱的生物。他们承受着连普通哺乳动物都不屑一顾的疾病。然而，随着人类补完计划的来临，一切都将改变，而他将引领这一切。毕竟，他掌握着所有关键：初号机、其驾驶员、朗基努斯之枪，还有莉莉丝。还有什么能阻止他呢？

...Shinji could... ...真嗣或许能...

"Yes...he could," Gendo muttered.  
“是的……他能，”源度喃喃道。

He had long since referred to him as nothing more than an object, and it hurt to acknowledge him as a human being. If he had been more like her...but what's done is done.  
他早已将他视为一个物体，而非人类，这种认知令人心痛。如果他能更像她一些……但事已至此，无可挽回。

His growth was exceptional, more than that really, it was extraordinary. Even Ritsuko was surprised at how much he had changed, how much he had adapted to his abnormality. And yet, he had never been at such a point in his life where he feared a different outcome.  
他的成长异常出色，甚至可以说是非凡的。就连律子也惊讶于他的变化之大，以及他对异常情况的适应能力。然而，他从未像现在这样，对另一种可能的结果感到恐惧。

Shinji was strong, no getting by that, and he had begun to realize it, even take shape in his mind of what he was capable of. Gendo didn't like this freethinking. He was supposed to be the one in control, that was the whole point of assigning the pilot of 02 to 03 for the activation test.  
真嗣确实强大，这一点毋庸置疑，他已经开始意识到自己的能力，甚至在心中形成了自己能做什么的轮廓。源堂不喜欢这种自由思考。他本应是掌控一切的人，这就是为什么将 02 号机驾驶员分配给 03 号机进行激活测试的全部意义所在。

He had to control Shinji, and what better way then holding the pilot of 02 over his head, for Gendo knew that Shinji could never refuse a demand if her life was in danger. But still...how had it happened?  
他必须控制真嗣，而最好的方法莫过于用 02 号机驾驶员的生命来威胁他，因为源堂知道，只要她的生命受到威胁，真嗣绝不会拒绝任何要求。但即便如此...这一切又是如何发生的呢？

Why had the dummy plug not registered properly when first inserted in Unit 01 during the first attempt at combating the angel? Did Yui reject him? It didn't seem possible, but there was still a probability of it happening.  
为什么在第一次尝试对抗使徒时，插入到 01 号机中的模拟插入栓没有正确注册？是唯拒绝了他吗？这似乎不可能，但仍存在这种可能性。

So then he had had no choice but to have Shinji pilot the Eva while the dummy plug was still inserted. It seemed that the dummy plug was able to function properly as long as Shinji was inside the plug. Certainly it seemed that way. But during the fight against the angel, Shinji had arrested control away from him and forced the dummy plug to cease its function. How had he done it? It almost seemed impossible that he would have been able to accomplish it without some sort of help. Then did Yui...or something else.  
于是，他别无选择，只能让真嗣在插入栓仍处于模拟模式时驾驶 EVA。似乎只要真嗣在插入栓内，模拟模式就能正常运作。确实，看起来是这样。但在与使徒的战斗中，真嗣夺取了控制权，迫使模拟模式停止运作。他是怎么做到的？这几乎不可能，除非他得到了某种帮助。那么是 Yui...还是其他什么东西呢？

Well, he supposed that the outcome was still within management. The pilot of 02 was supposed to loose her life during this battle, but she seemed to have pulled through, at least at the moment. Whether it was Shinji's timely arrival, or her own willpower which seemed to be extraordinary in its own right...well, she would be out of commission for a while, and as long as she still survived, she still held a purpose. He supposed he'd let it stay like that, for now.  
嗯，他认为结果仍在掌控之中。02 号驾驶员本应在这次战斗中丧生，但她似乎挺了过来，至少目前如此。无论是真嗣的及时赶到，还是她自身异常强大的意志力...总之，她将暂时无法行动，但只要她还活着，就有其存在的意义。他想，暂时就这样吧。

Swiveling around to face his desk, he was about to examine the damages documented by Misato of the two Eva's when he heard a knock on the door and a voice which he loathed every time he heard it.  
他转过身来面对办公桌，正准备查看美里记录的两台 EVA 的损坏情况，这时他听到了敲门声和那个每次听到都让他厌恶的声音。

"Commander...I have the pilot of Unit 01 with me...he-"  
"指挥官...我带着 01 机体的驾驶员...他-"

"Doctor Akagi, I don't have time for such trivial things as baby sitting-"  
"赤木博士，我没时间做这种看孩子的琐事-"

"Shinji says he's ready to dismantle half the base...and take Unit 01 with him..."  
"真嗣说他准备拆掉基地的一半...并带走 01 机体..."

Gendo sat silent for a few seconds. The very idea of a child taking control of Nerv like that was utterly ridiculous, though not improbable. An important person in his life was just hospitalized on the verge death with a possibility of lasting affects. His emotions would be running high and he would act without thought. Maybe it wouldn't hurt, he supposed. He could outline a few things while he was at it.  
源渡沉默了几秒钟。一个孩子那样掌控 NERV 的想法虽然荒谬，但并非不可能。他生命中的一个重要人物刚刚因濒临死亡而被送进医院，可能会有长期影响。他的情绪必然高涨，会不经思考就行动。或许这不会有什么坏处，他想。他可以在过程中提出一些要点。

"Very well, let him in, and be sure that we are not disturbed during this time."  
“很好，让他进来，并确保我们在这段时间内不受打扰。”

"Yes Commander." “是，指挥官。”

Gendo watched as the brass handles on the double door in front of him swung forward, revealing a ashen faced Ritsuko, with Shinji, who looked like he had no problems with what he had threatened to do.  
源堂注视着面前双开门上的黄铜把手向前摆动，露出了面色苍白的律子，以及看起来对自己威胁要做的事毫无悔意的真嗣。

"Leave us Doctor Akagi." “让医生离开，赤木博士。”

Ritsuko simply nodded her head and turned and walked out of the room. It was apparent that she wished that she was anywhere else.  
律子只是点了点头，转身走出了房间。显然，她希望自己此刻能在任何别的地方。

Shinji stood unmoving directly in front of the door. His face was impassive, but a small fire could be seen in his eyes.  
真嗣一动不动地站在门前。他的脸上毫无表情，但眼中却闪烁着一丝火焰。

"Father," Shinji managed to grumble out.  
“父亲，”真嗣勉强咕哝了一声。

Gendo gave no recognition to Shinji's words. He simply gazed at him for a few seconds before he nodded towards a position directly in front of his desk.  
碇源堂对真嗣的话置若罔闻。他只是静静地注视了他几秒钟，然后向办公桌前的位置点了点头。

Taking the hint, Shinji sneered slightly, before he walked forward, and stood in place where Gendo had nodded towards.  
心领神会，真嗣微微嗤笑一声，随即向前走去，站在了源渡点头示意的位置上。

Gendo laid both his elbows on the edge of his desk, wrapped his hands together, and rested his chin on the back of his hands. His usual stance.  
源渡将双肘撑在桌边，双手交握，下巴搁在手背上，这是他一贯的姿势。

Shinji's eyes darted side to side, searching for any sign of movement that might indicate another presence, and though he didn't detect anybody, he was positive that security cameras were watching him.  
真嗣的目光左右扫视，寻找任何可能表明有其他人存在的动静，尽管他没有察觉到任何人，但他确信监控摄像头正注视着他。

Taking several small breaths, he looked at the man before him and said with as much control over his voice as he could muster, "Why did you do that?"  
"他深吸了几口气，尽力控制着自己的声音，看着眼前的男人问道：“你为什么要那么做？””

Gendo looked blankly back at Shinji for several seconds as though he didn't quite understand his question.  
碇源堂面无表情地盯着真嗣看了几秒钟，仿佛不太明白他的问题。

"Did you hear me! I sai-"  
“你听到了吗！我刚说——”

"For the betterment of human kind. It was necessary."  
"为了人类的进步。这是必要的。"

"You're telling me that it was necessary to put Asuka's life at risk!"  
"你是说，让明日香的生命处于危险之中是必要的！"

"Every pilot must shoulder the risk of danger. It is no different for you, or the pilot of Unit 02."  
"每位驾驶员都必须承担危险的风险。对你或二号机驾驶员来说，并无不同。"

"Do you have any idea what kind of state she was in!" Said Shinji, his voice growing louder with each word.  
"你知道她当时是什么状态吗！" 真嗣说道，他的声音随着每个字而变得更大。

"I do not care about such trivial matters. As long as the pilot is able to achieve a successful sync rating, then nothing else is necessary."  
"我对这些琐事不感兴趣。只要驾驶员能够达到成功的同步率，那么其他一切都不重要。"

"She's a living person damn it! She was almost raped! How can you not feel sympathy for her! How can you not care!"  
"她是个活生生的人啊，该死！她差点被强奸了！你怎么能不同情她！你怎么能不在乎！"

"Sympathy does humans no such good. It is simply another emotion that we shall do away with."  
"同情对人类并无益处。它不过是另一种我们应摒弃的情感。"

"But it is what makes us, us!"  
"但正是它定义了我们！"

"Irrelevant. I did not let you enter this office to listen to your complaints. If you continue this I shall have you lea-"  
"无关紧要。我让你进办公室不是来听你抱怨的。如果你继续这样，我就要让你离开了-"

"I'm never piloting Eva again!"  
"我再也不驾驶 Eva 了！"

Gendo seemed to do a double take at that, and his eyes finally settled on Shinji.  
听到这话，源堂似乎愣了一下，目光终于落在了真嗣身上。

"What was that?" "那是什么？"

"I said I'm not piloting Unit 01 anymore. I'm done. You disgust me."  
"我说了，我不会再驾驶 01 号机了。我已经受够了。你让我感到恶心。"

"What will you do then? Forsake everything here? Start over? You are running away again."  
"那你打算怎么办？抛弃这里的一切？重新开始？你又在逃避了。"

"I don't care. It doesn't matter. I'm done."  
"我不在乎。无所谓了。我受够了。"

"Not even for the pilot of Unit 02."  
"就连二号机的驾驶员也不在乎了吗？"

"...I didn't say that. I'm taking her with me."  
"...我没那么说。我要带她走。"

"She is property of Nerv and the Japanese Self Defense Forc-"  
"她是 NERV 和日本自卫队的财产-"

"SHE IS NOT AN OBJECT! SHE IS A HUMAN BEING, SHE HAS EMOTIONS. HOW CAN YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THAT!"  
"她不是物品！她是人，有感情。你们怎么就不明白呢！"

"She is the Second Child, Pilot of Evangelion Unit 02."  
"她是二号适格者，EVA 二号机的驾驶员。"

"SHE'S A PERSON!" "她是一个人！"

"A human, with the role to defend Earth against the invading angels. She has sworn her life to defeat them, or die at the hands of them."  
"一个肩负着保卫地球对抗入侵使徒使命的人类。她誓言要击败它们，或者在它们的攻击下牺牲。"

"THEN HER ENTIRE EXISTENCE IS FOR NOT!"  
"那她的一切岂不是白费了！"

"Is it really? Would she have been better of staying in Germany with her father?"  
"真的吗？她留在德国和父亲在一起会不会更好？"

"No of course not-" "当然不会——"

"Then what would you suggest."  
"那么你有什么建议呢。"

"I don't know...but this is just...too cruel."  
"我不知道...但这实在是...太残忍了。"

"Humans are cruel. Every day thousands die at the hands of others, and why? Its because fundamentality, humans can not understand each other."  
"人类是残忍的。每天都有成千上万的人死于他人之手，为什么？从根本上说，人类无法理解彼此。"

"But I understand her!" “但我理解她！”

"That is simply two people. Try understanding ten billion people. Tell me that is possible."  
“那只是两个人。试试理解十亿人。告诉我那可能。”

"Every human isn't ment to meet each other. There just isn't enough time."  
“并非每个地球人都注定要相遇。只是时间不够。”

"But with Instrumentality it is possible. Every human can understand each other. No hateful emotions-"  
"但借助‘道具化’，这是可能的。每个人都能理解彼此。没有仇恨的情绪——"

"But nothing else either, hate differentiates us too."  
"但也没有其他情感了，仇恨至少让我们有所区别。"

"Which also leads to wars."  
"这也导致了战争。"

"But we learn from wars!"  
"但我们能从战争中学习！"

"And then we repeat the same mistakes years later. We are flawed, and only through Instrumentality can we become perfect."  
"然后几年后我们又重蹈覆辙。我们有缺陷，只有通过工具化才能变得完美。"

"You don't understand..."  
"你不明白……"

"It is you who doesn't understand. You have secluded yourself your entire life, and suddenly you start explaining to me the workings of the human mind. I have studied us as a species for seventeen years, during which I learned that we were created flawed."  
"正是你不懂。你一生都自我封闭，突然间却开始向我解释人心的运作。我研究我们这个物种已有十七年，期间我了解到，我们是被创造出来就有缺陷的。"

"Humans can't be perfect, it isn't in our nature."  
"人类不可能完美，这不是我们的本性。"

"I will make it our nature..."  
"我会让它成为我们的本性……"

"I see there is no point in continuing this. I still stand firm though in my resignation."  
"看来继续下去已无意义。但我仍坚持我的辞职立场。"

"You will be required to submit your ID card to security, and pack your bags, you will not be allowed to enter within one hundred kilometers of Tokyo-3."  
"你需要将身份证交给安保部门，并收拾好行李，你将不被允许进入东京-3 方圆一百公里内。"

"I don't care, I stopped caring long ago."  
"我不在乎，很久以前就不在乎了。"

"Then leave, this conversation is over."  
“那就离开吧，这场对话结束了。”

Shinji ignored him and turned to leave, but suddenly stopped before his hand reached the door. Turning around he looked at Gendo and said, "I talked with mom."  
真嗣无视了他，转身准备离开，但手还未触及门时突然停住了。他转过身，看着源渡说道：“我和妈妈谈过了。”

Gendo who had been looking at the papers on his desk paused and looked up, "Is that so?"  
源渡原本正看着桌上的文件，听到这话停了下来，抬头看向真嗣，“是吗？”

"Yeah, she seemed to be doing fine."  
“是啊，她看起来状态不错。”

What seemed to be a ghost of a smile passed across Gendo's lips, "I see."  
仿佛一丝幽灵般的微笑掠过源渡的唇边，“我明白了。”

Shinji waited to see if he would say anything else, before he turned the handle of the door, and stepped back into the light.  
真嗣等待着看他是否还会说些什么，随后他转动门把手，重新踏入光明之中。

Gendo meanwhile leaned back in his chair, took off his glasses and thought, 'He still has a ways to go...'  
与此同时，源堂靠在椅背上，摘下眼镜，心想：‘他还有很长的路要走...’

---

Shinji slowly trudged along the hallways of Nerv. He had never felt so dejected in his life. He had intended to talk to his father as though they were equals, not as though there was a giant wall separating the two of them. His father had steered the question away from what Shinji wanted, that was his plan all along. Waste his time on pointless discussion while steering away from what Shinji really wanted. He hadn't had a change to talk about the dummy plugs, he briefly mentioned his mom in passing. But what he really wanted to talk about was himself, and that had never seemed more harder than what it had been in those few minutes in his office.  
真嗣缓缓地走在 NERV 的走廊上，他从未感到如此沮丧。他本打算以平等的身份与父亲交谈，而不是像有一堵巨大的墙隔在两人之间。父亲巧妙地避开了真嗣真正想谈的话题，这显然是他的计划。浪费时间在无意义的讨论上，同时避开真嗣真正关心的问题。他没能有机会谈论模拟插入栓，只是顺便提到了母亲。但他真正想谈的是自己，这在办公室的那几分钟里显得比以往任何时候都更加困难。

Who was Shinji really? A boy that had been forsaken by his father? A boy who had finally found something like a parent? A boy who had finally found a close friend, somebody important to him? A boy who had maybe found his place in the world?  
真嗣究竟是谁？一个被父亲抛弃的男孩？一个终于找到了类似父母的人的男孩？一个终于找到了亲密朋友，一个对他来说重要的人的男孩？一个也许找到了自己在世界上的位置的男孩？

...Bullshit. ...胡说八道。

He was abnormal, different, a freak, unnatural, a human guinea pig, a throw away object with no relevance. Or is that how he viewed himself? How did other people view him? Some of them might view him as those things, but others would certainly view him different. His real self, so to speak.  
他是异常的，与众不同的，一个怪胎，不自然的，人类实验小白鼠，一个无关紧要的废弃物。还是说，这就是他看待自己的方式？别人又是如何看待他的呢？有些人可能会把他看作那些东西，但其他人肯定会以不同的眼光看待他。他的真实自我，可以这么说。

And so why did he exist? Was it simply to fight the angels? Is that why he had been brought into this world? That existence was just too depressing. Every human has a reason that they were brought into this world, he just had to find his.  
那么，他为何存在？仅仅是为了对抗天使吗？这就是他被带到这个世界的原因吗？那样的存在太过悲哀。每个人来到这个世界都有其原因，他只需要找到自己的。

And so why did he pilot Evangelion when he truly hated it. Was it praise from his father? To protect the people that were dear to him? A specific someone? How could he still not know after all this time? What had he been doing all this time? His life had never amounted to much so why did he do the things he did. For recognition like Asuka? Because he was told to like Rei? No! He wanted to, but he had no definable reason for it. Maybe it was everything, and maybe it was none of them? Maybe it had something to do with his parents, or his childhood? Maybe it was-  
所以他为何要在明明厌恶的情况下驾驶 EVA 呢？是为了父亲的赞许吗？为了保护他珍视的人们？某个特定的人？经历了这么多时间，他怎么还是不明白？他这些年都在做什么？他的生活从未有过多少意义，那他为何要做这些事？是为了像明日香那样的认可吗？还是因为被要求像对绫波那样？不！他是自愿的，但他没有明确的理由。也许这一切都是原因，也许都不是？或许与他的父母或童年有关？或许——

Something smashed into his shoulders and he was knocked sideways against a wall. Wincing at the pain that hit his shoulder he glanced up just in time to see a nurse with pure panic etched on the features of her face. It looked like she was about to have a heart attack, and Shinji could only guess he was the source.  
有什么东西猛地撞上了他的肩膀，他被撞得侧身撞在墙上。他因肩膀的疼痛而皱眉，抬头时正好看到一位护士脸上刻着纯粹的恐慌。她看起来像是要心脏病发作了，而真嗣只能猜测自己就是原因。

"Oh my God, I'm so sorry...I just..."  
“哦，天哪，真对不起……我只是……”

Shinji shook his head slowly and said, "Its fine...I wasn't looking where I was going anyway. ...Why are you in such a hurry though?"  
真嗣缓缓地摇了摇头，说道：“没事的……反正我也没看路。……不过，你这么急着去哪儿？”

"I got a call from Doctor Akagi. The patient in room 301 seems to have woken up and has exhibited violent behavior."  
“我接到赤木博士的电话。301 号病房的病人似乎醒了，并且表现出暴力行为。”

The room number rang violently in Shinji's ears until he could hear it echoing around is brain.  
301 号房间的数字在真嗣耳中剧烈回响，直到他感觉这声音在脑海中回荡。

Grasping the nurses wrist none to gently he said, "Where is that room number?"  
他毫不温柔地抓住护士的手腕，问道：“那个房间号在哪里？”

"I'm sorry I can't give out-"  
“对不起，我不能透露——”

Shinji applied more pressure to his grasp until he could feel the strain of her muscles.  
真嗣加大了手上的力度，直到他能感觉到她肌肉的紧绷。

Whimpering in pain, the nurse let out a small yelp that was concealed behind a cough. "I-I-I'll show you...just...let go."  
痛苦中发出呜咽，护士在咳嗽声中掩饰了一声小小的尖叫。“我……我会展示给你看……只是……放手。”

Shinji immediately released his grasp on her wrist, and was unsurprised to see a large red mark where his hand had been moments before.  
真嗣立刻松开了她的手腕，看到他刚才握住的地方留下了一块鲜红的印记，对此他并不感到意外。

Nodding towards her, he said, "Get on with it..."  
他朝她点点头，说道：“继续吧……”

He didn't know when he'd have an opportunity like this again.  
他不知道何时还能再有这样的机会。

---

Those shrieks and yells were unmistakably Asuka's thought Shinji as he stood in front of the door. The nurse had gone in moments before during which Shinji was able to see a group of people dressed in white crowded around her table. Shinji had even caught a brief glimpse of her fiery red hair before the door closed in front of him. It was taking all his efforts to not just barge in there and tare everyones head off. Though he figured Asuka had at least bitten a few of them so he thought he should wait. They were only trying to help after all.  
那些尖叫和喊声无疑是明日香的，真嗣站在门前心想。护士刚刚进去，期间真嗣看到一群身穿白大褂的人围在她的桌旁。他甚至瞥见了她火红的头发，随后门就在他面前关上了。他竭尽全力克制自己不要冲进去，把每个人的头都扯下来。不过他想，明日香至少已经咬了他们几个人，所以他决定还是等等。毕竟，他们只是在试图帮忙。

After what seemed like hours he was finally able to enter the room.  
似乎过了几个小时，他终于得以进入房间。

He had expected wires of all sorts connected to her body, and tubes that were for certain utilities, though it seemed that there was none of those, or very few at least.  
他本以为会有各种电线连接着她的身体，以及用于特定功能的管子，但似乎这些都没有，或者至少非常少。

Asuka was sitting up in her bed with a pillow propped behind her head. She seemed to be wide awake enough to recognize him, but he could see the droop in her eyes. He knew that sleep was sometimes difficult to get here, though she was certain to have some type of drug in her body. He knew that she had to receive blood transfusions every hour or so.  
明日香正坐在床上，头靠着一个枕头。她看起来足够清醒，能够认出他，但他能看出她眼皮有些沉重。他知道在这里有时很难入睡，尽管她体内肯定有某种药物。他知道她必须每隔一小时左右接受一次输血。

Walking towards the end of her bed, he sat down next to her feet and said, "How you doing?"  
他走向床尾，坐在她的脚边，问道：“你还好吗？”

"How would you feel if you lost a fourth of the blood in your body? Well, at least there was no scaring."  
"如果你失去了体内四分之一的血液，你会感觉如何？嗯，至少没有留下疤痕。"

'At least she was able to joke about something so serious,' thought Shinji.  
'至少她能对如此严重的事情开玩笑，' 真嗣心想。

"Terrible I'd imagined," mumbled Shinji.  
"我想一定很糟糕，" 真嗣咕哝道。

"As if you needed to reply to that."  
"好像你非得回复那个似的。"

"What happened earlier? I saw that a bunch of doctors and nurses were crowded around your bed."  
"刚才发生了什么？我看到一大群医生和护士围在你的床边。"

"I had a seizure," she replied in an offhanded sort of way.  
"我癫痫发作了，"她漫不经心地回答道。"

"A...what!" "A...什么！"

"I've been having them on and off, its really not that big of a deal."  
"我时不时会有这种感觉，真的没什么大不了的。"

"Yes it is!" "不，这很重要！"

"Shinji, are you going to start freaking out, or am I going to have to call a nurse in to remove you? I don't want to deal with any stress right now."  
"真嗣，你是要开始发疯，还是我得叫个护士来把你弄走？我现在不想处理任何压力。"

"Can't you understand that I've been worried sick. You weren't conscious when I brought you out of that entry plug..."  
"你难道不明白我有多担心吗。我把你从驾驶舱里救出来时，你还没醒..."

Asuka's shoulders seemed to sink as she said, "I know...I heard about how you almost killed just to get to me."  
明日香说着，肩膀似乎沉了下去，"我知道...我听说了你为了救我差点丧命的事。"

"...I didn't know if you would live."  
"...我不知道你是否能活下来。"

"I'm fine, so you can stop threatening people."  
"我没事，所以你可以停止威胁人了。"

Shinji grinned sheepishly at her words, "You heard about that?"  
听到她的话，真嗣尴尬地笑了笑，"你听说了那件事？"

"The doctors were fretting about what would happen to the hospital facilities if you suddenly went on a rampage. Can't say I'd be very impressed if you did that for my benefit. You'd do more damage then good anyway."  
"医生们担心如果你突然暴走，医院设施会怎么样。如果你为了我这么做，我可不会觉得有多好。那样只会弊大于利。"

"Sorry it got spread around, it was more to try to scare my father."  
"抱歉这事传开了，我主要是想吓吓我爸。"

"Huh?" “啊？”

"...I talked to him, or, more of he tried to persuade me."  
"...我和他谈了，或者说，是他试图说服我。"

"About what?" "关于什么？"

"Never mind...its not important."  
"算了……不重要。"

"Hmmm," muttered Asuka. "嗯，" 明日香喃喃道。

They lapsed into silence for a while, during which Asuka grabbed a German magazine that she had been reading before Shinji had walked in. Shinji meanwhile was content with simply watching her. After several minutes of this though, Asuka threw her magazine to the side and said, "If you've got something to say, say it!"  
他们陷入了一阵沉默，期间 Asuka 拿起一本之前 Shinji 进来时她正在看的德语杂志。而 Shinji 则满足于只是静静地看着她。然而几分钟后，Asuka 把杂志扔到一边，说道：“如果你有什么要说的，就说出来！”

Shinji hesitated for a second before saying, "What would you say if I told you I was quitting being an Eva pilot."  
Shinji 犹豫了一会儿，然后说：“如果我告诉你我要退出 Eva 驾驶员的身份，你会怎么说？”

"I'd say you were an idiot and a moron but thats nothing new."  
“我会说你是傻瓜和白痴，但这也没什么新鲜的。”

"I'm serious." "我是认真的。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Because I-" "因为我不——"

Wait, why did he want to quit? Was it because of his fathers disregard of Asuka? Was it because of the usage of the dummy plug? Was he just tired of people relying on him? But then, wasn't he just running away again?  
等等，他为什么要辞职？是因为他父亲对明日香的不重视吗？还是因为使用了模拟插入栓？或者他只是厌倦了人们依赖他？但那样的话，他岂不是又在逃避吗？

"I don't know." "我不知道。"

"Well thats stupid." "那真是愚蠢。"

"But what do you think?"  
"但你怎么想？"

"Its your decesi-" "这是你的决定——"

"What would you say if I wanted you to...quit with me?"  
"如果我想让你……和我一起退出，你会怎么说？"

Asuka could have fallen out of her hospital bed if it had been a little smaller,  
如果病床再小一点，明日香可能就直接摔下去了，

"Are you serious you idiot," said Asuka while tears started rolling down her cheeks. "You what? Want me to quit piloting the Eva's with you? Are you stupid?"  
"你是认真的吗，你这个白痴，" 明日香说着，泪水开始顺着她的脸颊滚落。"你说什么？要我退出和你一起驾驶 EVA？你疯了吗？"

"Why won't you believe me!"  
"为什么你就是不相信我！"

"Where would we go?" "我们能去哪儿？"

"...I was thinking maybe back to where you used to live, you know, Germany."  
"...我在想或许回到你以前住的地方，你知道的，德国。"

"What part of we could never get involved with Nerv don't you understand? This is my life! Piloting Eva is my life and what I live for, it is part of what defines me as a person."  
"你到底不明白我们绝不能与 Nerv 扯上关系的哪一点？这是我的人生！驾驶 Eva 是我的人生，是我为之而活的东西，它是我作为人的一部分定义。"

"Don't you want to be happy?"  
"难道你不想快乐吗？"

"I am happy!" "我很高兴！"

"I don't believe you!" "我不相信你！"

"Believe what you want! What do you want though Shinji? You always do what other people do. You never do what you believe, you always follow others. If you want me to tell you to stop this, I wont. Its your decision, but I wont follow you. This is my place!"  
"随你怎么想！但你到底想要什么，真嗣？你总是做别人做的事。你从不做自己相信的事，总是跟随他人。如果你希望我叫你停止，我不会。这是你的决定，但我不会跟随你。这是我的立场！"

"Even after this! Even after getting nearly killed because you were nothing more that a throwaway object."  
"即便是在这之后！即便你差点丧命，只因为你不过是个可以随意丢弃的工具。"

Asuka seemed taken aback, and it showed on her face. "They chose me to pilot it instead of you."  
明日香显得有些吃惊，她的表情显露无遗。“他们选择了我而不是你来驾驶它。”

"Because I couldn't pilot it!"  
“因为我无法驾驶它！”

"So they value me as a pilot!"  
"原来他们看重我作为飞行员的价值！"

"You don't understand how my father thinks Asuka. He was using you. If you had died...I think my mind would have broken, I would have turned into a mindless robot."  
"你不懂我父亲是怎么想的，明日香。他在利用你。如果你死了...我想我会崩溃的，变成一个没有思想的机器人。"

"So like the first." "所以像第一个那样。"

"No not like Ayanami. Different, I would have been a human dummy plug.  
"不，不像绫波。不一样，我会是一个人类模拟插件。"

"So you say that your father attempted to have me killed so that he could control you."  
"所以你说你父亲试图杀了我，以便他能控制你。"

"Yes!" "是的！"

"Bullshit! I can't believe that."  
"胡说八道！我无法相信。"

"Why can't you believe that you're the first person that I...connected with."  
"为什么你不能相信我是第一个与你...产生共鸣的人。"

"What is that supposed to mean?"  
“那是什么意思？”

"You've said it yourself before Asuka, we are alike. As much as you want to ignore that, the fact is that we both had traumatic childhoods, both our mothers are dead, we've never had or considered the need for friends, and-"  
"你自己也说过，明日香，我们很相似。尽管你想要忽视这一点，但事实是我们都有过创伤的童年，我们的母亲都去世了，我们从未有过或考虑过需要朋友，而且-"

"All right I get it already. But don't expect the same from me, I am my own person.  
"好了，我明白了。但别指望我会和你一样，我是独立的个体。"

"...Why can't you understand-"  
"...为什么你就是不明白-"

"If you thought that you were going to persuade me to leave, you're wrong. I don't care whether you stay or not!"  
"如果你以为你能说服我离开，那你就错了。我不在乎你留不留下！"

Shinji was silent for a few seconds as he continued to gaze back at Asuka. Finally, he slowly slid off the edge of the bed and made his way to the door. Turning around, he glanced briefly over his shoulder at Asuka who had picked up her discarded magazine. Even if they didn't see eye to eye, he still felt that there would always be understanding between them.  
真嗣沉默了几秒，继续凝视着明日香。最终，他缓缓从床边滑下，走向门口。转身时，他短暂地瞥了一眼明日香，她已经捡起了丢在一旁的杂志。尽管他们意见不合，他仍觉得他们之间总会有理解存在。

Giving her a brief smile, he slid the door open, and walked out into the open corridor.  
他向她微微一笑，然后拉开门，走到了开阔的走廊上。

Time seemed to freeze inside the room as soon as Shinji left, and Asuka had not moved an inch since she had picked up her magazine. In truth, she had been rereading the same sentence over and over ever since Shinji had gotten off the edge of her bed, and when he had reached the door, her eyes were straining to look over the magazine while trying to appear that she was still reading.  
真嗣一离开房间，时间仿佛就凝固了，明日香自从拿起杂志后就没有动过一下。实际上，自从真嗣离开她床边的那一刻起，她就在一遍又一遍地重读同一句话，而当他走到门口时，她的眼睛努力透过杂志边缘偷看，同时还要装作仍在阅读的样子。

After several minutes, she slowly let her hands holding the magazine fall to her lap, where the magazine slid off the sleek sheets and fell to the floor. Slowly, she lifted her right hand until her cheek was resting in it.  
几分钟后，她慢慢松开拿着杂志的手，任由它滑落到光滑的床单上，最终掉在地上。她缓缓抬起右手，直到脸颊靠在手掌上。

"Huh?" “啊？”

She drew her hand away from her cheek, surprised that it felt wet. Was she bleeding?  
她从脸颊上抽回手，惊讶地发现手上湿漉漉的。她在流血吗？

"Why am I crying?" “我为什么在哭？”

Sparkling tears glistened on her cheek as they slowly slid down, and rested on her chin. Why would she be crying? She had no reason to.  
晶莹的泪珠在她脸颊上闪烁，缓缓滑落，停留在下巴上。她为何会哭泣？她并没有理由这么做。

"Ah...I see," she mumbled.  
“啊……我明白了，”她喃喃道。

No matter what she said or did, her feelings would always betray her. Why had she said those things to Shinji? She had certainly hurt him. She hadn't meant to, she just couldn't admit that he was right, because then she would have to realize that she was wrong.  
无论她说什么或做什么，她的感情总会出卖她。她为什么要对真嗣说那些话？她确实伤害了他。她并非有意，只是无法承认他是对的，因为那样她就得意识到自己是错的。

She couldn't forsake Eva, no matter hard she tried, or no matter how much she relied on Shinji. It was part of who she was, her body was molded to fit inside her Eva. And yet, she was jealous of Shinji, so much that it hurt to think about him. She both loathed and loved the sight of him. He gave her hope when she couldn't find any, yet she hated him, because he was what she could not be.  
她无法放弃 Eva，无论她多么努力尝试，无论她多么依赖真嗣。这是她的一部分，她的身体已适应了驾驶 Eva。然而，她嫉妒真嗣，嫉妒到一想起来就心痛。她既憎恨又爱慕他的身影。他在她找不到希望时给予了她希望，但她又恨他，因为他代表了那个她无法成为的自己。

Why couldn't she just be honest with him? Was she simply just too prideful? She had wanted to yell at him to take her away from this miserable life, to rid her of the torment of piloting Eva. Her sanctuary had been defiled by the angel, but her mind and her body acted differently. She had been trained so vigorously at the German branch of Nerv that it had become something of a reflex, like a habit. How was she supposed to break something like that?  
为什么她不能对他坦诚相待？是她太过骄傲了吗？她本想对他大喊，带她离开这悲惨的生活，摆脱驾驶 Eva 的折磨。她的避难所被天使亵渎了，但她的思想和身体却做出了不同的反应。她在德国 Nerv 分部接受了如此严格的训练，以至于这成了一种本能，就像一种习惯。她该如何打破这样的束缚呢？

She didn't want Shinji to have to suffer like she had, so she had shunned him. But he was so stupid that he was sure to return...right?  
她不想让真嗣像她一样受苦，所以她疏远了他。但他那么傻，肯定会回来的...对吧？

Maybe not... 也许不会...

What Shinji had said about them being alike, Asuka could never refute that. But because they were able to understand each other, that means that they were able to hurt each other more deeply then the average human relationship. But who was Shinji to Asuka anyway?  
关于他们相似的说法，明日香无法反驳真嗣的话。但正因为能够相互理解，这意味着他们能比普通的人际关系更深地伤害对方。但真嗣对明日香来说究竟算什么呢？

"I don't know," she mumbled as her hands ran over her tear streaked face. "I didn't want this to happen..."  
“我不知道，”她喃喃自语，双手抚过泪痕斑斑的脸庞。“我本不希望事情变成这样……”

---

Shinji was unsure what to do. Should he really leave? Was his father right? Was he simply just running away? But who would care if he did? Asuka had...reacted differently to what Shinji had thought she would have done. He had at least thought she would have told him that she thought that him leaving was completely stupid and that he had to stay and cook for her. He had never expected her to leave with him, but to blatantly tell him that she didn't care whether he stayed or not, that it was completely his decision and that he shouldn't act on what other people say and do. Why couldn't she admit that they needed each other? Was it so hard to admit that fact?  
真嗣不确定该怎么做。他真的应该离开吗？他的父亲是对的吗？他只是在逃避吗？但谁会在乎他是否离开呢？明日香……对真嗣所想的事情反应出乎意料。他至少以为她会告诉他，认为他离开是完全愚蠢的，他必须留下来为她做饭。他从未料到她会和他一起离开，但直截了当地告诉他，她不在乎他是留下还是离开，这完全是他自己的决定，他不应该受别人言行影响。为什么她不能承认他们需要彼此？承认这个事实有那么难吗？

Maybe it was for her.  
或许这是为了她。

Shinji had to remind himself what she had been physically bred to do, and that was pilot Eva. He had never needed training, it had simply come naturally, which he figured had something to do with his exhibition of angel powers. She had certainly gone through rigorous training in Germany, so much that she despised the place. He could understand why she was so adamant on not returning. He couldn't blame her.  
真嗣不得不提醒自己，她被培育出来的身体是为了什么，那就是驾驶 EVA。他从未接受过训练，一切似乎自然而然就掌握了，他猜这可能与他展现出的使徒能力有关。她在德国经历了极其严苛的训练，以至于她憎恨那个地方。他完全理解她为何如此坚决不愿回去。他无法责怪她。

The fact was that she had nowhere else to go in the world, she had been trained for nothing else. What if the angel were finally defeated, what then? Were the Evangelion's and there pilots necessary in a peaceful world devoid of angels? What kind of job would she have in that scenario? Shinji honestly didn't want to think about that, because it felt too cruel.  
事实是，她在世界上无处可去，除了驾驶 EVA，她没有接受过其他训练。如果使徒最终被击败，那又如何？在没有了使徒的和平世界里，EVA 及其驾驶员还有必要存在吗？在那种情况下，她能找到什么样的工作？真嗣真心不想去思考这些，因为这感觉太过残酷。

Why couldn't she completely trust him, no matter what the problem was? She didn't have to fend for herself. They had shared enough that it was simply common sense.  
为什么无论遇到什么问题，她都不能完全信任他呢？她不必独自支撑。他们已经共同经历了那么多，这不过是常识罢了。

Was the shelter and power of the Evangelion the only thing that kept her from collapsing? But after this last battle, how did she feel? She was already in a terrible state because of the attempted rape, and then she had to go and test an Evangelion that she was wholly unfamiliar with. How was one supposed to feel about that?  
是 EVA 的庇护和力量让她免于崩溃吗？但在这场最后的战斗之后，她感觉如何？她已经因为那次未遂的强奸而处于糟糕的状态，然后又不得不去测试一个她完全不熟悉的 EVA。对此，一个人应该有什么样的感受呢？

But what was he supposed to do? Was she being honest when she had said that she didn't care wether he stayed or not? Or was that simply just her pride getting in the way again?  
但他该怎么办呢？她说她不在乎他是否留下时，是真心的吗？还是那只是她的骄傲再次作祟？

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

Shinji froze in mid step and looked around. He had not realized how much he had wandered away from the hospital ward and was surprised to noticed that he was in a completely unfamiliar part of Nerv that he had never entered before.  
真嗣在迈步中僵住了，环顾四周。他没意识到自己已经走得离医院病房那么远，惊讶地发现他来到了一个完全陌生的 NERV 区域，这个地方他以前从未进入过。

Looking around for the voice that called his name, he saw somebody peering out of a glass window to his right. It looked like...  
他四处寻找那个呼唤他名字的声音，看到有人从他右边的一扇玻璃窗向外窥视。看起来像是……

"Kaji...right," Shinji muttered?  
“加持先生……对吧，”真嗣喃喃自语？

What came back was slightly muffled as they were talking through a piece of glass. "Yeah, and I'm surprised to see you over in the investigation department. Hardly anybody every comes here, you least of all."  
透过玻璃传来的声音略显沉闷。“是啊，我也很惊讶会在调查部门见到你。这里几乎没人来，更别提你了。”

"...I was sorta thinking and lost track of time."  
“...我刚才在思考，不知不觉就忘了时间。”

Kaji frowned at him for a moment before he stood and walked over to the door. Opening it he said, "Come on in. You seem to not have anything better to do."  
加治皱眉看了他一会儿，然后起身走向门口。打开门后说道：“进来吧。看来你也没什么更好的事情做。”

Shinji's shoulders slumped slightly as he muttered an almost inaudible, "K'ay."  
真嗣的肩膀微微下垂，低声咕哝了一句几乎听不见的，"好的。"

As Shinji walked into Kaji's office the first thing he understood was that him and Misato had similar habits, in that both seemed to be extremely unorganized. Papers were strewn across a small desk that housed a computer who's keyboard was hidden under a stack of papers. A bulletin board next to the desk on the right showed a detailed map of the world. Shinji noted that it showed the world as it was before Second Impact.  
当真嗣走进加持的办公室时，他首先意识到的是，他和美里有着相似的习惯，那就是两人似乎都非常不整洁。文件散落在一台电脑的小桌子上，键盘被一堆文件掩盖。桌子右侧的布告板上贴着一张世界地图，详细展示了第二次冲击前的世界。真嗣注意到，这张地图显示的是第二次冲击前的世界。

Kaji seemed to notice that Shinji took some interest in the map and said, "Its difficult to find pre Second Impact maps anymore. Almost all of them have been thrown out or redrawn."  
加持似乎注意到真嗣对这张地图有些兴趣，说道："现在很难找到第二次冲击前的地图了。几乎所有的都被扔掉或重绘了。"

"Is that what Antarctica used to look like before Second Impact?"  
"那就是第二次冲击前的南极样子吗？"

"Yeah, it used to be a solid piece of ice, now most of the ice has evaporated though. Do you know much about Second Impact?"  
"是的，以前它是一整块冰，但现在大部分冰都蒸发了。你对第二次冲击了解得多吗？"

"...Just what the teacher taught us at school, which I learned later was wrong."  
"...只是学校老师教的那点东西，后来才知道是错的。"

"Well its not something that the public is supposed to know after all."  
"好吧，毕竟这不是公众应该知道的事情。"

"...So what happened?" "……那么，发生了什么？"

Kaji paused for a minute, before he sat down in the chair in front of his desk and crossed his arms. "Do you know much about Misato's childhood?"  
加持停顿了一下，然后坐在办公桌前的椅子上，交叉双臂。“你对美里小时候了解多少？”

Shinji shook his head. "No, she never talks about herself."  
真嗣摇了摇头。“不，她从不谈论自己。”

"...She never did." “……她从未提起过。”

"What does Misato have to do with Second Impact?"  
“美里和第二次冲击有什么关系？”

"Do you know about the South Pole Expedition team?"  
"你知道南极考察队吗？"

"...No, what is it?" "……不知道，那是什么？"

"A team of scientists that initiated Second Impact. Misato's father was in charge of the expedition."  
"一支科学家团队，引发了第二次冲击。美里她父亲就是那次考察队的负责人。"

"What! They initiated-" "什么！他们启动了-"

"You know about Adam, correct?"  
"你知道亚当的事，对吧？"

"The First Angel, yeah." "第一使徒，是的。"

"Adam appeared in the South Pole during the expedition team. A contact experiment using Adam as the host ensued during which they lost control of the experiment. That is what is known as Second Impact. Misato was only a little kid during this and she witnessed it. She's the only survivor of the team sent down there. Her father died before her eyes, he put her in a capsule and ejected it out to sea. That white cross she wears around her neck all the time, is a memento from her father. The reason she joined Nerv was because she felt that as her fathers daughter, it was her duty to continue on in his legacy, and so she fights the angels in the best way she can. ...As you said, she never likes to talk about herself, though she has a good reason. In fact you seem to be the only person that she's warmed up to in recent years."  
"亚当在南极考察队期间现身。他们以亚当为宿主进行了一次接触实验，结果实验失控，这就是所谓的第二次冲击。那时美里还只是个孩子，她亲眼目睹了这一切。她是被派往那里的团队中唯一的幸存者。她的父亲在她眼前牺牲，将她放入胶囊并弹射入海。她一直戴在脖子上的白色十字架，是她父亲的遗物。她加入 NERV 的原因是，作为父亲的女儿，她觉得自己有责任继承他的遗志，因此她尽其所能地与使徒战斗。...正如你所说，她不喜欢谈论自己，但她有充分的理由。事实上，你似乎是近年来唯一一个让她敞开心扉的人。"

"...What about you and Ritsuko though?"  
"...那你和律子呢？"

"The two of us fell out a long time ago, as for Ritsuko, well, its a professional relationship now days. Enough about us adults though, how do you feel?"  
"我们俩很久以前就闹翻了，至于律子，现在只是职业关系。不过，别再谈我们这些成年人了，你感觉如何？"

Shinji paused for a minute before he said, "What do you mean?"  
真嗣顿了一下，然后问道：“你这是什么意思？”

"You have been under house arrest for over a week now, and Asuka has now been bed ridden, what do you plan to do?"  
“你已经被软禁一个多星期了，而明日香现在卧床不起，你打算怎么办？”

"What do I plan-" “我打算——”

"I heard that you attempted to talk with the commander, and I used attempted because I heard that nothing good came out of it. And so do you really plan on leaving Nerv?"  
"我听说你试图与指挥官交谈，我用‘试图’是因为听说结果并不理想。那么，你真的打算离开 NERV 吗？"

"I don't know." "我不知道。"

"Did you consider how Misato would feel? She would certainly be hurt because of your decision."  
"你考虑过美里会怎么想吗？她肯定会因为你的决定而感到受伤。"

"I talked with Asuka..." "我和明日香谈过了..."

"And what did she say?"  
"她怎么说？"

"...She...didn't care." "...她...不在乎。"

"So what will you do?"  
“那你打算怎么做？”

"...I don't know..." “……我不知道……”

Kaji paused for a moment before he leaned back in his chair. "You know Shinji...you are a lot like myself when I was a kid. I was indecisive, I followed what others did, I didn't think for myself. I couldn't think without somebody else telling me what to do, and just like you, I tried to run away from my responsibilities. Shinji, you may not have realized it, but you have been thrust into the position of adult hood far sooner then most humans, and not just you, Asuka too. You have responsibilities that would make most adults shake in their shoes. You have aged too quickly, and us adults of the old generation must blame ourselves for that. You have become a man Shinji, and so you must make decisions like a man should."  
加治顿了顿，然后靠回椅背上。“你知道吗，真嗣……你小时候和我挺像的。我优柔寡断，总是跟着别人做，不会为自己考虑。没有别人告诉我该怎么做，我就无法思考，就像你一样，我也试图逃避责任。真嗣，你可能没意识到，但你被推到了一个比大多数人更早成年的位置，不只是你，明日香也是。你们的责任重到会让大多数成年人胆战心惊。你们成长得太快了，我们这些老一代的成年人必须为此自责。你已经成为一个男人了，真嗣，所以你必须像一个男人那样做决定。”

"I'm still a kid." "我还是个孩子。"

"Physically yes, but as I said, you have done things that no adult could ever do. You have a burden that no adult could ever carry."  
"从生理上讲是的，但正如我所说，你做了许多成年人无法做到的事情。你承担了一个成年人无法承受的重担。"

"...Are you referring to my-"  
"...你指的是我的——"

"No, nor do I care about what changes you undergo. I still see the same Shinji that I met in Misato's apartment."  
"不，我不在乎你经历了什么变化。我依然看到的是在美里公寓里遇到的那个真嗣。"

"But I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I feel like I'm nothing more than a pawn that gets moved around whenever it suits a person's needs. Why do I pilot Eva?"  
"但我不知道我该做什么。我感觉自己不过是一个棋子，每当有人需要时就随意摆布。我为什么要驾驶 EVA？"

Kaji paused for a second before he sighed and shook his head. "I can't answer that Shinji, only you can."  
加持顿了一下，然后叹了口气，摇摇头。"我无法回答你，真嗣，只有你自己能找到答案。"

Shinji suddenly found himself intensely interested in a spot on the wall where the paint seamed to be chipped.  
真嗣突然发现自己对墙上一处油漆剥落的地方产生了浓厚的兴趣。

"If you want my advice though," said Kaji after a few seconds, "I wouldn't leave, it would be irresponsible at this point. A man should finish what he started."  
“不过，如果你想听我的建议，”几秒钟后，加持说道，“我不会离开，在这个节骨眼上离开是不负责任的。一个男人应该完成他开始的事情。”

"But I didn't start this, you grownups did."  
“但我并没有开始这一切，是你们这些成年人开始的。”

"For which we shall never be forgiven, most likely. In our folly, we attempted to usurp the power of God and claim it as our own using science. Now we have to deal with the world as it is. Don't make the same mistake that past generations have made Shinji."  
"我们很可能永远无法被宽恕。在我们的愚昧中，我们试图用科学篡夺上帝的力量，将其据为己有。现在我们必须面对现实的世界。不要重蹈前人的覆辙，真嗣。"

Shinji wasn't sure whether Kaji was with or against him. His advice didn't seem all that helpful to him.  
真嗣不确定加持是支持他还是反对他。他的建议对他来说似乎并不那么有用。

"And with regards to Asuka," said Kaji continuing, "give her some time. In certain aspects, she bears a strong resemblance to a young woman that I used to know a long time ago."  
"至于明日香，"加持继续说道，"给她一些时间。在某些方面，她与我很久以前认识的一位年轻女子非常相似。"

"...I assume you mean Misato."  
"...我想你指的是美里吧。"

"I didn't say that," muttered Kaji.  
"我没那么说，" 加持低声嘟囔道。

Shinji couldn't help it, he chuckled lightly.  
真嗣忍不住轻声笑了出来。

---

"I'm surprised to see that you're not in there with her, considering you've already disobeyed orders and frightened a nurse half to death," said Misato as she walked down the hallway, stopping when she saw Shinji sitting on a chair opposite the door he was starring at.  
"我真惊讶你没在里面陪她，考虑到你已经违抗了命令还差点把护士吓得半死，"美里一边沿着走廊走，一边说道，直到她看到真嗣坐在一扇门对面的椅子上盯着门看。

Turning towards her, Shinji shrugged and said, "Being near is fine for now."  
真嗣转向她，耸了耸肩说："现在待在附近就好。"

"Did you two have another fight?" Asked Misato as she sat down next to him.  
“你们俩又吵架了吗？”美里坐到他旁边问道。

"...No, not like our normals fights, I told her that I planned on quitting Nerv and I asked her to follow me."  
"...不，不是我们平常的打斗，我告诉她我打算离开 Nerv，并邀请她跟我一起走。"

"And she of course refused you."  
"她当然拒绝了你。"

"How did you-" "你怎么知道的-"

"I've known Asuka far longer than you have Shinji, since she was first chosen as the Second Child, and the training that she underwent to accomplish that. She would be throwing five years of her life away if she followed you."  
"我认识明日香比你久得多，从她被选为第二适格者开始，以及她为了达到那个目标所经历的训练。如果她跟你走，那她就是在浪费五年的生命。"

"I suppose." "我想也是。"

"...So? Do you still plan on leaving?"  
"...所以呢？你还是打算离开吗？"

"I still don't know. What is the meaning behind my life if all I'm good for is piloting Eva?"  
"我还是不明白。如果我唯一擅长的就是驾驶 Eva，那我的人生意义何在？"

"Everybody is grateful for what you do Shinji, even the commander."  
"大家都感激你所做的一切，真嗣，即使是指挥官。"

"My father? He doesn't give a damn..."  
"我父亲？他根本不在乎..."

"He just has difficulty showing his emotions."  
"他只是不擅长表达情感。"

"...If he even has any," muttered Shinji.  
"……如果他真有的话，" 真嗣低声嘀咕道。"

The two passed into silence until Shinji blurted something out without meaning.  
两人陷入沉默，直到真嗣无意中脱口而出。

"Misato, what kind of man was your father?"  
"美里，你父亲是个什么样的人？"

The question seemed to catch Misato off guard for a minute because she turned towards him and asked him with a raised eyebrow, "What made you ask that?"  
这个问题似乎让美里措手不及，她转向他，扬起眉毛问道：“你为什么突然问这个？”

"I don't know...my conversation with my father I guess. Its the first I've had since I left home years ago. I had asked Asuka about her family before...but I feel like the answer I got wasn't what I was looking for."  
"我不知道...可能是我和父亲的对话吧。这是我多年来离开家后的第一次。我之前也问过明日香关于她家庭的事...但我觉得我得到的答案并不是我想要的。"

Misato continued looking at him for a minute before she sank back in to her chair. Crossing her legs, she said, "My father...was like yours in some ways. He was always so absorbed in his research that he never had time for me or my mother. I supposed thats why she divorced him eventually."  
美里继续盯着他看了一会儿，然后才坐回椅子上。她交叉双腿，说道：“我父亲……在某些方面和你父亲很像。他总是沉浸在他的研究中，从没有时间陪我和我母亲。我想这就是为什么她最终和他离婚了。”

"Your parents are divorced?"  
“你父母离婚了？”

Misato smiled wanly and said, "I supposed they are, though my father is no longer living."  
美里苦笑了一下，说：“我想他们是离婚了，尽管我父亲已经不在人世了。”

"I'm sorry." "我很抱歉。"

"Its okay, he died doing what he enjoyed."  
"没关系，他是在做自己喜欢的事情时去世的。"

"Did you hate him?" "你恨他吗？"

A long pause ensued, during which Shinji thought that Misato might not have heard his question and was about to open his mouth when she replied, "Yes, I suppose I did. I hated him for the same reasons that you hate your father. I felt that he had abandoned myself and my mother for his research. Though he loved me nonetheless and I found that out during the last few moments of his life. I hate myself for not realizing it sooner. And so I repent, by doing the only thing I see that I can do, by fighting the-"  
一阵漫长的沉默之后，真嗣以为美里可能没听到他的问题，正要开口时，她回答道：“是的，我想我是这样。我恨他的原因和你恨你父亲的原因一样。我觉得他为了研究抛弃了我和我母亲。尽管他依然爱我，我在他生命的最后时刻发现了这一点。我恨自己没有早点意识到。所以我通过做我认为唯一能做的事来忏悔，那就是对抗——”

"Sorry Misato...Kaji already told me some of this."  
“对不起，美里……加持已经告诉我一些了。”

"Wha-" "什-"

"He told me about Second Impact and the South Pole Expedition team."  
“他告诉我关于第二次冲击和南极考察队的事。”

Misato narrowed her eyes and said, "That stupid self conceited bastar-"  
美里眯起眼睛，说道：“那个自以为是的蠢货——”

"Sorry, and I sorta asked, so its my fault as much as his."  
“抱歉，我也有点问了，所以我的错不比他少。”

Misato grimaced and said, "How much did he tell you?"  
美里面露难色，问道：“他跟你说了多少？”

"About the true nature of Second Impact, which also led into your childhood."  
"关于第二次冲击的真正本质，这也牵涉到了你的童年。"

Misato seemed to be relieved about something, because she wiped the sleeve of her shirt across her brow. "I'll have to have a word with that idiot later. So you know that my dad helped start Second Impact."  
美里似乎因为某事松了口气，她用衬衫袖子擦了擦额头。“我晚点得跟那个笨蛋谈谈。所以你知道我父亲参与了第二次冲击的启动。”

"I wouldn't say it like that-"  
"我不会那样说的——"

"The commander was also part of the research team, but he had left a few days early on urgent business. He'd probably be dead if not for that."  
"指挥官也是研究团队的一员，但他因紧急事务提前几天离开了。如果不是那样，他可能已经遇难了。"

"My dad was on the research team?"  
"我爸爸在研究团队里？"

"Yeah, your mother also."  
"是的，你妈妈也是。"

"...I didn't know." "...我不知道。"

"It isn't in the history books. Officially a meteorite struck earth and created Second Impact, but most governments around the world know the true story."  
"历史书上没有记载。官方说法是陨石撞击地球引发了第二次冲击，但世界上大多数政府都知道真相。"

"Why bother hiding it?" "为什么要隐瞒呢？"

"To control the public. If people were to know, mass panic would ensue. Humanity cannot recognize another intelligent being on the planet other than itself."  
“控制公众。如果人们知道真相，将会引发大规模恐慌。人类无法接受地球上存在其他智慧生命。”

"And so you created the Evangelion and chose kids to pilot it."  
“于是你们创造了 EVA，并选择了孩子们来驾驶它。”

Misato hesitated for a second but instead said, "Yes, in essence."  
“Misato 犹豫了一瞬，但还是回答说：“是的，本质上如此。”

"Then its your people's fault that Asuka can't let got of the Evangelion."  
"那是因为你们的人让明日香无法放下《福音战士》。"

"She chose what she would become-"  
"她选择了自己将成为的样子——"

"Because there was no other option available for her!"  
"因为对她来说没有其他选择！"

"Shinji, if you are quitting Nerv in protest of what the commander did, you wont get much sympathy. It was the only other option since the Fourth Child has yet to be found. Rei is only compatible with Unit 00, and you could not pilot."  
"真嗣，如果你因为指挥官的行为而退出 NERV，不会得到太多同情。这是唯一的选择，因为第四适格者尚未找到。零只能与 00 号机兼容，而你无法驾驶。"

"My father made the decision to hurt me and control me!"  
"我父亲决定伤害我并控制我！"

"I don't like it either, but what do you expect me to do about it!"  
"我也不喜欢这样，但你希望我怎么办呢！"

"You're a grownup, you're supposed to be mine and Asuka's guardian, so why don't you take responsibility instead of always shoving it on me!"  
"你是个成年人，应该是我和明日香的保护者，为什么总是把责任推给我，而不是自己承担起来！"

This stung Misato greatly, and she seemed to now be leaning away from Shinji.  
这话深深刺痛了美里，她似乎开始远离真嗣。

"Shinji...Asuka decided this by herself. She knew the possible danger, but she decided to-"  
"真嗣...这是明日香自己的决定。她清楚可能的危险，但她还是决定要..."

"Yet you didn't stop her, as a proper parent would have," Shinji retorted angrily.  
"然而，作为一个称职的父母，你本应阻止她，" 真嗣愤怒地反驳道。

This stung Misato even more, and she finally stood up and turned away from Shinji.  
这话让美里更加难受，她终于站起身来，转身背对真嗣。

"Remember Shinji, if you leave, it will do more harm then good."  
"记住，真嗣，如果你离开，那只会造成更多的伤害而非好处。"

"Thats not for you to decide," he mumbled.  
“这不是你该决定的，”他咕哝道。

Misato sighed and said, "You've had to grow up too quickly, and yet you haven't matured."  
美里叹了口气说：“你不得不太快长大，然而你并未成熟。”

Shinji then turned angrily toward her, only to see that she had started walking away.  
真嗣随即愤怒地转向她，却发现她已经开始走开了。

"Remember Shinji," she called as she continued walking, "Asuka won't be the only one sad if you leave." Turning around, Shinji could see that the corners of her eyes were glistening with tears.  
"记住，真嗣，" 她边走边喊，"如果你离开，不只是明日香会难过。" 转过身，真嗣看到她眼角闪烁着泪光。

"I'd be sad too," she mumbled, before walking deeper into the depths of Nerv.  
"我也会难过的，" 她低声嘟囔，然后继续走向 NERV 的深处。

Shinji continued starring down the empty corridor where Misato had disappeared into for a long time before he turned his head to continue starring at the door that Asuka was behind. He didn't want to talk with her, not now, not after his discussion with Misato.  
真嗣继续盯着米萨托消失的空荡走廊许久，才转过头继续盯着明日香所在的那扇门。他不想和她说话，不是现在，不是在和米萨托谈过之后。

Had he gone too far? Yes, he probably had. Misato had looked after him for the longest time now. She had been the closest thing to a parent that he had experienced, and he had just accused her of being a terrible parent. But she wasn't, she didn't have a clue about who a parent really was. Is that what he was trying to find? Was he trying to find the ideal family?  
他是否走得太远了？是的，他可能确实如此。美里已经照顾他很长时间了。她一直是最接近他父母的人，而他刚刚却指责她是个糟糕的父母。但她并非如此，她对真正的父母是什么样子一无所知。这就是他在寻找的吗？他在寻找理想的家人吗？

"No, that wasn't it," he mumbled.  
“不，不是那样的，”他喃喃自语。

Then was he trying to find the love that his life had always been lacking. Had he tried to supplement Misato as a mother?  
那么，他是在寻找生活中一直缺乏的爱吗？他是否试图将美里作为母亲来弥补？

"...Damn it!" "...该死！"

Shinji kicked the chair that Misato had been sitting on to the side suddenly, his anger getting the better of him. Passing a hand over his eyes, he rubbed them, trying to get a hold of his emotions. What he really needed was to leave this place, but his security card had been taken from him so he couldn't do just that. He could force the gate open if he wanted, but he felt that was a bit excessive. So then how was he supposed...  
真嗣突然一脚将美里坐过的椅子踢到一旁，怒火中烧。他用手揉了揉眼睛，试图平复情绪。他真正需要的是离开这个地方，但他的安全卡已被没收，无法随意离开。如果他想，可以强行打开大门，但他觉得那样太过火了。那么，他该如何是好...

"...Asuka..." "...明日香..."

If he had her card he should be able to get through, the security cameras would set off an alarm though as soon as they saw him leaving. He was willing to take that chance though.  
如果他有她的卡，应该能通过，但安全摄像头一旦捕捉到他离开就会触发警报。不过，他愿意冒这个险。

Standing up, he walked to her door and pressed his ear lightly against the cold wood. He didn't hear anything and hoped that she wasn't sleeping. It wouldn't feel right to take it while she was sleeping, and he knew she'd give him hell for taking it without her permission. But, she might give him hell anyway.  
他站起身，走到她的门前，轻轻将耳朵贴在冰冷的木门上。他什么也没听到，希望她没有在睡觉。趁她睡觉时拿走卡片感觉不对，他知道她会因为他未经允许就拿走卡片而大发雷霆。但无论如何，她可能都会发火。

Grasping the doorknob with his right hand, he turned it quietly and slowly opened the door.  
他用右手握住门把手，悄无声息地转动，慢慢地打开了门。

"About time baka. I was about to call a nurse to yank your ass in here."  
"终于来了，笨蛋。我差点就要叫护士把你拽进来了。"

Shinji was surprised to hear her scornful voice as though she was waiting for him, but even more surprised that, even though her voice was hard, she seemed to be smiling slightly.  
听到她那带着嘲讽的声音，仿佛一直在等他，这让真嗣感到惊讶，但更让他惊讶的是，尽管她的声音严厉，却似乎带着一丝微笑。

"You were...waiting?" "你...在等我？"

"How could I not be with the racket you were making out there?"  
“你在外面闹得那么凶，我怎么可能听不见？”

Shinji grinned sheepishly, "So you heard everything with Misato?"  
真嗣尴尬地笑了笑，“所以你和美里的一切都听到了？”

Asuka crossed her arms and said, "Who couldn't?"  
明日香交叉双臂说道，“谁会听不见呢？”

Shinji was somewhat embarrassed and unsure how he should proceed. He was waiting for Asuka to start yelling at him for some of the things that he had said out there.  
真嗣感到有些尴尬，不确定该如何继续。他在等待明日香开始对他大吼大叫，因为他在外面说的那些话。

"So? I assume you weren't arguing over nothing out there. What have you decided?"  
“所以呢？我想你们在外面不会无缘无故争吵。你们决定好了吗？”

Shinji looked up into Asuka's face and said, "I think I know, but I still need time to think to be sure. I was hoping I could borrow your security card since I can't get leave without one."  
真嗣抬头看着明日香的脸，说道：“我想我知道了，但我还需要时间思考以确保。我希望我能借用你的安全卡，因为我没有它就无法请假。”

"...Do you plan on leaving?"  
"...你打算离开吗？"

"I've been here for over a week, I'd like to get some fresh air and think for a bit."  
"我已经在这里待了一个多星期了，我想出去透透气，思考一下。"

Asuka frowned, "I suppose. Just don't use it for anything perverted."  
明日香皱了皱眉，"我想是的。只是别用它做任何变态的事。"

"Like what?" "比如什么？"

Asuka narrowed her eyes and whispered something that Shinji scoffed at. The security cards that they were given were also used to make purchases. It was like a debit card.  
明日香眯起眼睛，低声说了些什么，让真嗣嗤之以鼻。他们得到的安全卡也被用来购物。就像一张借记卡。

"You should have more faith in me," mumbled Shinji after a few seconds.  
“你应该对我更有信心，”几秒钟后，真嗣咕哝道。

"All boys are the same once you get past everything else."  
“一旦你抛开其他所有，所有男孩都是一样的。”

"Yeah, yeah...so, are you gonna give it to me?"  
“是是...那么，你会给我吗？”

Asuka hesitated for a second but said, "Yeah...I suppose."  
明日香犹豫了一会儿，但还是说：“嗯...我想是的。”

Turning to her right, she opened a drawer next to her bed and drew out a chain with her card attached to it.  
她转向右边，打开床头柜的抽屉，取出一条挂着她卡片的小链子。

"I'll trust you to not lose it, and if you do I expect full compensation."  
"我会相信你不会弄丢它，如果丢了，我要求全额赔偿。"

"Yes, I know," replied Shinji again.  
"是的，我知道。" 真嗣再次回答道。"

"Good, then get going, I'm tired after having to hear yours and Misato's shouting match."  
"好，那就快去吧，听你和美里吵架，我都累了。"

"Right," mumbled Shinji. "嗯，" 真嗣咕哝道。

Turning towards the door, he got maybe a step in before something grabbed a hold of his wrist. Spinning around, he saw Asuka looking at him forlornly with her bottom teeth biting down on her lower lip.  
他转向门口，刚迈出一步，手腕就被什么东西抓住了。他转过身，看到明日香带着悲伤的眼神看着他，下唇被下齿轻轻咬住。

"If you leave, I won't forgive you," she whispered.  
"如果你离开，我不会原谅你，" 她低声说。

Shinji froze for a second and looked back at her. He wanted to stay...but no, this felt too important to ignore. Simply nodding, he slid his wrist out of Asuka's grasp, and walked out the door.  
真嗣愣了一秒，回头看向她。他想留下来...但不行，这件事感觉太重要了，不能忽视。他只是点了点头，从明日香的手中抽出手腕，走出了门。

The hand that had briefly held Shinji's wrist hung limply at Asuka's side before she brought it up to her face and pressed the back of it lightly against her left cheek.  
那只曾短暂握住真嗣手腕的手无力地垂在明日香身侧，随后她将手举到脸前，轻轻地将手背贴在左颊上。

"Baka," she mumbled, before she rolled over onto her stomach, buried her face in her pillow and tossed the sheets over her head.  
“笨蛋，”她咕哝着，然后翻身趴下，把脸埋在枕头里，把床单拉过头盖住自己。

### Chapter 16: Horrors
第十六章：恐怖

**Sorry about the wait for this. It was originally supposed to come out on Valentines Day, but I get sick and basically wasn't in the mood to do much typing till a week ago, which in hindsight is properly good, since this is a very unvalentines day chapter. Anyways to make up for that I've got something special today. I'm posting two chapters today...why you ask. Because I just turned twenty today. Yeah its my birthday, party crackers for all. Anyway its late so I'm gonna post this and the other in a bit and go to sleep. Can't wait till...later I guess since it is tomorrow. Gonna go to the Oliver Garden (italian restaurant for those of you that don't know, not sure if its in another parts of the US besides Oregon)  
抱歉让大家久等了。原本计划在情人节发布的，但我生病了，基本上直到一周前都没心情打字，现在看来这倒是件好事，因为这一章非常不符合情人节的氛围。为了弥补这一点，今天我准备了一些特别的内容。今天我会发布两章...你问为什么？因为今天我二十岁了。没错，是我的生日，大家一起来庆祝吧。不管怎样，现在已经很晚了，我打算一会儿就发布这两章然后去睡觉。迫不及待想等到...明天再说吧，毕竟已经是今天了。打算去奥利弗花园（一家意大利餐厅，不知道除了俄勒冈州外美国其他地方有没有）。**

---

Shinji was moving fast, in fact, faster then he had probably ever moved in his life. Chances are, if anybody saw him running like this through the corridors of Nerv, he'd be pulled aside instantly. He had managed to avoid most of the security cameras, at least so far. He knew that every gate leading in and out of Nerv had at least three security cameras, giving a complete three hundred and sixty degree view. As long as he could make it there and leave, he should be fine.  
真嗣跑得飞快，实际上，可能比他一生中任何时候都要快。如果有人看到他在 NERV 的走廊里这样狂奔，很可能会立刻被拦下。他设法避开了大部分的监控摄像头，至少到目前为止是这样。他知道，每个进出 NERV 的门至少有三台监控摄像头，提供全方位的三百六十度视角。只要他能赶到那里并离开，应该就没事了。

He still didn't know what he would do though when he left, and thats what was nagging at him. Where exactly should he go? He could walk some of the trails that he used to walk before he met Asuka and Misato, but for some reason, he didn't want to remember those painful times of loneliness. He just needed to leave, leave and think, for thats what Asuka had risked her security card for.  
然而，他仍然不知道离开后该做什么，这才是让他心烦意乱的原因。他到底该去哪里？他可以走一些以前和明日香、美里相遇之前常走的小径，但不知为何，他不想回忆那些孤独的痛苦时光。他只是需要离开，离开并思考，这就是明日香冒着风险用她的安全卡让他离开的原因。

He hoped she wouldn't get in too much trouble, Misato would probably glaze over the small misdemeanor. Shinji knew that letting other Nerv employee's know your security code on the back of your card was subject to confinement for up to three days. But surely it wouldn't count as much. Besides, Asuka could just lie and tell them he took it while she was sleeping. They'd believe it well enough with the current state of affairs.  
他希望她不会惹上太多麻烦，美里大概会对此小过失视而不见。真嗣知道，让其他 NERV 员工知道你卡背面的安全密码可能会被关押长达三天。但这次应该不会算得太严重。况且，明日香完全可以撒谎说他是趁她睡觉时偷看的。以目前的情况来看，他们很可能会相信。

Pausing at the corner of a four way intersection of hallways, Shinji looked around a corner for a brief instance. After catching his breath, and being sure that nobody had seen him, person or camera, he took off in another full sprint.  
在四向走廊的拐角处停下，真嗣迅速瞥了一眼角落。喘了口气，确认无论是人还是摄像头都没发现他后，他又全力冲刺起来。

The gate he was headed for was the closest from the Nerv hospital, in fact, it had been built especially for the sake of bringing injured people straight from downtown Tokyo-3, which was where he was headed.  
他前往的那扇门离 NERV 医院最近，实际上，它就是为了方便将伤员直接从市中心的第三新东京市运送过来而特别建造的。

Finally reaching the elevator that would take him up to the gate, he peaked around the corner briefly, only to jerk his head back to its starting place.  
终于走到通往登机口的电梯前，他迅速探头看了一眼拐角处，随即又猛地将头缩回原位。

"Shit," he mumbled. He had forgotten that there was a camera placed precariously above the elevator.  
“该死，”他低声咒骂。他忘了电梯上方有个摄像头。

Looking around the corner again, he weighed his chances of running straight towards the elevator and being spotted. He supposed he could, and risk security spotting him and forcing a lock down on gate five, which he was just under, or he could...  
再次探头观察，他权衡着直接冲向电梯并被发现的概率。他想，他可以冒险一试，可能会被安保人员发现并导致五号登机口紧急封锁，而他就在附近；或者他可以选择……

'Practice makes perfect,' he thought.  
“熟能生巧，”他心想。

Pressing himself flat against the corner of the wall, he then griped the corner of the wall with his right hand in preparation. In truth, he had no idea whether this would work or not. Whenever he had used his AT-field before, the object of his thought had always been within reaching distance. The camera had to be a good ten meters away though.  
他紧贴着墙角，右手牢牢抓住墙角准备着。实际上，他并不确定这招是否有效。以往使用 AT 力场时，目标总是近在咫尺。但那台摄像机却远在十米之外。

Glancing around the corner, he saw the camera swiveling left and right as it covered the corridors on either side of it, not just the one in front which Shinji was on. Reacting quickly as it moved towards the left, temporarily loosing sight of the middle hallway, Shinji swung his right arm up in a straight arc directed at the camera. At the same time, he thought repeatedly in his head, 'Slice it, Slice it, Slice it!'  
"他瞥了一眼墙角，看到摄像机左右转动，覆盖着两侧的走廊，不仅仅是他所在的那一侧。当摄像机转向左侧，暂时失去了对中间走廊的视线时，真嗣迅速挥起右臂，划出一道直线，直指摄像机。与此同时，他在脑海中反复默念：“切断它，切断它，切断它！”

Shinji felt it before he heard the shattering of the camera and its subsequent fall to the floor. Something which could only be described as what felt like another layer of skin that molded perfectly with his body, shot outwards before changing into a straight line in mid air. The camera lens was split directly in half along with the supports that mounted it to the wall.  
在听到相机破碎和随之坠地的声音之前，真嗣就已经感受到了。一种仿佛是与身体完美贴合的另一层皮肤的东西，突然向外射出，在半空中变成了一条直线。相机镜头连同固定在墙上的支架一起，被直接劈成了两半。

Shinji opened his eyes, just as the camera hit the floor, and shattered into a few more pieces. It may be the pinnacle of surveillance equipment, but its still as fragile as glass.  
就在相机落地并碎成更多碎片的那一刻，真嗣睁开了眼睛。尽管这是监控设备的巅峰之作，但它依然像玻璃一样脆弱。

Trying not to revel in this sudden new surprise at what he was capable of doing, Shinji quickly hurried down the rest of the corridor, punched in the numbers that would take him to the surface, and stepped into the elevator.  
真嗣努力不让自己沉浸在这突如其来的新能力带来的惊喜中，他迅速穿过剩下的走廊，输入了通往地面的数字，然后走进了电梯。

...Meanwhile in a security room not to far from the elevator Shinji had just entered...  
...与此同时，在离电梯不远的安保室内，真嗣刚刚进入...

"Strange..." mumbled the guard. "Camera twenty-two suddenly went silent."  
"奇怪..." 保安喃喃自语，"二十二号摄像头突然没信号了。"

"What happened?" Replied the other.  
"发生什么事了？" 另一人回应道。"

"I don't know but...wait...somebody is in the elevator leading to gate number five."  
"我不知道，但是...等等...有人进了通往五号门的电梯。"

"Unauthorized?" "未经授权？"

"Seems to be that way."  
"看起来是这样。"

"Better call it up then."  
“那就赶紧打个电话吧。”

---

Misato had certainly lived through better days then the ones she was currently experiencing. She couldn't believe that she had her first fight with Shinji. Sure they had argued a few times, but she had never seen such loathing in his eyes as he berated her about being a bad parent. Did he honestly expect her to be happy with the current situation? Of course she hated it, but she had tried her best!  
美里确实经历过比现在更好的日子。她无法相信自己竟然和真嗣发生了第一次争吵。当然，他们有过几次争执，但她从未见过他眼中如此的憎恶，当他斥责她是个糟糕的父母时。他真的期望她对当前的状况感到满意吗？她当然讨厌这一切，但她已经尽力了！

Turning away from the stack of papers that sat on her desk, she swiveled around in her chair, placed her elbows on her knees, and rested her chin in her hands.  
她转过身，从桌上的那堆文件中抽离视线，旋转椅子，将手肘撑在膝盖上，双手托着下巴。

By having Shinji and Asuka living with her, was she trying to act out the position of being a parent? What was a guardian then? Some form of authority at its most basics most likely. Shinji and Asuka were just too young to live by themselves, no matter how much either desired it.  
通过让真嗣和明日香与她同住，她是否在试图扮演父母的角色？那么监护人又是什么呢？最基本的，可能是一种权威形式。无论真嗣和明日香多么渴望独立，他们毕竟还太年轻，无法独自生活。

She had never seriously thought of having kids before, it had always seemed something from another world. Certainly she had wondered what it would be like as any young adult woman does, but that was when she had been in college, and still clueless about the workings of the world. And yet, there had been times with Kaji when she had thought what raising a family would have been like with him. But neither of them could have handled that sort of responsibility. Now she was wondering if she could even handle two teenagers.  
她从未认真考虑过要孩子，这似乎总是另一个世界的事情。当然，像所有年轻女性一样，她也曾好奇过那会是什么感觉，但那是在大学时期，她对世界的运作仍一无所知。然而，与加持在一起的某些时刻，她曾幻想过与他共同抚养家庭的情景。但两人都无法承担那样的责任。现在，她不禁怀疑自己是否能应付两个青少年。

She felt ashamed of saying it, but when she had learned about the probability of Shinji having angel powers, she felt scared of him. She now realized how wrong that had been, and how it had affected Shinji. Shinji and Asuka had there ups and downs, no use denying it. But she had always been there and supported him. But when she became afraid of what he might be, she shunned him. Because of that, he seemed to resent her, and blamed her because of what happened to Asuka.  
她为自己说出这样的话感到羞愧，但当她得知真嗣可能拥有天使之力时，她对他感到恐惧。现在她意识到那有多么错误，以及它对真嗣的影响。真嗣和明日香有过起起落落，否认这一点毫无意义。但她一直都在那里支持着他。然而，当她开始害怕他可能成为的样子时，她疏远了他。正因为如此，他似乎怨恨她，并因明日香发生的事情而责怪她。

"But it wasn't my fault," she whispered with her face now resting in her hands. "I took every precaution available, I tried to have the commander change pilots or choose the fourth. I tried!"  
“但那不是我的错，”她将脸埋在双手中低声说道，“我采取了所有可用的预防措施，我试图让指挥官更换驾驶员或选择第四位。我尽力了！”

Misato suddenly jumped in her chair, startled as the phone on her desk rang amongst the many papers and documents. Turning towards her desk, she shifted some of the papers out of the way, only to stare at the number on the phone. If she remembered correctly six, seven, one, was the area code for a guard post stationed just before the gate leading to downtown Tokyo-3.  
美里突然从椅子上跳了起来，被桌上的电话铃声吓了一跳，电话周围堆满了文件和纸张。她转向桌子，挪开一些文件，只是盯着电话上的号码。如果她没记错的话，六、七、一是位于通往第三新东京市市中心大门前的一个警卫哨所的区号。

Picking it up hesitantly, she said, "This is Major Misato..."  
她犹豫地拿起它，说道：“这是美里少校……”

"Major, we have a security breach over here at gate five, one of our security cameras was taken out, and the suspect is traveling up the elevator."  
“少校，我们在五号门这里发生了安全漏洞，其中一个监控摄像头被破坏了，嫌疑人正乘坐电梯上行。”

"Initiated the automatic shutdown of the elevator."  
“已启动电梯自动关闭程序。”

"We can't, the person must be a Nerv employee because he overrode the emergency shutdown access code."  
"我们做不到，那个人必须是 NERV 的员工，因为他重写了紧急关机访问码。"

"Force a lockdown on gate five."  
"强制封锁五号门。"

"We wont make it in time."  
"我们来不及了。"

"Damn it! Did the camera get a shot of the intruder before it was taken out?"  
"该死！摄像头在被破坏前拍到了入侵者的照片吗？"

"No, all we were able to see was a single frame in the video where it showed a flash of orange light before the camera was destroyed."  
"没有，我们只能看到视频中的一帧，显示了一道橙色闪光，随后摄像头就被摧毁了。"

"What!" “什么！”

"Is something wrong Major?"  
"有什么问题吗，少校？"

Misato bit her tongue for a second before she said, "Put me through to the hospital, ward number eleven, and let me know when the suspect passes through the gate. At most we'll be able to know who it is with their security card."  
美里咬了咬舌头，片刻后说道：“接通医院十一号病房，并在我知道嫌疑人通过大门时通知我。我们最多能通过他们的安全卡知道是谁。”

"Very well Major." “遵命，少校。”

Misato heard the click as the guard disconnected and the beeping, as she was connected to the hospital ward. She had a feeling who was leaving via gate number five, but wanted to be sure. The gate was after all closest to the hospital."  
美里听到警卫挂断的咔嗒声和接通医院病房的嘟嘟声。她有种预感是谁从五号门离开，但想确认一下。毕竟，那扇门离医院最近。

Finally a female voice came on the phone and said, "Nerv hospital, ward number eleven, how may I help you."  
终于，电话那头传来一个女性的声音，说道：“这里是 NERV 医院，十一号病房，有什么可以帮您的？”

"This is Major Misato. Put me through to room 301, and make it quick!"  
“我是美里少校。给我接 301 号房间，快点！”

"At once, Major." “马上办，少校。”

After several seconds, Misato heard a click and Asuka's voice as she answered the phone.  
几秒钟后，Misato 听到了一声咔嗒声，接着是 Asuka 接电话的声音。

"Yes, what is it," Asuka grumbled slightly?  
“是的，什么事，”Asuka 略带不悦地咕哝道？

"Asuka, its Misato." “Asuka，是我，Misato。”

"Is something wrong?" "有什么不对劲吗？"

"Is Shinji with you?" "真嗣和你在一起吗？"

"No, he's not. Should he be?"  
"没有，他不在。他应该在吗？"

"I think he might have left and just thought you might know whether he had left or not?"  
"我觉得他可能已经离开了，只是想你可能知道他是否真的走了？"

"Wouldn't you find that out faster then I would considering I'm stuck here," said Asuka with a slight hint of amusement in her voice.  
"考虑到我被困在这里，你不是应该比我更快知道吗？" 明日香带着一丝戏谑的语气说道。

"Asuka! Did Shinji tell you he was leaving!"  
"明日香！真嗣有没有告诉你他要离开！"

There was a slight pause before Asuka replied, "Whatever he decides to do if he leaves is entirely up to him."  
在回答之前，明日香稍稍停顿了一下，“无论他离开后决定做什么，都完全取决于他自己。”

"Damn it Asuka! Did you give him your pass card, because if you did I-"  
“该死的明日香！你是不是把你的通行卡给他了，如果是的话我——”

"Court martial me? Not likely since I'm an Eva pilot."  
“要军事法庭审判我吗？不太可能，毕竟我是 Eva 驾驶员。”

"Asuka do you realize what you've done?"  
"明日香，你知道你做了什么吗？"

"...Its not like he's going to do anything that would put Nerv in a bad position."  
"……他又不会做出什么让 NERV 陷入不利境地的事。"

"But he may never come back! Surely you realize that!"  
"但他可能永远都不会回来了！你肯定明白这一点吧！"

"No, he will come back."  
"不，他会回来的。"

"How can you be so sure-"  
"你怎么能这么肯定——"

"Because I believe him," replied Asuka with such a strong voice that Misato had to pause several seconds before replying, "How can you be sure though?"  
"因为我相信他，" 明日香用如此坚定的声音回答，使得美里不得不停顿了几秒钟才回应，"可你怎么能确定呢？"

Misato thought she caught a slight laugh in Asuka's reply as she said, "Because he knows that I'd find him no matter where he went on this planet and give him hell for breaking his promise to me."  
美里觉得她在明日香的回答中捕捉到了一丝轻笑，她说：“因为他知道，无论他在这个星球上的哪个角落，我都会找到他，并因为他违背了对我的承诺而让他吃尽苦头。”

Misato was silent for almost a thirty-seconds before Asuka said quietly, "He'll be back. Maybe not tomorrow...or the day after, but he will be, because he knows I'm waiting for him."  
美里沉默了近三十秒，然后明日香轻声说道：“他会回来的。也许不是明天……或者后天，但他会的，因为他知道我在等他。”

"...Asuka..." "...明日香..."

"Sorry Misato but I'm still tired, so if we're done, I'd like to get back to sleep."  
“抱歉，美里，但我还是很累，所以如果我们谈完了，我想回去睡觉。”

"Asuka you realize that if Shinji doesn't return...then you really _could_ face the possibility of a court martial."  
"明日香，你意识到如果真嗣不回来...那么你真的可能面临军事法庭的审判。"

"Good, then I'd have all the time in the world to find that idiot."  
"好啊，那样我就有全世界的时间去找那个白痴了。"

Asuka hung up without another word, leaving Misato with nothing but the ringing of Asuka's last words in her ears.  
明日香没再说一句话就挂断了电话，留下美里耳边回荡着她最后的话语声。

Hanging the phone up, she saw the light flashing on and off her answering machine and pressed it. Predictably, it had been the guard that had talked to her earlier and he described the portrait of the person leaving Nerv. Though he was puzzled as the security card rang up something different then what the cameras had shown. After a minute of his lengthly description, Misato pressed the hang up button and leaned back in her chair.  
挂断电话后，她注意到答录机上的指示灯在闪烁，便按下了播放键。不出所料，是之前与她通话的警卫，他描述了离开 NERV 的人的肖像。尽管他感到困惑，因为安全卡显示的信息与摄像头捕捉到的画面不符。在他的冗长描述后，美里按下了挂断键，靠回椅背上。

She felt like she had failed not only Asuka, but now Shinji also as a guardian.  
她觉得自己不仅在监护阿斯卡方面失败了，现在连真嗣也未能尽到监护人的责任。

---

Even the stale air of Tokyo-3 never smelled so sweet as it did now that Shinji finally made it out into the open air. Stretching his legs to the point where he could feel his underused muscles cramping up, he threw his arms behind his head and gazed up into the blue sky of Tokyo-3. It had been...what, over a week since he saw blue skies? No, longer than that, since it had been raining those past few days before he had been taken to Nerv.  
即使是东京-3 那陈腐的空气，此刻也从未如此甜美，因为真嗣终于走出了封闭的空间，呼吸到了新鲜空气。他伸展双腿，直到感到久未使用的肌肉开始抽搐，然后将双臂枕在脑后，仰望东京-3 的蓝天。已经……多久没见过蓝天了？不，比那更久，因为在被带到 NERV 之前的那几天一直在下雨。

'Now...what to do," he wondered?  
'现在...该做什么呢，'他思索着？

Starting off in a walk that was unsure of its final destination, he let his feet take him wherever they wanted to go while his mind wandered.  
他开始漫无目的地走着，任由双脚带他去任何它们想去的地方，而思绪则四处游荡。

First then...why did he pilot?  
首先...他为什么要驾驶呢？

'Because I'm told to,' said a voice in his head.  
‘因为这是命令，’他脑海中有个声音说道。

'No...thats not right.' ‘不……这样不对。’

'But people expect you to, because you have talent.'  
‘但人们期望你这么做，因为你有天赋。’

'So they push there own responsibilities and desires onto me.'  
'所以他们把自己的责任和欲望都推给我。'

'Why do you loath contact between other humans?'  
'你为什么厌恶与其他人的接触？'

'Because nobody loves me. They only care about themselves.'  
'因为没有人爱我。他们只关心自己。'

'So you pilot to acquire the love that was missing in your life?'  
'所以你驾驶飞船去寻找生活中缺失的爱？'

'No! Thats not it!' '不！不是那样的！'

'What do you wish for? What does your heart desire?'  
'你渴望什么？你的心究竟向往什么？'

'I don't know.' '我不知道。'

'Why don't you know?' '你为什么不知道？'

'I don't know! I don't know what love feels like because I've never been loved!'  
'我不知道！我不知道爱是什么感觉，因为我从未被爱过！'

'What about Misato? Asuka? Rei? What do you feel for them?'  
'那美里呢？明日香？丽？你对她们有什么感觉？'

'They...I don't know.' '她们...我不知道。'

'You don't want to know...because you're afraid of being hurt.'  
'你不想知道...因为你害怕受到伤害。'

'Stop it!' '别这样！'

These last words Shinji blurted out into the open air. Looking wildly around for a minute, he realized he had come a good ways from gate five. Glancing towards his left and right, he tried to place where he was with the map of Tokyo-3 that resided in his head. Whatever his grades looked like, he always seemed to memorize things easier then most people.  
这最后几句话，真嗣脱口而出，飘散在空气中。他疯狂地环顾四周片刻，意识到自己已经从五号门走出了很远。他左右张望，试图根据脑海中东京-3 的地图确定自己的位置。不管成绩如何，他总是比大多数人更容易记住事情。

There was a shop on his left that looked as though it had come right out of the 1800's, while on his right there seemed to be a small cafe of some sort. Hesitating briefly, his grumbling stomach won over his common logic, and he crossed the street, and walked in.  
他左边有一家店铺，看起来像是直接从 19 世纪搬来的，而右边则似乎是一家小咖啡馆。犹豫片刻后，他咕咕作响的肚子战胜了理智，于是他穿过街道，走了进去。

It seemed even smaller then what he had seen outside. Upon walking into the small shop, the first thing he saw was the wooden counter that ran along in half a circle. Seated behind it was a woman, a little older than him that had dark brown hair streaked with a darkened red. She was reading a book of sorts and Shinji understood that to mean that this place rarely got any customers.  
走进这家小店，它似乎比从外面看还要小。首先映入眼帘的是一个半圆形延伸的木制柜台。坐在柜台后面的是一位女士，比他稍长几岁，深棕色的头发中夹杂着暗红色。她正在阅读一本书，这让真嗣明白这个地方很少有顾客光临。

Seated next to the windows directly to the left and right of him were several small wooden tables with one or two chairs around them. A few of them even had a small glass vase with flowers in them, attempting to improve the look of the place. Several hanging fans with light fixtures spun above him and blew cool air into his face, as if he had needed it. The walls were mostly bare and devoid of pictures or paintings except for a rather dull looking picture of a cup of coffee that was placed behind the wooden counter. Shinji couldn't understand how this place was still in business.  
直接坐在他左右两侧的窗户旁，有几张小木桌，每张桌子周围有一两把椅子。其中几张桌子上甚至放着一个小玻璃花瓶，里面插着花，试图改善这个地方的外观。几盏带有灯饰的吊扇在他头顶旋转，吹来凉风拂面，仿佛他真的需要这股凉意。墙壁大多光秃秃的，没有图片或画作，除了柜台后面挂着的一幅相当乏味的咖啡杯画。真嗣无法理解这家店是如何维持生意的。

Walking up to the counter, he got a closer look at the girls face and realized that she wasn't all that bad looking. He suddenly felt a chill down his spine though and seemed to think that he had just angered somebody greatly. It was a ridiculous thought, and besides, its not like he was tied down or anything.  
走到柜台前，他更清楚地看到了女孩的脸，意识到她其实并不难看。然而，他突然感到一阵寒意顺着脊梁骨而下，似乎觉得自己刚刚大大地惹恼了某人。这想法很荒谬，而且，他又没有被束缚住什么的。

Seeing that she had a customer, the girl put down her book, and walked up to the register.  
看到有顾客来，女孩放下手中的书，走到收银台前。

"What can I get you?"  
“您要点什么？”

Shinji was rather taken aback at the tone of her voice as it was quite clear that she didn't enjoy being interrupted in the middle of reading. Whats more though, the tone and inflection reminded him strongly of somebody else.  
真嗣对她的语气感到相当意外，显然她不喜欢在阅读中途被打断。更甚的是，这种语调和抑扬顿挫让他强烈地想起了某个人。

"Well?" She asked again, this time with a raised eyebrow.  
“嗯？”她再次问道，这次挑起了眉毛。

"Sorry," Shinji mumbled. Glancing at the menu, he didn't feel as though his stomach had any preference today and just went with two deli sandwiches and a small cola.  
“对不起，”真嗣咕哝着。瞥了一眼菜单，他觉得今天胃里没什么特别偏好，于是随便点了两个熟食三明治和一小杯可乐。

The girl was unsociable as she rang up Shinji's order, and retreated to the back of the cafe to get his food. Shinji was honestly wondering how fresh a sandwich could be if it was kept in the back of a cafe.  
女孩在为真嗣结账时显得很不合群，随后退到咖啡馆后部去取他的食物。真嗣真心怀疑，如果三明治放在咖啡馆后部，它还能有多新鲜。

Returning to the front of the cafe, the girl placed the wrapped sandwich and turned to fill Shinji's cup of cola. After filling it to the brim, she turned to Shinji and said in a crass voice, "Five seventy-five."  
回到咖啡馆前台，女孩将包装好的三明治放下，转身去给真嗣的可乐杯加满。倒至杯口后，她转向真嗣，用粗鲁的语气说：“五美元七十五美分。”

Shinji had completely forgotten about paying for his meal and winced again, as another cold streak ran down his spine. Hesitating, unsure of how he should proceed, he heard a small voice in his head say, 'Go ahead and use the card, its not like this is wrong or anything.'  
真嗣完全忘记了付账的事，再次打了个寒颤，又一股寒意顺着脊梁骨而下。犹豫不决，不知该如何是好，他听到脑海中有个细小的声音说：“用卡吧，这又没什么不对的。”

'But I feel bad, using Asuka's card for food,' he replied back.  
'但我用明日香的卡买食物，感觉不太好，' 他回复道。

'What will you do then, starve?'  
'那你打算怎么办，饿肚子吗？'

Thankfully, Shinji's reply was unnecessary as the girl at the counter said, "Are you paying or what!"  
幸运的是，真嗣的回复变得多余，因为柜台的女孩催促道：“你到底付不付钱！”

Pulling Shinji out of his reprieve, he glanced at her and saw contempt on her face. He had a sudden surge of annoyance that he had not felt in some time course through him.  
将真嗣从短暂的解脱中拉回现实，他瞥了她一眼，看到她脸上的轻蔑。一股久违的恼怒突然涌上心头。

'Cool it,' he reminded himself. 'Flying off the handle now would only make matters worse.'  
“冷静点，”他提醒自己，“现在发脾气只会让事情更糟。”

So, calming himself down, he muttered, "Right, sorry," and fished Asuka's security card out of his pocket.  
于是，他努力平复心情，低声说道：“好吧，抱歉。”然后从口袋里掏出了明日香的安全卡。

Either the girl didn't bother to check the picture or name on the card when she swiped it through the slot, or she simply didn't care, because it only left Shinji's hand for three seconds.  
要么是那女孩懒得检查卡片上的图片或名字就刷过了插槽，要么她根本不在乎，因为卡片只在真嗣手里停留了三秒钟。

Depositing the card in his pocket, he turned with his food in hand and without another glance, started walking towards the door, though something held him back. Turning suddenly to his right, and not quite sure what he was doing, he walked over the table in the farthest corner of the right wall, and sat himself down in a chair facing the window.  
他将卡片塞进口袋，手里端着食物转身离开，没有再多看一眼，径直朝门口走去，但某种东西让他停下了脚步。突然转向右边，不太确定自己在做什么，他走到右墙最远处的桌子旁，坐了下来，面朝窗户。

It took him a few seconds to realize that he was still inside the cafe, and he couldn't understand why his feet had suddenly decided to take a detour. Was his subconscious telling him to stay here? That was certainly stupid.  
他花了好几秒钟才意识到自己还在咖啡馆里，不明白为什么双脚突然决定绕个弯。难道是他的潜意识在告诉他留在这里？这想法确实很蠢。

'Fuck it,' he thought. '去他妈的，' 他心想。

Unwrapping his sandwich, he glanced up briefly at the counter, only to see that the girl had sat back down on her stool with her book back in her hand. It seemed she wasn't pleased with Shinji's sudden decision, as her eyebrows seemed to have come together. Well, Shinji wasn't happy with it either, but it appeared that he had stopped here for a reason maybe.  
他解开三明治的包装，抬头匆匆瞥了一眼柜台，只见那女孩又坐回到她的凳子上，手里拿着书。看来她对真嗣突然的决定不太满意，因为她的眉毛似乎皱在了一起。好吧，真嗣自己也不高兴，但似乎他停在这里是有原因的。

Tearing a bight out of the sandwich, he started chewing it methodically, as he churned over what he thought he should do.  
他撕下一块三明治，开始有条不紊地咀嚼，同时思索着自己应该怎么做。

Admittedly, though he really _didn't_ want to admit it, he didn't think he could leave Nerv, or at least, he would destroy himself in the process of leaving. The truth was, that he had become used to being around everyone, to enjoy the presence of people around him. He had even become accustomed to piloting Eva, if that sounded logical at.  
不可否认，尽管他真的不想承认，他认为自己无法离开 NERV，或者至少，在离开的过程中他会自我毁灭。事实是，他已经习惯了周围的人，享受着他们的陪伴。他甚至习惯了驾驶 EVA，如果这听起来合乎逻辑的话。

Then of course there was Asuka; he wasn't sure if her existence was a blessing, or a plague upon him. Maybe deep down, he knew he'd never be able to leave, but because of her? Well, he supposed it was likely, but he...just didn't know what he felt. It was sorta just nothing, he supposed. It didn't feel like anything was there, like there never had been. Or maybe...it wasn't something that he could feel, not like a physical form, but neither as something spiritual. Maybe it was because she was missing, like a part of him was gone...or something.  
当然还有明日香；他不确定她的存在是福还是祸。也许在内心深处，他知道自己永远无法离开，但因为她的缘故？嗯，他猜这很有可能，但他...就是不知道自己的感受。他觉得好像什么都没有，他猜。感觉就像那里从未有过什么。或者也许...这不是他能感受到的东西，不是像实体那样的感觉，也不是精神上的东西。也许是因为她不在，就像他的一部分消失了...或者别的什么。

'So damn confusing,' he thought as he put his sandwich down and took a swig of his cola.  
“真是他妈的让人困惑，”他想，放下三明治，喝了一口可乐。

And then there was of course the nagging question of who he was. What was his significance in the Human Instrumentality Project, for he was certainly a key factor? Was his father banking on the fact that he wouldn't leave, or had he already out lived his usefulness? Why did he exhibit angel powers? Why was he able to generate an AT-field? Why was he so different?  
当然，还有一个挥之不去的问题：他是谁？他在人类补完计划中扮演着什么角色，因为他显然是一个关键因素？他的父亲是否寄希望于他不会离开，还是他已经失去了利用价值？为什么他会展现出天使般的力量？为什么他能生成 AT 力场？为什么他如此与众不同？

His father, it always came back to that. What exactly did he know? What was he trying to keep Shinji in the dark about? Who else knew what he might be? Ritsuko? Fuyutsuki? ...Rei, maybe?  
他的父亲，问题总是回到这一点上。他究竟知道些什么？他想对真嗣隐瞒什么？还有谁知道他可能的身份？律子？冬月？...也许还有绫波？

A sudden cough made him jump as he had quite forgotten that he was not alone in the store. Looking up at the counter, he saw that the girl at it was pinching the space in between her eyebrows absently. Shinji could only guess that she was irritated at his presence. Well, he couldn't really blame her.  
突然的一声咳嗽让他吓了一跳，他完全忘记了店里并非只有他一个人。抬头望向柜台，他看到那女孩正无意识地揉着眉间。真嗣只能猜测她是对他的存在感到不悦。嗯，他确实不能怪她。

As Shinji looked away, he was about the take another bight out of his sandwich when he caught glimpse of the book she was reading, and before he could stop himself he was blurting out, "Isn't that _The Catcher in the Rye?"_  
"当真嗣移开视线，正准备再咬一口三明治时，他瞥见了她正在读的那本书，还没来得及阻止自己，就脱口而出：“那不是《麦田里的守望者》吗？””

A long moment of silence passed inside the shop as Shinji slightly rebuked his sudden question. It was rather rude he thought. Though he was surprised as she replied back moments later with a stiff, "Yeah, it is."  
"在店里，长时间的沉默笼罩着，真嗣对自己突如其来的问题感到些许懊悔。他认为这相当无礼。然而，令他惊讶的是，片刻后她僵硬地回答：“是的，就是那本。””

Shinji, unsure of how he was supposed to reply, took a quick sip of his drink and was about to raise the sandwich to his mouth when he heard a question, which sounded as though it didn't care if it was answered or not.  
真嗣不确定该如何回应，迅速喝了一口饮料，正要将三明治举到嘴边时，听到了一个问题，听起来似乎并不在乎是否得到回答。

"Why, have you read it?"  
"怎么，你读过吗？"

Shinji looked up from his meal and turned towards the counter and was rather surprised to see that she was looking at him.  
真嗣从餐盘中抬起头，转向柜台，颇为惊讶地发现她在看着他。

"Sorta...I'm reading it right now, though I haven't been able to read any for almost a week now."  
"算是吧...我现在正在读，不过已经差不多一个星期没读过了。"

"Hmmm, is it a school thing?"  
"嗯，是学校的事吗？"

"No, I'm reading it on my own time."  
"不，我是在自己的时间里读的。"

She looked at him evenly for a second before replying, "...I see."  
她平静地看了他一秒钟，然后回答道：“……我明白了。”

Shinji watched her for a few seconds before turning back towards his sandwich. It wasn't exactly conversational, but he had a better impression of her at least.  
真嗣盯着她看了几秒钟，然后转回身继续吃他的三明治。虽然这不算什么对话，但至少他对她的印象好了一些。

Finishing his first sandwich, he was about ready to start on his second, when the front door of the cafe when flying open, bounced off the opposite wall, only to be kicked as it swung back into place. Shinji watched, with his second sandwich half way to his mouth, as three burly men marched into the cafe and planted themselves in front of the wooden cabin. Something about the way they were shifting their weight back and forth made Shinji feel a certain ominous presence, as though each of them had something bulky and concealed in their jackets.  
吃完第一个三明治后，他正准备开始吃第二个，这时咖啡馆的前门突然被猛地推开，撞到对面的墙上，又被一脚踢回原位。真嗣看着手中的第二个三明治刚送到嘴边，三个魁梧的男人大步走进咖啡馆，站在木屋前。他们来回挪动的样子让真嗣感到一种不祥的气息，仿佛每个人外套下都藏着什么沉重的东西。

Whoever the girl was, she seemed to recognize the three, because she immediately put her book down and hurried around the side of the counter before ending up in front of the men. Shinji seemed to be completely forgotten during this exchange, and suddenly realized he was holding his breath.  
不管那女孩是谁，她似乎认出了这三个人，因为她立刻放下书，匆匆绕过柜台，最后站在了那些人面前。真嗣在这场交流中似乎完全被遗忘了，他突然意识到自己一直屏住呼吸。

The tallest of the three stepped forward as the girl skidded to a half in front of them. Shinji saw him smile, and counted several golden teeth.  
三人中个子最高的那个向前迈了一步，女孩在他们面前滑停了下来。真嗣看到他笑了，数了数有几颗金牙。

"Becca my darling, how goes business today?"  
“贝卡，亲爱的，今天生意如何？”

"I'm sorry Eein, I have not had many customers toda-"  
“对不起，艾因，今天顾客不多——”

"Bah! Again ya useless tramp! What good are ya if ya can't run a simple business!"  
"哼！又是你这个没用的废物！连个简单的生意都经营不好，你有什么用！"

"Please...this place is in such of an out of the way area that people don't want to come."  
"拜托...这个地方太偏僻了，人们都不愿意来。"

"Maybe we out to change the menu a little boss."  
"也许我们应该稍微调整一下菜单，老板。"

Eein turned towards his friend and said, "Like what Gonzo?"  
伊恩转向他的朋友说：“像什么，冈佐？”

"How about, 'Blowjobs five dollars a pop, and titfucks for an extra fifty cents.'"  
“比如，‘口交五美元一次，乳交再加五十分。’”

"You never cease to amaze me Gonzo," replied Eein, as he roared with laughter. "I like it! And she has to keep sucking till she blows their load. Should we give the option of take home photographs so the sleazy perverts can all have something to wank off to when there lonely?"  
“冈佐，你总是让我刮目相看，”伊恩大笑着回答，“我喜欢这个主意！而且她得一直吸到他们射出来。我们是不是应该提供外带照片的选项，这样那些猥琐的变态们孤独时也有东西可以自慰？”

"Boom goes the dynamite," cackled Gonzo as he made a jerking gesture with his right hand.  
"砰的一声，炸药爆炸了，" Gonzo 咯咯笑着，用右手做了一个抽动的动作。

Eein chuckled lightly as he turned towards Rebecca. "So what do ya think? Could you bring in more money that way?"  
Eein 轻声笑了笑，转向 Rebecca。"你觉得怎么样？你能那样赚更多的钱吗？"

Rebecca tried to hide the sadness that welled up in her eyes. "I...don't know, Eein."  
Rebecca 试图掩饰眼中涌起的悲伤。"我...不知道，Eein。"

"Course you don't ya little tramp. You'll do what you're told and not complain about it. So, ya had to have at least one customer today, where's the money?"  
“当然你不会，你这个小荡妇。你得照吩咐做事，别抱怨。所以，你今天至少得有一个客人，钱呢？”

"But-" "但——"

"I take a profit of the money and leave the rest for you're shitless mother. That was the deal...so where is it!"  
“我只拿走我那份钱，剩下的留给你们那无用的母亲。那是协议……所以钱在哪儿！”

Rebecca hung her head as she turned to walk back around the corner, while Eein followed her. Opening the register, Rebecca stood to the side as Eein examined the contents.  
丽贝卡低下头，转身走回拐角处，而艾因紧随其后。丽贝卡打开收银机，站在一旁，让艾因检查里面的内容。

"This it," he exclaimed as he looked at the measly ten dollars and twenty-five cents that sat in the register.  
"就是这些了，" 他看着收银机里那可怜的十美元二十五美分，大声说道。

"I-I did have a customer pay with a card-"  
"我——我确实有一个顾客用信用卡支付了——"

"Dumb fuck! What did I tell you about that hmmmm! We only except cash!"  
"蠢货！我跟你说过多少次了，嗯！我们只收现金！"

"I'm sorry, I forgot..." "对不起，我忘了..."

"You seem to forget a lot...tch whatever."  
"你似乎经常忘记...啧，算了。"

Swiping the money out of the register, he thumbed through it briefly before chucking the twenty-five cents back into the register.  
他从收银机里抽出钱，粗略地翻了翻，然后又将那二十五美分扔回收银机。

"Theres your salary for the day, do what ever the fuck you want with it, even if its for that dying sack of shit of a mother."  
"这是你今天的薪水，随便你怎么花，哪怕是为了你那快死的、烂泥一样的母亲。"

"Thank you-" "谢谢你——"

"You better get down on your fucking knees and kiss my ass. Without me, your mother would be in the fucking ground six feet under."  
"你最好跪下来亲我的屁股。没有我，你妈早就埋在地下六英尺了。"

"I know." "我知道。"

"I really don't think you do," replied Eein with a snarl, as his hand suddenly shot outward and grabbed Rebecca's right breast. Rebecca winced in pain as the large fingers and long finger nails started to dig into the soft flesh.  
"我真的不认为你知道，" Eein 咆哮着回答，他的手突然向外一伸，抓住了 Rebecca 的右胸。Rebecca 因那粗大的手指和长长的指甲开始刺入柔软的肉体而痛苦地皱起了眉头。

"You picked a bad day to irk me, girl. I got pretty pissed earlier and broke some sluts chin for not knowing where her place was; down on all fours howling like a dog. I've got plenty of tension built up right now and would love to release some of it into your pussy. Maybe you'd like to take her place for a bit. I'm sure I could get you squealing like a pig in a matter of seconds."  
"你挑了个惹恼我的糟糕日子，女孩。我之前已经很生气了，因为一个婊子不知道自己的位置，我打碎了她的下巴；她像狗一样趴在地上嚎叫。我现在积攒了很多紧张情绪，很想把它释放到你的阴道里。也许你想暂时取代她的位置。我肯定能让你在几秒钟内像猪一样尖叫。"

Gesturing towards his crew on the other side of the counter, they started walking around so they would soon join there boss in the screw fest. However, as Eein reached for the neckline of Rebecca's shirt, a loud 'clunk' echoed around the small cafe as Shinji slammed what remained of his drink down on the table, sloshing most of the rest of his drink over the side of his cup.  
他向柜台另一边的船员们示意，他们开始绕行，很快就要加入他们的老板，参与这场混乱。然而，当 Eein 伸手去拉 Rebecca 的衬衫领口时，一声响亮的'咔嗒'声在小咖啡馆里回荡，Shinji 将剩下的饮料猛地砸在桌子上，大部分饮料溅出了杯子。

Shinji caught movement immediately as Gonzo and the other thug reached into their coat pockets, but froze their hands when they saw it was just a kid. Looking wildly around at there boss, Eein glanced at Shinji, before nodding towards his two thugs. One dead middle schooler wasn't going to hurt the world a bit.  
Shinji 立刻注意到 Gonzo 和其他暴徒把手伸进外套口袋的动作，但当他们发现只是个孩子时，手就僵住了。他们狂乱地看向老板 Eein，Eein 瞥了一眼 Shinji，然后向他的两个暴徒点头示意。一个死掉的中学生不会对这个世界造成任何伤害。

As Gonzo and the other started pulling out there concealed weapons, the pressure in the room changed dramatically. During the exchange of words, Shinji had watched everything carefully. He didn't want to get himself involved unless he saw absolutely no other option. He didn't want a repeat of the rapist, and this would have been three dead men. He had calmly assessed his options, and decided if worst came to worse, he could threaten them to a certain degree. However, when he heard what Eein was going to do to the girl called Rebecca, Shinji had come very close to lashing out in anger and lopping Eein's head off.  
当 Gonzo 和其他人开始掏出隐藏的武器时，房间内的气氛骤然紧张起来。在言语交锋中，Shinji 仔细观察着一切。除非别无选择，否则他不想卷入其中。他不想重蹈覆辙，那将是三条人命的代价。他冷静地评估了自己的选择，决定在最坏的情况下，他可以适度地威胁他们。然而，当听到 Eein 打算对名叫 Rebecca 的女孩做什么时，Shinji 几乎按捺不住愤怒，差点就要砍下 Eein 的头颅。

Now though, he felt like he was in complete control of the situation. They way he presented his posture, showed that he was utterly lax, and yet the thugs could feel a killing intent coming from him so strong that it was almost constricting their throats. It was like a large weight was suddenly being pressed down on top of them, so much that there backs were threatening to bend. Shinji could almost hear the frantic beating of the three hearts as they waited for him to make a move. The air was suddenly stifling as though Shinji's anger was coursing through the air, and throughout it all, he looked almost serene, and that was the worst part. They got the impression that if he so much as moved his right hand, they would all die.  
然而此刻，他感觉自己完全掌控了局面。他的姿态展现出一种绝对的放松，但那些暴徒却能感受到从他身上散发出的强烈杀意，几乎让他们窒息。仿佛有一股巨大的压力突然压在他们身上，以至于他们的背都快要弯曲了。真嗣几乎能听到那三颗心脏因等待他行动而狂跳的声音。空气突然变得压抑，仿佛真嗣的愤怒在空气中流淌，而在这整个过程中，他看起来却几乎平静，这反而是最糟糕的部分。他们有种感觉，如果他只是动了动右手，他们都会丧命。

The other thug suddenly took a hesitant step back as he felt Shinji's eyes boar into him. Gonzo looked wildly around at his boss and was surprised that his boss was looking intently at Shinji, as though deciding whether or not he could kill the kid before he killed him.  
另一个暴徒突然犹豫地后退了一步，因为他感觉到真嗣的目光如利箭般射向他。Gonzo 疯狂地环顾四周，看向他的老板，惊讶地发现老板正专注地盯着真嗣，似乎在决定是否能在真嗣杀他之前先杀掉这个孩子。

The two glared each other down, while Shinji was getting anxious and was tempted to scare them with his AT-field, when Eein pulled back.  
两人互相瞪视，而真嗣越来越焦虑，甚至想用 AT 力场吓唬他们，这时 Eein 退缩了。

"Sorry that ya had to see that kid," he mumbled, doing a little mock bow in front of Shinji. It was almost as though he was mocking him.  
"抱歉让你这小子看到了，"他咕哝着，在真嗣面前做了个小小的假鞠躬。这几乎像是在嘲弄他。

"Come on guys, we got other stops to make."  
"好了，伙计们，我们还有其他地方要去。"

Without another word, the three thugs exited the shop and passed down the street.  
没再多说一句话，三个流氓离开了商店，沿着街道走去。

Shinji waited until he was certain that they had left the entire block, before he quickly stood up, walked over to the counter and swung his legs over the wooden surface.  
碇真嗣等到确信他们已经离开了整个街区，才迅速站起身，走到柜台前，双腿一跨，越过了木质表面。

Rebecca was sitting on the floor with her legs drawn up to her chest. She seemed to be crying silently, and Shinji was vaguely reminded of a similar experience with Asuka.  
丽贝卡坐在地上，双腿蜷缩至胸前。她似乎在无声地哭泣，这让真嗣隐约想起了与明日香类似的经历。

Kneeling down next to her, he muttered, "You okay?"  
他跪在她旁边，低声问道：“你还好吗？”

"No...I'm...Not," she managed to say through sobs.  
"不...我...不是，"她哽咽着勉强说道。

'Right,' thought Shinji, 'that was a given.'  
'没错，' 真嗣心想，'这是理所当然的。'

"Can I get you anything," he mumbled?  
"我能为你拿些什么吗，"他含糊地问道？

"The...white cloth, next to the coffee machine."  
“那...白色布巾，在咖啡机旁边。”

Standing up, Shinji spotted it immediately as it was the only white thing in the cafe and handed it to her.  
站起身来，真嗣立刻发现了它，因为它是咖啡店里唯一白色的东西，并把它递给了她。

Dabbing at the edges of her eyes with it, she looked up at Shinji. Her eyes were extremely puffy and red.  
她用布巾轻按眼角，抬头看向真嗣。她的眼睛异常红肿。

"I'm sorry you had to see that."  
"我很抱歉你不得不看到那一幕。"

"Its okay..." "没关系..."

She shook her head and said, "No, it really isn't. You're just a kid...and yet..."  
她摇了摇头说：“不，真的不是。你只是个孩子...然而...”

A twinge of annoyance hit Shinji at the word kid. Sure from someone her ages perspective he was a kid, but if she knew what he had done...well...  
听到“孩子”这个词，真嗣心中涌起一丝不悦。确实，从她的年龄来看，他是个孩子，但如果她知道他所做的一切...嗯...

"...And yet you stood up for me," she finished.  
“...而你却为我挺身而出，”她补充道。

Shinji's previous thought was banished at her words, and he was slightly abashed.  
听到她的话，真嗣之前的想法被抛到了九霄云外，他感到有些尴尬。

"I don't really think-" "我真的不觉得——"

"No, its because you were there that they didn't do anything."  
"不，正是因为你在那里，他们才没做什么。"

'Glad to help,' thought Shinji slightly disgruntled.  
“乐意效劳，”真嗣略带不满地想道。

"I'm Rebecca by the way...you?"  
"我叫丽贝卡，你呢？"

"Shinji." "真嗣。"

"Thank you, Shinji..." "谢谢你，真嗣..."

Shinji simply nodded and stood up. Walking over to the coffee machine, he examined it for a minute before deciding that he would rather have tea instead. Looking for a pot and tea leaves, Rebecca realize what he was doing and pointed out where everything was.  
真嗣只是点了点头，站起身来。他走到咖啡机前，仔细打量了一会儿，然后决定还是喝茶更好。他四处寻找茶壶和茶叶，丽贝卡意识到他在做什么，便指出了所有东西的位置。

After setting everything together, the two of them waited for the water to boil.  
一切准备就绪后，两人等待着水烧开。

"Why do you put up with it," Shinji suddenly asked her?  
“你为什么要忍受这些？”真嗣突然问她。

Rebecca was silent for a minute before she replied, "My mother has a rare disease that affects her mental capacity. She has the body of an adult, yet in essence she is a kid. She was born like that, but in recent years its become a lot worse. My father left us last year because he couldn't stand her anymore."  
丽贝卡沉默了一会儿才回答道：“我母亲患有一种罕见的疾病，影响她的心智能力。她拥有成年人的身体，本质上却像个孩子。她生来如此，但近年来情况变得更糟了。我父亲去年离开了我们，因为他再也忍受不了她了。”

"I'm sorry," Shinji muttered.  
“我很抱歉。”真嗣低声说道。

"Don't be...its not like you're to blame."  
“别这样……又不是你的错。”

"But why this? Why this if you hate it so much."  
"但为什么是这个？如果你这么讨厌它，为什么还要这样？"

"...Eein...is rude, disgusting, selfish, an arrogant bastard, and all around sleaze ball. But he is very rich, his father is the president of a petroleum company which deals with the United States. Because of his fathers reputation, he is able to get certain things done that other people wouldn't. He became fond of me a few years ago...when I was still developing, and heard about my mothers dilemma. He told me that if I worked for him, he'd provide the medical insurance to keep her alive and well. And so, I've become something of a slave I guess."  
"...Eein...他粗鲁、恶心、自私、傲慢无礼，是个彻头彻尾的混蛋。但他非常有钱，他父亲是一家与美国有业务往来的石油公司总裁。因为父亲的声望，他能办到别人办不到的事情。几年前，他开始对我感兴趣...那时我还在成长，也听说了我母亲的困境。他告诉我，如果我为他工作，他会提供医疗保险让她活下去并保持健康。于是，我想我成了某种意义上的奴隶。"

"Thats-" "这真是-"

"Cruel? Disgusting? Inhuman? I don't care, my mothers alive."  
"残忍？恶心？不人道？我不在乎，我妈妈还活着。"

"But what about you're life? What do you want to do with yourself? You cant live like this forever; what happens when he throws you away?"  
"但你的生活呢？你想怎么过？你不能永远这样生活下去；他抛弃你的时候怎么办？"

"I'll worry about it when the time comes," she mumbled, though she didn't seem very hopeful.  
"到时候我再担心，"她喃喃道，尽管她看起来并不抱太大希望。"

Shinji was silent for a second, and was thankfully give a reason to stand up as the water came to a boil. Placing the tea leaves in the pot, he waited till they dissolved, and poured two cups of herbal tea into two mugs.  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，幸好水开了，他有了站起来的理由。他将茶叶放入茶壶，等待它们溶解，然后将两杯草本茶倒入两个杯子中。

"Thanks," Rebecca said as Shinji passed the cup to her.  
“谢谢，”丽贝卡接过杯子时说道。

Sipping it quietly, Rebecca suddenly turned to Shinji and said, "I was wondering, but didn't bother asking. Do you go to school, or?"  
丽贝卡静静地啜饮着，突然转向真嗣问道：“我一直在想，但没好意思问。你是上学，还是？”

"...Normally yes, but I haven't gone for a week because of...certain circumstances."  
"...通常是的，但因为...某些情况，我已经一周没去了。"

"Would these circumstances have anything to do with the fact that you're in one of the most inhospitable parts of Tokyo-3?"  
"这些情况和你身处东京-3 最不宜居的地区有关系吗？"

"I was just sorta...walking and thinking and lost track of time.  
"我只是...边走边想，不知不觉就忘了时间。"

"This is probably the worst place to get lost in," she mumbled as she took another sip of tea.  
"这大概是迷路最糟糕的地方了，"她喃喃自语，又啜了一口茶。

"I can take care of myself."  
"我能照顾好自己。"

"I assume you can, considering what happened earlier."  
"我猜你行，毕竟之前发生的事儿。"

"Earlier?" "更早之前？"

"With Eein and the others...they almost seemed frightened of you."  
"和 Eein 他们一起...他们看起来几乎害怕你。"

"Can't imagine why," said Shinji while looking the other way.  
"难以想象为什么，" 真嗣说着，目光转向别处。

Rebecca looked at him shrewdly before saying, "Who are you exactly?"  
丽贝卡精明地看了他一眼，然后问道：“你到底是谁？”

Before Shinji was able to stop himself he replied, "I honestly don't know."  
在真嗣能阻止自己之前，他回答说：“我真的不知道。”

"Whats that supposed to mean?"  
“那是什么意思？”

"I...don't know why I exist, or what I'm supposed to do."  
"我...不知道我为什么存在，或者我应该做什么。"

"And this has something to do with those circumstances?"  
"这和那些情况有关吗？"

Shinji hesitated for a second before he nodded his head.  
真嗣犹豫了一会儿，然后点了点头。

Rebecca continued looking at him before she threw her arms behind her, and placed her hands palms down on the cold wooden surface of the floor.  
丽贝卡继续盯着他，随后将双臂向后一甩，手掌朝下放在冰冷的木地板上。

"Is it something that you can talk about?" She suddenly asked.  
“这件事你能谈吗？”她突然问道。

Shinji glanced at her out of the corner of his eye. Whatever she had seemed before Shinji started talking to her...well, she certainly wasn't stupid, not to mention rather attractive.  
真嗣用眼角瞥了她一眼。无论她之前给真嗣的印象如何……好吧，她显然不笨，更不用说还相当迷人。

Hesitating for a second, he finally replied, "I suppose its really not something...that the general public is supposed to be aware of."  
犹豫了一下，他最终回答道：“我想这确实不是……公众应该知道的事情。”

"Then I wouldn't bother you about it."  
“那我就不打扰你了。”

"No, I didn't mean to be rude. I just..." Shinji trailed off as he wasn't sure what he was getting at.  
“不，我不是有意无礼。我只是……” 真嗣话没说完，因为他也不确定自己到底想表达什么。

Rebecca continued looking at him, slightly curious, though not wanting pry, about what he was involved with.  
丽贝卡继续注视着他，略感好奇，尽管不想打探，但对他所涉及的事情产生了兴趣。

"You can tell me this much...does it have anything to do with a girl?"  
“你可以告诉我这一点……这和某个女孩有关吗？”

Shinji almost dropped his cup of tea, which was all the reply she needed.  
真嗣差点把手中的茶杯摔落，这个反应已经给了她足够的答案。

"So it does have something to do with a girl," replied Rebecca with a raised eyebrow.  
“所以这确实和某个女孩有关，”丽贝卡扬起眉毛回答道。

Turning towards her, Shinji stammered back, "No, not really...I-I mean, theres a girl involved...but she's not like...a center...problem, or anything."  
转向她，真嗣结结巴巴地反驳道：“不，不是真的……我的意思是，有个女孩牵扯其中……但她不像……中心……问题，或者别的什么。”

Rebecca suddenly smiled at Shinji's hopeless attempt at refuting how he had acted. The change in her appearance was dramatic, as her smile seemed to throw her entire face into a new light.  
丽贝卡突然对真嗣无力反驳自己行为的方式笑了。她的变化很戏剧性，笑容似乎让她的整张脸都焕发出新的光彩。

"So then whats the problem?"  
"那问题出在哪儿呢？"

"I...guess I'm just afraid."  
"我...我想我只是害怕。"

"Of what?" "怕什么？"

"Of being alone...of being unwanted."  
"孤独...不被需要的感觉。"

"Why is that?" “为什么？”

"Because...well, its hard since I just met you, to explain everything, but my childhood wasn't exactly endearing. I moved around a lot, lived with a lot of people. My father was making me do this, he abandoned me when I was young...like around four or something. I hated human contact, still find it difficult to associate with other people for that matter. But now I've become afraid of being useless, because I don't want my life to go back to what it was. I found a purpose in my life, but I don't know why I do what I do. I feel like I'm...living out other peoples dreams and wishes. Where are my desires? What reason do I have to live if all I'm doing is living for other people? I've been confined at a certain...place for a while, and managed to escape just a little while ago."  
"因为...嗯，毕竟我们刚认识，解释一切有点困难，但我的童年并不怎么令人怀念。我经常搬家，和很多人住在一起。我父亲让我做这些，他在我很小的时候就抛弃了我...大概四岁左右。我讨厌人际接触，至今仍觉得和别人打交道很困难。但现在我开始害怕变得无用，因为我不想回到过去的生活。我在生活中找到了目标，但我不知道自己为什么要这么做。我感觉自己...像是在实现别人的梦想和愿望。我的欲望在哪里？如果我只是在为别人而活，那我还有什么理由活下去？我曾被关在一个地方一段时间，不久前才设法逃出来。"

"Is the person on the card the one that helped you escape?"  
"卡片上的人是帮你逃脱的那位吗？"

"So you saw that?" replied Shinji trying not to sound sheepish.  
"所以你看到了？" 真嗣回答，尽量不显得尴尬。

"Yeah, I just didn't really care at the time."  
"是啊，我当时真的不太在意。"

"The only way I could escape was if I had that card. I had to go through some security check points, and without it...well."  
"我唯一能逃脱的方法就是用那张卡。我得通过一些安检点，没有它的话...嗯。"

"And its also a debit card?"  
"而且它也是借记卡？"

"...Yeah..." "……嗯……"

"Sounds to me like you got yourself into some pretty bad shit."  
"听起来你似乎惹上了些大麻烦。"

'If you only new the half of it,' thought Shinji.  
“如果你只了解其中的一半，”真嗣心想。

"So, what are you going to do now? Go back?"  
“那么，你现在打算怎么办？回去吗？”

"I knew from the minute I left that I'd have to come back, at least eventually, because I couldn't just abandon everybody after everything we've been through."  
“我从离开的那一刻起就知道，我终究得回来，至少是迟早的事，因为我不能就这样在我们经历了那么多之后抛弃大家。”

"And yet you still don't know what to do?"  
"然而你还是不知道该怎么做？"

"...Right..." "...没错..."

Rebecca sat up suddenly and reached for something in her jean pocket. Pulling out a lighter and a pack of cigarettes, she put a cigarette in her mouth and was about to light it when she caught the sideways glance from Shinji.  
丽贝卡突然坐起身，伸手去掏牛仔裤口袋里的东西。她掏出一个打火机和一包香烟，将一支烟叼在嘴里，正要点燃时，注意到了真嗣斜眼的一瞥。

"Sorry," she replied after realizing that his expression was one of annoyance. "Its a bad habit, and I know it is."  
"对不起，"她意识到他的表情带着恼怒后回答道，"这是个坏习惯，我知道。"

"Its fine, I know somebody that smokes at least two packs a day."  
"没关系，我认识一个人，每天至少抽两包烟。"

"Now thats murder," replied Rebecca with a slight chuckle.  
"那可真是要命，"丽贝卡轻声笑道。"

Silence passed between them again until Rebecca said, "And I thought that my life had problems."  
沉默再次在他们之间蔓延，直到丽贝卡说道：“我还以为我的生活已经够麻烦了。”

"Huh?" “啊？”

"Look...Shinji. I don't mean to know much about life and what not, but I can tell that you have stuff going on in your life that no fourteen year should have to bear."  
“听着……真嗣。我并不想过多了解生活之类的事，但我能看出你生活中有些事情是一个十四岁的孩子不该承受的。”

"I'm fifteen..." “我十五岁了……”

"Big difference. Anyway...I believe that each person was put on this planet for a reason, and while I haven't figured out my reason, I still believe that. As for you...when all else fails, follow what your heart says."  
"天壤之别。不过...我相信每个人来到这个世界上都有其原因，虽然我还没找到自己的原因，但我依然坚信这一点。至于你...当一切方法都行不通时，就听从你的心声吧。"

"My heart?" "我的心？"

"Yeah, its usually more correct then the brain at least. And for...well, whatever you do, maybe its okay to not have a legitimate reason. Its what you feel at the time thats important after all. Are you protecting somebody?"  
"是的，至少它通常比大脑更正确。而且...无论你做什么，或许没有正当理由也没关系。毕竟，重要的是你当时的感受。你在保护某个人吗？"

'If you knew that I was protecting you and all the citizens of Tokyo-3 what would you say?' wondered Shinji.  
'如果你知道我是在保护你和所有第三新东京市的市民，你会怎么想？' 真嗣思索着。

"Yeah, I'm protecting people."  
“是啊，我在保护人们。”

"Then isn't it enough to know that you prevented there deaths from happening?"  
“那么，知道你阻止了他们的死亡，这还不够吗？”

"But its not like that...its different...but I can't explain it without telling you everything."  
"但事情不是那样的...这是不同的...但如果我不告诉你一切，就无法解释清楚。"

"Then why not just tell me? You certainly seem like you need someone to talk to."  
"那为什么不直接告诉我呢？你看起来确实需要有人倾诉。"

Should he? Should he really tell a total stranger that he's barely known for twenty minutes the inner working of Nerv? He could almost hear Misato's voice as it yelled at him in his head.  
他应该吗？他真的应该告诉一个只认识了二十分钟的完全陌生的人关于 NERV 的内部运作吗？他几乎能听到美里在他脑海中对他大喊的声音。

"I really shoul-" "我真的应-"

Shinji was suddenly cut off as something that sounded like twenty fire truck sirens exploded into the open air. Sending him down onto all fours, he covered his ears up and tried to cut out the sudden wailing. Next to him, it seemed that Rebecca was doing likewise, though she seemed to understand what it was.  
真嗣话音未落，一阵如同二十辆消防车警笛齐鸣的巨响突然在空气中炸开。他被震得四肢着地，双手捂住耳朵，试图隔绝这突如其来的哀嚎。在他身旁，丽贝卡似乎也在做着同样的事情，但她似乎明白这是什么。

As the wailing subsided, and the ringing in Shinji's ears dissipated, Shinji saw Rebecca hurry to her feet and starting cursing suddenly.  
随着哀嚎声减弱，真嗣耳中的轰鸣逐渐消散，他看到丽贝卡急忙站起身来，突然开始咒骂起来。

"God damn it! Why the fuck is the damn siren directly above this fucking shop."  
"该死！这该死的警报器怎么就正好在这家破店上面。"

"What was tha-" Shinji started asking, though she cut him off.  
""这是怎么——"" 真嗣刚开口，就被她打断了。

"Its the evacuation siren. Surely you've experienced this before? God knows they've been opening up the shelters enough recently."  
"这是疏散警报。你肯定之前经历过吧？天知道他们最近开了多少次避难所。"

"Shelters...what?" "避难所...什么？"

"Come on! We've gotta move to the nearest one."  
"快点！我们得去最近的那个。"

"But I..." "但我..."

'Angel attack,' his mind suddenly whispered to him.  
“天使来袭，”他的脑海中突然响起这个声音。

It had to be, there was no other explanation, and without him, they were short one extra pilot.  
一定是这样，没有其他解释了，而且没有他，他们就少了一个额外的驾驶员。

'Then what should I do?' he asked himself. 'Ignore it? Continue on and act as though everything was perfectly fine. Abandoned everybody that he had come to know?'  
“那我该怎么办？”他自问。“无视它？继续前进，装作一切正常。抛弃所有他认识的人？”

Shinji, who had just stepped outside the small shop and onto the pavement suddenly stop dead in his tracks and jerked Rebecca's hand, which had been holding onto his wrist.  
刚刚从小店出来踏上人行道的真嗣突然停住了脚步，猛地拽了一下正抓着他手腕的丽贝卡的手。

"Shinji wha-" “真嗣，怎——”

Rebecca gasped as she felt Shinji's arm suddenly go slack in her grasp, and next second his legs gave out from under him, as he fell forwards into her chest.  
丽贝卡倒吸一口凉气，感觉到真嗣的手臂在她手中突然松软下来，紧接着他的双腿一软，向前倒在了她的胸前。

"Shin-" "真-

Shinji's eyes flew open as he let out a blood curdling scream. Like a tree struck by lightning, his head suddenly felt as though it had been cloven in two and was on fire. Grabbing the spot where the temples where located on either side of his head, he staggered backwards out of Rebecca's chest, and slammed the back of his head into the brick wall of the cafe. A small stream of blood started flowing behind his head now, and some be seen congealing in his eyebrows.  
真嗣的眼睛猛地睁开，发出一声撕心裂肺的尖叫。仿佛被雷击中的树一般，他的头突然感到像是被劈成了两半，并且着了火。他双手紧抓着头部两侧的太阳穴位置，踉跄地从丽贝卡的胸前退了出来，后脑勺重重地撞在了咖啡馆的砖墙上。一股细小的血流开始从他脑后流出，有些血迹凝结在他的眉毛上。

Why now? Why did it have to happen now of all times? But really, he should have expected that. They always came when something he was doing affected the lives of somebody greatly.  
为什么是现在？为什么偏偏是这个时候发生？但实际上，他早该预料到的。每当他做的事情对某人的生活产生重大影响时，这些事情总会找上门来。

A vision struck Shinji so greatly that he had blacked out momentarily, his eyes glazing over. In that short time span of him being unconscious, it felt as though he had seen enough horrible things to right a book on them, when really, in reality, it had lasted no longer then a second.  
一个强烈的幻象击中了真嗣，让他短暂地失去了意识，双眼变得呆滞。在那短暂的失去意识的时间里，他感觉自己仿佛看到了足够写一本书的可怕事物，而实际上，这一切只持续了不到一秒钟。

Tokyo-3 as he had known it, was no more. A giant crater instead stood where Tokyo-3 had once stood, a crater that no meteorite could have caused. Some buildings from the remains of Tokyo-3 lay scattered around the land scape, as though a small infant had picked them up, only to discard them later as it found a new toy. The Sea of Tokyo had filled the vast majority of the large crater, except that it no longer supported any form of marine wildlife; the sea had turned a blood red.  
他所熟知的东京-3 已不复存在。取而代之的是一个巨大的陨石坑，绝非陨石撞击所能形成。东京-3 的残骸中，有些建筑散落在地貌各处，仿佛一个幼童将它们拾起，又在新玩具的诱惑下随意丢弃。东京湾的海水填满了大部分巨坑，只是这片海域已不再孕育任何海洋生物；海水变成了血红色。

Shinji then felt himself being pulled violently backwards as he witnessed the cause of everything. It had been an angel that descended on them, the likes of which they had never fought before. The AT-field was impossible to penetrate.  
随后，真嗣感到自己被猛地向后拽去，他目睹了一切灾难的源头。那是一个天使降临在他们面前，是他们从未遭遇过的强大存在。其 AT 力场坚不可摧。

Shinji watched as Misato gave the order for the deployment of all the Eva's, though in truth it was only one. The dummy plug was inserted into units 01 and 02, though to no avail. Shinji couldn't understand why unit 02 hadn't responded to the signal though. Eventually Commander Ikari gave the order for Rei's deployment with Asuka backing her up, though it seemed that Misato had to refute that. Even though she was speaking against the Commander, her voice seemed unusually strong, as though she had finally come to terms with something. She told the Commander that under no circumstances was Asuka able to pilot. Even Ritsuko backed up her statement with a brief summary of Asuka's mental health and it clearly stated that any contact with an Evangelion would surely send her into a coma. Eventually Rei was forced to deploy by herself and stall while they searched for Shinji. That had been particularly hard to watch, as the Shinji from this vision had long since died off, figuratively speaking of course.  
真嗣注视着美里下达所有 Eva 出击的命令，尽管实际上只有一台。模拟插入栓被插入 01 和 02 号机，却毫无效果。真嗣不解为何 02 号机未响应信号。最终，碇司令命令丽出击，由明日香支援，但美里似乎不得不反驳这一决定。尽管她在反对司令，语气却异常坚定，仿佛终于接受了某事。她告诉司令，无论如何明日香都无法驾驶 Eva。甚至连律子也简述了明日香的心理状况来支持她的说法，明确指出任何与 Eva 的接触都必将使她陷入昏迷。最终，丽被迫独自出击拖延时间，同时他们寻找真嗣。这一幕尤为难以目睹，因为从这个视角来看，真嗣早已在精神上消逝，当然，这只是比喻。

Rei deployed, and attempted to destroy the angels AT-field, but it had all but proved immune to all attacks. Eventually, she was forced to detonated an N2 bomb point blank in the angels face, but that had proved to do more harm than good, as much of the armor plating of 00 was melted off in the ensuing explosion.  
零号机展开了攻击，试图摧毁使徒的 AT 力场，但几乎所有攻击都对其无效。最终，她被迫在使徒的脸上引爆了一枚 N2 炸弹，但这反而造成了更大的伤害，因为爆炸中零号机的装甲板大部分都被熔化了。

The angel completely ignored Rei and Unit 00 after this and proceeded to destroy most of the armor plating layers that separated Tokyo-3 from the Geofront. Doing this last part exceptionally well, it slowly descended into the narrow hole that it had opened up in the Geofront. Breaking into Central Dogma was now all but too easy, as the minor defenses that Nerv had implemented had never been strong enough to combat an angel. In a last ditch effort to destroy the angel, Commander Ikari had given the JSDF authorization to drop several N2 bombs inside the Geofront. The N2 bombs barely even fazed the angel, since the AT-field completely protected it from any outside harm.  
使徒完全无视了零和零号机，继续摧毁了大部分分隔东京-3 与地底都市的装甲层。它做得非常出色，缓缓降入自己在地底都市打开的狭窄洞口。突破中央教条现在变得异常容易，因为 NERV 部署的那些防御措施从未强大到足以对抗使徒。在最后的努力中，碇司令授权自卫队在地底都市内投下几枚 N2 炸弹。然而，N2 炸弹几乎对使徒毫无影响，因为 AT 力场完全保护了它免受任何外部伤害。

What was probably the hardest part of Shinji however was when he witnessed what happened to Asuka. Misato had given authorization to move Asuka out of the medical facilities and move her into one of the underground bunkers that littered the landscape of the Geofront. If only she had realized the gravity of her decision.  
然而，对真嗣来说最艰难的部分，莫过于他目睹了明日香所遭遇的一切。美里批准将明日香从医疗设施中转移出来，安置到地表下遍布的地下掩体之一。如果她当时能意识到这一决定的严重性就好了。

This had been different then Shinji's previous dreams about Asuka, in the sense that this was more gruesome, if that was even physically possible. The hardest part, was that Asuka had been awake and conscious throughout it all, able to feel the pain as her body was ripped apart, and Shinji was able to feel the pain that she had felt.  
这与真嗣之前关于明日香的梦境截然不同，这一次更加惨烈，如果这从物理上讲还有可能的话。最痛苦的是，明日香在整个过程中都是清醒的，能感受到身体被撕裂的痛楚，而真嗣也感同身受地体会到了她的痛苦。

The underground bunker that she had been moved to, was little more than a small room surround by metal, and in hind site, the metal box that she was incased in produced the hurt and tragedy.  
她被转移到的地下掩体，不过是一个被金属包围的小房间，事后看来，这个金属囚笼加剧了她的痛苦与悲剧。

When the angel descended, it continued firing off its AT-field, ripping apart the ground beneath it as though it were splitting the Red Sea, except this gouge in the Earth stayed like that. The pieces of earth that had been ripped apart were flung through the air like a rag dog, tearing trees and small buildings that housed some residents of the Geofront. Part of the earth that the angel had ripped apart, housed the bunker that Asuka was being kept in.  
当使徒降临之时，它持续释放着 AT 力场，撕裂着脚下的地面，仿佛在分隔红海，只不过这道地球上的裂痕就此永久留存。被撕裂的土块如同破布狗一般被抛向空中，摧毁了树木和一些居民居住的小型建筑。使徒撕裂的地面部分，正是关押着明日香的地堡所在。

The bunker was completely sheared in two, leaving a gaping hole in the roof. Twisted pieces of metal lay scattered across the floor, and one piece in particular piqued his attention.  
地堡被完全切成了两半，屋顶留下了一个巨大的缺口。扭曲的金属碎片散落一地，其中一块特别引起了他的注意。

Asuka's right arm had been penetrated straight through by the chunk of metal, splintering the bone in the process. Blood boiled to the surface and leaked over the side of the arm and started dripping onto the floor. Asuka let out a loud moan of despair as the pain suddenly hit her like a ton of bricks. Attempting to amend the pain, she grasped the end of the metal stake with her left, clenched her teeth, and pulled as hard as her frail body would allow her. She only succeeded in causing herself more pain.  
明日香的右臂被金属块直接贯穿，过程中骨头也碎裂了。血液沸腾着涌向表面，沿着手臂一侧流淌，滴落到地板上。明日香发出一声绝望的呻吟，疼痛突然如同一吨重的砖块般袭来。她试图缓解疼痛，用左手抓住金属桩的末端，紧咬牙关，用她虚弱的身体所能承受的最大力量拉扯。结果只是让自己更加痛苦。

Her vision started to grow foggy from the blood loss, and finally she stood up and attempted to wrench the door open that would grant her freedom. However, it wouldn't budge. Behind the door, the opposite wall and the roof above had caved in and crumbled, creating an affective barrier against her freedom.  
她的视线因失血开始变得模糊，最终她站起身来，试图用力拉开那扇能赋予她自由的门。然而，门却纹丝不动。门后，对面的墙壁和屋顶已经坍塌崩裂，形成了一道有效的屏障，阻挡了她的自由之路。

Staggering backwards, she turned around and pressed her back against the cold metal door and said in a quite voice that seemed devoid of life, "Is anyone...there? Someone...please! Help!"  
她踉跄后退，转过身来，将背紧贴在冰冷的金属门上，用一种似乎毫无生气的平静声音说道：“有人吗...那里？有人...请帮帮我！”

Shinji felt completely helpless as he watched Asuka scratch her finger nails against the metal door. The sounds that echoed off the metal walls sounded like a banshee's screech.  
看着明日香用指甲刮擦金属门的情景，真嗣感到彻底的无助。那声音在金属墙壁间回荡，听起来就像女妖的尖叫。

Eventually, Asuka slid down the metal door and rested at the bottom of it with her left hand wrapped around the twisted piece of metal that was perturbing out of her arm. Giving an almighty wrench, she attempted to pull it out again, but this time managed to split the palm of her hand open, created a new stream of blood. Soon the floor beneath was covered in bright red fluid, as her body's life force was slowly drained away.  
最终，明日香顺着金属门滑下，坐在底部，左臂上扭曲的金属片刺穿皮肤，她用左手紧紧抓住它。她使出全力试图再次拔出，却意外地撕裂了手掌，鲜血如新涌的溪流般流淌。很快，地板被鲜红的液体覆盖，她的生命力正逐渐流失。

Shinji attempted to turn away from the horrific scene, by he found that his body was simply refusing to obey him, almost as though a supernatural force was rooting him to the stop, forcing him to watch the outcome of a possible decision of his.  
真嗣试图转过身去，避开这恐怖的场景，但他发现自己的身体根本不听使唤，仿佛有一股超自然的力量将他牢牢固定在原地，迫使他目睹自己可能选择的结果。

With an almighty explosion, Shinji saw a brief flash of orange that he was barely able to pick up as the angel ripped apart the earth again, this time sending up a large cloud of dust into the air. Gazing at the angel momentarily, he saw that what was considered its head had two sunken, gleaming red eyes, peering out of the skull. Next second, another explosion of brilliant orange light flashed outward from the angel, though this time Shinji could have sworn he saw it shoot out of its eyes, as though it was some sort of laser.  
随着一声震耳欲聋的爆炸，真嗣瞥见了一抹橙光，那是天使再次撕裂大地时他勉强捕捉到的景象，这一次扬起了一大片尘土。他短暂地凝视着天使，发现被视为其头部的位置有两只深陷的、闪着红光的眼睛，从颅骨中窥视着外界。紧接着，又一道耀眼的橙色光芒从天使身上爆发出来，但这次真嗣敢肯定，那光芒仿佛是从它的眼睛中射出的，就像某种激光一样。

Tearing his gaze away from the angel, he looked back to the spot where Asuka had been, only to be surprised that she had vacated her spot, and was slowly plodding towards the new gaping hole in the wall that the angel had created with the second explosion. Asuka seemed to be on the verge of collapsing, as her body's functions started to break down, and it was all she could do to force herself to keep moving. At this point, Shinji had attempted to reach out in his mind to her, determined that because it was her, and because of him possessing angel powers, that he would be able to call out to her. No such thing happened of course, since in all aspects, the Shinji thats decision had led to this scenario, was no longer even present. He had simply dropped out of reality. He had forsaken Asuka because of his own fears, and in doing so, had tossed away the relationship they once had.  
他强迫自己从天使身上移开视线，回头望向明日香所在的地方，却惊讶地发现她已经离开了原位，正缓缓向天使用第二次爆炸制造的新墙洞走去。明日香似乎快要支撑不住了，身体机能开始崩溃，她所能做的只是强迫自己继续前行。此时，真嗣试图在心中向她伸出援手，坚信因为她是明日香，也因为自己拥有天使之力，他能够呼唤她。当然，这一切并未发生，因为导致这一局面的真嗣已经不复存在，他彻底脱离了现实。他因自己的恐惧而抛弃了明日香，也因此断送了他们曾经的关系。

As Asuka continued crawling towards her objective, Shinji saw it a split second before it happened, and in what was possibly a last attempt to communicate with her, reached his hand out towards her.  
当明日香继续向目标爬行时，真嗣在事情发生前一瞬间看到了，可能是最后一次试图与她沟通，他向她伸出了手。

A metal beam directly above where Asuka was crawling suddenly snapped in two, as the bolts holding it in place could no longer contain the strain. The beam pierced her back and sheared through the flesh as it ripped apart her internal organs, before exiting through the other side, forcing her ribs to pop out through her white skin. The beam struck the concrete flooring with a loud 'clang,' as it chipped away some of the flooring, scattering pebbles everywhere. Blood gushed out of her open wound and flowed down the metal beam and onto the floor in a puddle. Likewise, blood surged up her throat before she vomited, pushing stomach bile mixed with blood out of her mouth, which slid down her chin and would eventually cake onto her face.  
一根金属横梁正好悬在明日香爬行的地方，突然断裂成两截，固定它的螺栓再也无法承受压力。横梁刺穿她的背部，撕裂了内脏，然后从另一侧穿出，迫使她的肋骨刺破白皙的皮肤。横梁重重地砸在混凝土地板上，发出响亮的‘哐当’声，砸碎了一些地板，石子四散飞溅。鲜血从她敞开的伤口中涌出，顺着金属横梁流下，在地板上形成一滩血泊。同样，血液涌上她的喉咙，她随即呕吐，将混合着血液的胃液从口中喷出，顺着下巴滑落，最终凝结在她的脸上。

The only thing that could be thankfully said, was that she felt very little pain, as the beam had ripped apart the right ventricle of her heart and the aorta, killing her within seconds.  
唯一值得庆幸的是，她几乎感觉不到疼痛，因为横梁已经撕裂了她心脏的右心室和主动脉，使她在几秒钟内丧命。

Without having a second to think about what had happened any clear than what he was currently watching, Shinji suddenly felt his entire body being jerked backwards as though an invisible hook grabbed the back of his shirt.  
还没来得及清晰地思考刚刚发生的一切，真嗣突然感到整个身体被猛地向后拽，仿佛有一只无形钩子抓住了他衬衫的后背。

Darkness engulfed him and it felt as though he was being propelled down a dark tunnel with no end in sight. With the sleeve of his shirt flapping in the wind and his eyes starting to water from the shear speed he was falling at, Shinji suddenly felt himself hit the surface of something, and next second noticed that his body suddenly felt much heavier as the clothes he was wearing became soaked as they absorbed the large body of blood red water that he had fallen in.  
黑暗吞噬了他，感觉就像是被推进了一条没有尽头的黑暗隧道。随着衬衫袖子在风中飘动，眼睛因极速下坠而开始流泪，真嗣突然感到自己撞上了某个表面，下一秒就注意到身体突然变得沉重，身上的衣服因吸收了大量的血红色水体而湿透。

Attempting to claw his way to the surface where sweet fresh air awaited him, he suddenly noticed another presence with him in the watery depths. Turning towards this new presence, he suddenly found himself facing a mirror in all this blackness. Though instead of his own reflection looking back at him, he saw-  
他试图挣扎着游向水面，那里有清新的空气在等待着他，却突然察觉到水中还有另一个存在。转向这个新出现的存在，他在这一片漆黑中突然发现自己面对着一面镜子。然而，映照回来的并非他自己的倒影，而是——

"Disgusting isn't it, what one small choice can do," replied the pseudo Asuka.  
“真是令人作呕，不是吗？一个小小的选择能带来什么后果，”假扮的明日香回答道。

"Stop it!" Shinji yelled "住手！" 真嗣大喊

"Why should I? You don't seem to get it. You don't seem to get the fact what your decisions can lead to. Think of it this way, you are standing on a path, and this path can lead to multiple directions. Within these multiple directions are other directions, and thousands like it. From the very moment you stepped into her world, you have slowly been leading down a path of destruction. You cannot turn away from what awaits you."  
"我为什么要住手？你似乎不明白。你不明白你的决定可能导致的后果。这么想吧，你站在一条岔路上，这条路可以通向多个方向。在这些多个方向中，还有其他方向，以及成千上万个类似的方向。从你踏入她的世界的那一刻起，你就慢慢走上了一条毁灭之路。你无法逃避即将到来的命运。"

"This isn't it!" "这不是终点！"

"No, it may not be, but something like it is a possibility in the all too distant future. How many angels are left including this one...three...four?"  
"不，或许不会，但在遥不可及的未来，类似的情况是有可能发生的。包括这位在内，还剩下多少天使...三个...四个？"

"I'm human, as human I make wrong decisions."  
"我是人，正因如此，我会做出错误的决定。"

"But you don't change, and you never will! You keep thinking the same pathetic things. 'Don't hurt me. Don't abandon me. Make me exist. Hold me! Love me!' Such petty human things disgust me so much that I almost wish that you had died long before it ever came to this. But things have, so deal with your problems and stopped winning and complaining to other people about your problems. What does it take for you to realize it? Do I have to rip apart the flesh of somebody near to you? Should I take the form of a human dear to you and rip apart your heart from within?"  
"但你从未改变，也永远不会改变！你总是想着那些可悲的事情。‘别伤害我。别抛弃我。让我存在。抱紧我！爱我！’这些卑微的人类情感让我如此厌恶，以至于我几乎希望你早在这一切发生之前就死去。但既然事情已经发生了，就处理好你的问题，停止抱怨并向他人诉苦。你到底要怎样才能明白？难道我非得撕裂某个亲近之人的血肉吗？我是否应该化作你珍视的人类模样，从内部撕碎你的心？"

The mirror in front of him suddenly changed and Shinji's own reflection was suddenly looked back at him, except this Shinji was different. This Shinji had blood red eyes, and a killing intent that forced people to scatter at his very presence. Behind him lay a torrent of fire and death. Before him lay a skinny boy no more then fifteen who was seeing his other self. His angel self.  
他面前的镜子突然发生了变化，真嗣自己的倒影突然回望着他，只不过这个真嗣有所不同。这个真嗣有着血红色的眼睛，以及一种令人望而生畏的杀意。他身后是一片火海与死亡。在他面前，站着一个瘦弱的男孩，不超过十五岁，正凝视着自己的另一个自我。他的天使自我。

"I'm...an angel?" “我……是天使吗？”

"No," replied the entity that stood in front of him. "You are not, but you have angel blood flowing through you, as well as your DNA structure which consists of extra chromosomes."  
“不，”站在他面前的存在回答道，“你不是，但你体内流淌着天使之血，你的 DNA 结构也包含了额外的染色体。”

"How did this happen?" "这是怎么发生的？"

"I can't say, for you are not ready to know. Do not make the same mistake that I made."  
"我不能说，因为你还未准备好知道。不要重蹈我的覆辙。"

"...What mistake?" "...什么错误？"

"I followed a different path then the one you followed...it led to this ending."  
"我选择了与你不同的道路……它导致了这样的结局。"

Shinji suddenly found himself witnessing the aftermath of the battle with the angel Zeruel. Death and devastation lay everywhere, bodies where flung left and right, large buildings where toppled, dried blood lay caked on the roads and streets.  
真嗣突然发现自己目睹了与天使 Zeruel 战斗后的惨状。死亡与毁灭无处不在，尸体四处散落，巨大的建筑物被推倒，干涸的血迹凝固在道路和街道上。

"What...happened?" "发生了……什么？"

"I abandoned my human half and completely absorbed the angel part of me. Every human became my enemy...I purged the entire planet of all humans using Evangelion Unit 01 and my powers. Soon the angels will refurbish the Earth and start another rebuilding..."  
"我舍弃了人性，完全融入了天使的部分。所有人类都成了我的敌人……我利用 EVA 初号机和我的力量，将地球上的人类全部清除。不久，天使们将重塑地球，开始新一轮的重建……"

"Another rebuilding?" "新一轮的重建？"

"It is a cycle that has gone on for billions of years. The angels are nothing more then energy beings, and they constantly expel energy in order to create life, life force if you will. At least the majority of them do. The flesh that you see is simply to give them a definable shape.  
"这是一个已经持续了数十亿年的循环。天使不过是能量体，他们不断释放能量以创造生命，或者说生命力。至少大多数天使是这样。你所看到的肉体，只是为了给他们一个可辨识的形态。"

"Adam and Lilith are special. They alone created humans. Adam hallowed your bodies and created the limbs and bodily functions that you take for granted. Lilith created your souls, and in doing so, who you are as a person. The other angels create life as they see fit. Some are in charge of plants, while others are in charge of animals. Even the very air that you breath was created by us. The Earth had been polluted by humans, or the Lilim if you prefer. They were an experiment, nothing more, but Adam and Lilith saw that they were flawed. They became greedy of what they saw around them and wanted more. They built large factories which expelled great amounts of carbon monoxide and other poisons. The rivers, the lakes, the oceans, look everywhere and you will see the decay of things."  
亚当和莉莉丝是特别的。他们独自创造了人类。亚当赋予了你们身体，创造了你们视为理所当然的四肢和生理功能。莉莉丝创造了你们的灵魂，也因此塑造了你们作为人的本质。其他天使按照他们的意愿创造生命。有些负责植物，有些负责动物。甚至你们呼吸的空气也是我们创造的。地球曾被人类，或者说莉莉姆污染。他们只是一个实验，仅此而已，但亚当和莉莉丝看到了他们的缺陷。他们变得贪婪，渴望更多。他们建造了大型工厂，排放大量一氧化碳和其他有毒物质。河流、湖泊、海洋，四处看看，你会看到事物的腐朽。

Shinji was speechless as his other self continued its rant.  
真嗣无言以对，他的另一个自我继续发泄着不满。

"I abandoned my human self, and became the non-existent nineteenth angel, which never should have been. I killed everyone and everything and have ushered in a new beginning, but I am still you. No matter how much I despise who I am or who you are as a person, I am still Shinji Ikari, and that wont change. Do not do what I did. You are not ready for the truth of who you are. It will drive you crazy, insane, and you'll kill everyone you hold dear. Even as I killed them I did not feel anything, and yet my eyes still cried. I pulled apart there bodies with the greatest ease and not once did I feel as though what I was doing was wrong. I think I might have even laughed at one point while I killed everyone."  
"我抛弃了人类的自我，化身为本不应存在的第十九使徒。我屠戮了所有人事物，迎来了一个新的开始，但我依然是你。无论我多么憎恶自己或你作为人的本质，我依旧是碇真嗣，这一点不会改变。不要重蹈我的覆辙。你还未准备好面对真实的自我。那真相会让你疯狂，让你崩溃，你会杀害所有珍视的人。即便我杀了他们，内心却毫无波澜，然而我的双眼仍在流泪。我轻易地撕裂他们的身体，从未感到自己所做的是错误的。甚至在那一刻，我或许还笑了出来。"

"You are not me," Shinji suddenly said.  
"你不是我，" 真嗣突然说道。"

"Yes I am! I am the you that diverged on a different path. I am the you that tore Misato's head off with my own hands! I am the you that killed his own father and then bathed in his blood. I am the you that gouged Rei's eyes off and disemboweled her. I am the you that cut Asuka's arms and legs off and proceeded to rape her-"  
"是的，我就是你！我是那个走上不同道路的你。我是那个亲手扯下美里头颅的你！我是那个弑父并沐浴其血的你。我是那个挖出绫波双眼并将其开膛破肚的你。我是那个砍断明日香四肢并强暴她的你——"

Shinji suddenly punched the mirror in front of him with all his might. His fist went straight through it as though it had never been there, and from Shinji's perspective it hadn't. It had simply disappeared as though it had been a mirage underwater.  
真嗣突然用尽全力向面前的镜子挥拳。他的拳头径直穿透了镜子，仿佛它从未存在过，从真嗣的角度看，它确实不存在。它就像水下的海市蜃楼一样，简单地消失了。

"I am not you," Shinji repeated. "I will never be you. You may look and sound like me, but you aren't. I would sooner kill myself then do that to my friends."  
"我不是你，"真嗣重复道，"我永远不会成为你。你可能看起来和听起来都像我，但你不是我。我宁愿自杀，也不会那样对待我的朋友。"

"Maybe you aren't so weak after all."  
"也许你并没有那么软弱。"

Shinji spun around under the water and turned to face the pseudo Asuka.  
真嗣在水下旋转了一圈，转身面对那个伪装的明日香。

"Did you do that?" “是你做的吗？”

"No...I didn't. That was the subconscious part of your mind trying to draw out your angel self. Quite frankly I thought you would have relented and become the nineteenth angel. As I said, you are stronger than I thought."  
“不……我没有。那是你潜意识中试图唤醒你天使自我的一部分。坦白说，我以为你会屈服并成为第十九使徒。正如我所说，你比我想象的要坚强。”

"Is what he said true...about the choices he made."  
"他说的那些关于选择的话...是真的吗？"

"Yes, it is very true. For you, as a human, decisions are everything. What you decide to do when you wake up in the morning may be crucial to what you will do later in the day. The same concept applies here."  
"是的，非常真实。作为人类，决定一切。你早上醒来时做出的决定可能对你当天晚些时候要做的事情至关重要。这个概念在这里同样适用。"

Shinji looked at the thing that resembled Asuka exactly and finally said, "I know I've asked this roughly a hundred times by now...but who are you?"  
真嗣看着那个与明日香一模一样的东西，终于说道：“我知道这个问题我已经问了大概一百遍了...但你是谁？”

The pseudo Asuka sighed and said, "You wont know till the end, if you make it there."  
伪明日香叹了口气，说道：“不到最后，你不会知道结果，如果你能走到那一步的话。”

"And what is at the end of everything?"  
“那么，一切的尽头是什么呢？”

The pseudo Asuka smiled slightly and said, "The Tree Of Life."  
伪明日香微微一笑，说道：“生命之树。”

"And what exactly is that?"  
"那究竟是什么？"

"You'll know eventually."  
"你迟早会知道的。"

"Big help...but thanks anyway."  
"真是个大帮助……不过还是谢谢了。"

"The pseudo Asuka seemed rather taken aback and to Shinji, it seemed as though the human it was impersonating let through some very real Asuka like emotions for a moment before she said, "Why the thanks?"  
"伪装的明日香似乎相当吃惊，对真嗣来说，那仿冒者仿佛在那一刻流露出了真正的明日香般的情感，随后她问道：“为什么要谢我？”

"You helped me...sort a few things out, though in a rather disgusting way."  
"你帮我...理清了一些事情，虽然方式相当令人作呕。"

"Fear works best on you humans, and particularly when it governs that girl that your mind wanders over."  
"恐惧对你们人类最为有效，尤其是当它掌控着那个你心中所思的女孩时。"

"I wont be able to sleep thanks to this for a week."  
"因为这事儿，我一周都别想睡个好觉了。"

"Like you were getting much to begin with locked up in the white room anyway."  
"反正你被关在白房间里也没怎么睡过。"

"...Then this is it?" "...那么，这就是结局了吗？"

"...Yes it is, and it will be, for I shall not interfere with this anymore. Though I have one last thing I must ask."  
"...是的，确实如此，而且将会如此，因为我不会再干预这一切。不过，我还有最后一件事必须问。"

"Whats that?" "什么事？"

"Do you understand what your power is, for that is essential for everything that comes after this."  
"你明白你的力量是什么吗？这是接下来一切的关键。"

Shinji stood gazing at the pseudo Asuka for a minute before saying, "If the angels are energy beings, and are able to create and manipulate things, there is one thing that they can't manipulate that humans can..."  
真嗣站在那里凝视着假明日香，过了一会儿才说道：“如果使徒是能量生命体，能够创造和操纵事物，那么有一样东西是他们无法操纵的，而人类却可以……”

"And that is?" “那是什么？”

"Time," said Shinji simply.  
“时间，”真嗣简单地回答道。

The pseudo Asuka continued looking at him for a minute before saying, "Well its close enough for now. You'll learn more about it in time since you've theoretically awakened with the existence of your AT-field. For all intended purposes I suppose you are correct. Humans can control there own time by their decisions. Since you are both human and angel you can govern yours and other peoples time. But only humans, and those close or dear to you."  
伪明日香继续盯着他看了一会儿，然后说道：“好吧，现在这样已经足够接近了。随着你理论上因 AT 力场的存在而觉醒，你会逐渐了解更多。就目前的目的而言，我想你是对的。人类可以通过自己的决定来控制时间。既然你既是人类又是天使，你就能掌控你和他人的时间。但仅限于人类，以及那些与你亲近或重要的人。”

"I got it...I think." “我明白了...大概。”

"I really wonder about that," sighed the pseudo Asuka. "Anyway, time is getting short and you should get back soon."  
“我真的对此感到疑惑，”伪明日香叹了口气，“无论如何，时间不多了，你该尽快回去了。”

"So this is goodbye I guess."  
"看来这就是告别了。"

"Until the rebirth of the Tree of Life and the awakening of Tabris...yes...it is."  
"直到生命之树重生，塔布里斯觉醒...是的...就是这样。"

Shinji nodded and turned his back away from the pseudo Asuka, though he heard her suddenly say something behind him.  
真嗣点点头，背对着假明日香，尽管他听到她在身后突然说了些什么。

"Aren't you going to ask me something?"  
"你不想问我些什么吗？"

"Like what?" "比如什么？"

"'...Who am I?'" "'...我是谁？'"

Shinji paused for a second before he smiled and said, "I'm Shinji Ikari, and thats all I care about."  
真嗣停顿了一下，然后微笑着说：“我是碇真嗣，这就足够了。”

Shinji turned and suddenly the darkness disappeared to be replaced with a blinding whiteness that lit the entire space up. As Shinji disappeared into the whiteness, the pseudo Asuka stood still in his conscious mind before it sighed and said, "Maybe he really has changed, and if he has," here her eyes flash a brief scarlet as she whispered, "Maybe he can usher in the rebirth."  
真嗣转身，突然间黑暗消失，取而代之的是一片耀眼的白色，照亮了整个空间。当真嗣消失在白光中时，伪明日香在他的意识中静止不动，然后叹了口气说：“也许他真的改变了，如果他真的改变了，”她的眼中闪过一抹猩红，低声说道，“也许他能引领重生。”

Without another word she vanished into a thin wisp of nothingness.  
她没有再说一句话，化作一缕虚无消失了。

Shinji's eyes flew open as though he had received a sharp electric shock, and quite possibly he had, since Rebecca had slapped him none to gently across the face. Upon seeing that his eyes had finally opened, Rebecca opened her mouth in apology, but Shinji quickly cut her off. He had to move fast.  
真嗣的眼睛猛地睁开，仿佛受到了强烈的电击，很可能确实如此，因为丽贝卡毫不客气地扇了他一巴掌。看到他的眼睛终于睁开，丽贝卡张嘴想要道歉，但真嗣迅速打断了她。他必须迅速行动。

"Rebecca how long was I out!"  
"丽贝卡，我昏迷了多久！"

"I-I don't know, maybe thirty seconds at most."  
"我，我不知道，最多可能只有三十秒。"

"Where is the nearest shelter?"  
"最近的避难所在哪里？"

"A few blocks that way," she replied as she gestured with her hand. "But what are you-"  
"那边几个街区，" 她边说边用手比划。"但你这是要做什么？"

"I can't explain now, I promise I will later. Just go there and stay there."  
"我现在解释不了，我保证之后会告诉你。你先去那里待着。"

"What are you-" "你在干什么——"

"Listen," said Shinji as he grabbed her shoulder in a gesture which was both hurriedly and gentle. "I can't say much about what happened just now, probably never will. But you have to trust me on this, I'm going to go somewhere, do something to help you and everyone. When I'm done I'll come back and see you...and I'll bring a friend if possible."  
"听着，" 真嗣说着，急切而温柔地抓住她的肩膀。"刚才发生的事我不能多说，可能永远都不会说。但这件事上你必须相信我，我要去某个地方，做些事情来帮你和大家。等我完成了，我会回来见你……如果可能的话，我会带个朋友一起来。"

"That girl that you like?"  
"你喜欢的那个女孩？"

Before Shinji even bothered thinking about what she said, he replied, "Yes, I'll bring Asuka."  
在真嗣还没来得及思考她的话之前，他就回答道：“是的，我会带明日香来。”

"So her names Asu-" "所以她叫明日-"

Shinji quickly cut her off again by saying, "Not now...Go, just Go!"  
真嗣迅速再次打断她，说道：“现在不行……走吧，快走！”

Rebecca looked down at his face, which wasn't all that far from hers really and said, "Its a promise."  
丽贝卡低头看着他的脸，其实离她的并不远，说道：“这是承诺。”

Bringing him into a one armed hug, she let her hair fall over onto his face and past his shoulders.  
她用一只手臂搂住他，让头发垂落在他脸上，越过他的肩膀。

"You stay safe Shinji, you're a good kid."  
"你要保重，真嗣，你是个好孩子。"

"I'm not a kid." "我不是孩子了。"

"No...I don't suppose you are."  
"不……我想你确实不是了。"

Straightening up, Rebecca nodded and said, "I'll make you and this Asuka something special, instead of just grabbing something out of the refrigerator next time."  
挺直身子，丽贝卡点头说道：“下次我会为你和这个明日香做点特别的，而不是随便从冰箱里拿点东西。”

Shinji nodded and smiled slightly, before he turned around and started sprinting in the opposite direction.  
真嗣点点头，微微一笑，然后转身开始朝相反方向跑去。

Rebecca watched his retreating back for a second before she too proceeded on her way.  
丽贝卡注视着他的背影片刻，随后也继续前行。

Meanwhile, Zeruel touched down in Tokyo-3 and started the destruction that awaited the city.  
与此同时，零尔降落在东京-3，开始了对这座城市的毁灭。

**Very different then what I've done before as you probably see...  
这与我之前所做的截然不同，你大概能看出来...**

Epilogue after this but that doesn't count.** **Thank you to all the support I've received from everyone through these long two years. Its hard for me to believe that this is finally ending.

Lilith sat with her back against the Tree of Life, staring forward across the empty plane, her thoughts residing on Shinji and where his actions would take him. Whether she herself had orchestrated things so that it would reach this conclusion, she didn't know. She had affected both there lives to a certain extent, but ultimately, they had always seemed to have been drawn together ever since they had first met those many months ago. Even if Shinji wasn't an angel, that the Evangelions had never existed, that herself and Adam had never warred with each other, Lilith knew that Shinji and Asuka would still have connected as they did. She had to admit...she was jealous in a way; the two of them had something that she had never had. Well, that wasn't quite true she supposed...  
莉莉丝背靠着生命之树坐着，凝视着前方空荡荡的位面，她的思绪集中在真嗣身上，以及他的行动将带他走向何方。到底是不是她自己精心策划的，才会导致这样的结果，她不知道。她在一定程度上影响了两人的生活，但最终，自从几个月前第一次见面以来，他们似乎总是被吸引在一起。即使真嗣不是天使，即使新世纪福音战士从未存在过，即使她自己和亚当从未交战过，莉莉丝也知道真嗣和明日香仍然会像他们一样联系在一起。她不得不承认……她在某种程度上是嫉妒的；她嫉妒了。他们两个拥有了她从未拥有过的东西。嗯，她认为这并不完全正确……

Lilith titled her head upwards, looking at the dark sky devoid of any stars. She wondered how Shinji would fair inside the Black Egg. It was very easy to get lost within the sea of people, all of which were the same. But Shinji loved Asuka enough, and that alone would be enough to find her. After that though...  
莉莉丝抬起头，望着没有星星的漆黑天空。她想知道真嗣在黑蛋里会怎样。人海里很容易迷失方向，所有人都一样。但真嗣足够爱明日香，仅此一点就足以找到她。但在那之后...

"Hey...Rei?" mumbled Lilith as she continued looking upward.  
「喂……雷？」莉莉丝一边低声说道，一边继续向上看。

From within her, Rei replied.  
丽从内心深处回答道。

"Are you still having doubts about those two?"  
“你对那两个人还有疑问吗？”

"Even if Asuka does agree to returning, the damage has already been done, both inside and out. Even though I promised Shinji that I would help, the only thing I can help with is-"  
「即使明日香同意回来，内里外外的伤害都已经造成了。虽然我答应真嗣会帮忙，但我唯一能帮忙的就是——」

"They will be able to shoulder that hardship, even if it does torment them for years to come. I have faith in them. Shinji and Asuka are entwined together as you thought so much so that one can't live without the other."  
“他们将能够承受这种困难，即使这会在未来的岁月里折磨他们。我对他们有信心。真嗣和明日香是纠缠在一起的，因为你想得太多了，以至于一个人不能没有另一个人生活。”

"Do you have any idea why that is? You were able to observe them better than I was after all."  
“你知道这是为什么吗？你毕竟比我能更好地观察它们。”

"I can only say that they are connected in a way rarely seen by humans in this day and age. They are very much incomplete, but together, they are more whole. They make up for each others faults and problems, and are able to understand each other because they share similarities. Love doesn't describe there bond so much as the need to be close to each other. Even if they had just stayed friends, they would have still desired that warmth of being near."  
“我只能说，它们以当今时代人类很少见的方式联系在一起。它们非常不完整，但组合在一起，它们就更完整了。它们弥补了彼此的缺点和问题，并且能够彼此理解，因为他们有相似之处。爱并不更多地描述了彼此之间的联系，即使他们只是朋友，他们仍然渴望接近的温暖。”

"Was there ever a possibility of them breaking apart?"  
“他们有分手的可能吗？”

"Even now that possibility still exists, but Shinji should be able to negate that. His actions have driven them this far after all."  
「虽然现在这种可能性仍然存在，但真嗣应该能够否定这种可能性。毕竟是他的行为让他们走到了这一步。」

Lilith was silent now, as Rei finished speaking, but something still lingered on her mind.  
雷说完，莉莉丝沉默了，但她的脑海里仍然残留着一些东西。

"Rei, I consider you as much a part of my mind as I do myself...so what will happen to Shinji after him and Asuka return."  
“丽，我认为你就像我自己一样是我思想的一部分……那么他和明日香回来后真嗣会发生什么。”

"Meaning?" “意义？”

"After I...help them I mean..."  
“在我……帮助他们之后，我的意思是……”

Rei did not reply for a long while here, and seemed to be deep in thought over something which had troubled her for a long while. Eventually though, she voiced her thoughts on the matter.  
丽在这里良久没有回复，似乎正在思考一件困扰她许久的事情。但最终，她还是表达了自己对此事的看法。

"I understand what you are getting at, and that will not change, so the possibility would exist."  
“我明白你的意思，这一点不会改变，所以这种可能性是存在的。”

"I see," sighed Lilith glumly. If possible, she didn't want something like that to happen, as it could send everything into turmoil once again, but that wouldn't be her decision after all. That would be something Shinji and Asuka would have to deal with when the time came, if it ever did of course.  
“我明白了，”莉莉丝闷闷不乐地叹了口气。如果可以的话，她不希望这样的事情发生，因为这会让一切再次陷入混乱，但这毕竟不是她的决定。这将是真嗣和明日香到时候必须处理的事情，当然，如果确实如此的话。

Shinji had never given much thought as to how many people lived on the earth, but having several billions people talking to you all at once put it into perspective. It was like having a constant ache in your ear, unable to get ride of it. Everybody recognize Shinji for who he was, an entity that was unique for everyone else, somebody that could help him. Some even ridiculed him, yelling at him, screaming for him to help them. But Shinji couldn't do anything for them. Visions and such flashed by him, but everything was so blurred and meshed together that he couldn't tell any one person apart from anyone else.  
真嗣从来没有过多考虑过地球上有多少人，但有数十亿人同时与你交谈，你就可以正确地看待这个问题了。就好像你的耳朵经常疼痛，无法缓解。每个人都认识真嗣，他是一个对其他人而言独一无二的个体，一个可以帮助他的人。有些人甚至嘲笑他，对他大喊大叫，尖叫着要他帮助他们。但真嗣却无法为他们做任何事。幻象之类的东西在他眼前一闪而过，但一切都是那么模糊、交织在一起，让他分不清谁是谁。

He continued moving forward through the sea of LCL fluid, floating helplessly as he let it carry him forward. He kept thinking of Asuka, hoping that his thoughts would carry him to wherever she was, but he his mind kept on being assaulted by everyone else's thoughts. He saw mothers, fathers, children, grandfathers and grandmothers. He saw people of all kinds of nationalities, religions, and races. Personalities meshed together like a melting pot, making Shinji's head feeling like splitting. But he had to move forward, because Asuka was somewhere within here.  
他继续在拼箱液的海洋中前行，无助地漂浮着，让它带着他前进。他一直想着明日香，希望他的思绪能把他带到她所在的任何地方，但他的思绪不断受到其他人的思绪的攻击。他看到了母亲、父亲、孩子、祖父和祖母。他见过各种国籍、宗教和种族的人。不同的性格就像一个大熔炉一样交织在一起，让真嗣的头仿佛要裂开了。但他必须继续前进，因为明日香就在这里面的某个地方。

What would he say when he saw her? "I'm sorry for not telling you I loved you sooner? Sorry that I caused all this? Sorry that I caused all your pain and suffering?" That wouldn't cut it. Shinji wanted to say these things though, even if Asuka still hated him. He wanted to be truthful and heartfelt for once, instead of always running away from everything. He had been running away from everything all his life, never truly standing and facing it. But now, he just wanted to be with Asuka, even if she rejected him, even if she loathed him. He just wanted to say those three simple words to her.  
当他看到她时，他会说什么？ “对不起，我没有早点告诉你我爱你？对不起，我造成了这一切？对不起，我造成了你所有的痛苦和磨难？”那不会削减它。尽管明日香仍然讨厌他，但真嗣还是想说这些。他想要一次真诚和真心，而不是总是逃避一切。他一生都在逃避一切，从未真正站起来、面对它。但现在，他只想和明日香在一起，哪怕她拒绝他，哪怕她厌恶他。他只想对她说这简单的三个字。

This thought is what kept Shinji sane as he continued through the sea of LCL fluid.  
这个想法让真嗣在拼箱液体的海洋中继续前行时保持理智。

---

'Who am I?' '我是谁？'

'You are you and no one else.'  
“你就是你，没有别人。”

'What makes up the fact that I am me?'  
“什么构成了我就是我这个事实？”

'What do you mean?' '你是什么意思？'

'How do I know that I am me and not someone else?'  
“我怎么知道我就是我，而不是别人？”

'Why do you think you are someone else?'  
“你为什么认为你是别人？”

'I don't think that but...things don't feel right...'  
“我不这么认为，但是……事情感觉不太对劲……”

'What doesn't feel right?'  
“什么感觉不对劲？”

'I don't feel right.' “我感觉不对劲。”

'Does it hurt?' “痛吗？”

'It does...it hurts a lot. This pain...I-I've felt it before, and...I don't like it.'  
‘确实……很疼。这种疼痛……我、我以前感受过，而且……我不喜欢它。

'So you think something is...missing?'  
“那么你认为有什么东西……丢失了？”

'I do...but I don't know what...'  
“我愿意……但我不知道什么……”

'What exactly hurts?' “到底是什么痛？”

'...My heart...a constant pain in my heart, like a fist is clenching ahold of it.'  
“……我的心……我的心持续疼痛，就像一只拳头紧握着一样。”

'Maybe you lost something?'  
“也许你丢了什么东西？”

'I...lost something? But what?'  
‘我……丢了什么东西？但什么？

'That is for you to figure out, not me.'  
“这是你要弄清楚的，而不是我。”

Asuka opened her eyes into whiteness.  
明日香睁开眼睛，眼前一片惨白。

She was floating...no laying within a vast empty space of whiteness that seemed to stretch onward forever. She sat up, and looked around, searching for any distinguishing figure, but everything was still white.  
她漂浮着……不是躺在一片巨大的白色空间里，那片空间似乎永远向前延伸。她坐起身来，环顾四周，寻找任何明显的人影，但一切仍然是白色的。

"Where am I?" she wondered.  
“我在哪里？”她想知道。

Her voice, instead of echoing, seemed to be swallowed by the whiteness.  
她的声音不但没有回响，反而像是被白色吞噬了。

Standing up, she firstly noticed that she was naked, but this didn't seem to bother her for some reason. She ran her hands along her body, remembering the feel of it. Things were starting to come back to her. She placed a hand between her breasts, shuddering as she recalled the feel of the Lance of Longinus as it impaled her. She then ran her hand behind her head, running it through her hair. She also remembered the instantaneous death that had killed her. The pain, the horror, the feel of slipping away, and-  
站起来，她首先注意到自己赤身裸体，但不知为何，她似乎并没有对此感到困扰。她用手抚摸着自己的身体，回忆着那种感觉。她的心开始回过神来。她将一只手放在胸前，回想起朗基努斯之枪刺穿她的感觉，她不寒而栗。然后她把手放在脑后，梳理头发。她还记得杀死她的瞬间死亡。痛苦、恐惧、溜走的感觉，还有——

"Shinji," whispered Asuka.  
“真嗣，”明日香低声说道。

As she spoke his name, her heart seared with pain, bringing her to her knees. Her eyes opened wide as she remembered that last feel of his touch before she had been killed. The warmth that had passed between them, it felt so familiar.  
当她说出他的名字时，她的心一阵剧痛，让她跪倒在地。当她想起她被杀之前他最后一次触摸的感觉时，她睁大了眼睛。他们之间传递的温暖，感觉是那么熟悉。

Once again, Asuka's heart seared at this thought.  
想到这里，明日香的心再次变得灼热起来。

'What is wrong with me?' wondered Asuka.  
'我是怎么了？'明日香想知道。

Asuka stood up again, and started walking aimlessly in one direction, still looking for any noticeable landmark, but she seemed to be the only person within this space.  
明日香再次站起来，漫无目的地朝一个方向走去，仍在寻找任何明显的地标，但这个空间里似乎只有她一个人。

'Lonely again...huh?' thought Asuka sadly as she paused and looked around her. But hadn't that been how everything always was? She had never had friends in high school or college, and her father had always abused her. She had only ever had her Eva, but now that was even gone. And now with Shinji gone she was-  
“又孤独了……嗯？”明日香停下来环顾四周，悲伤地想。但一切不都是这样吗？她在高中或大学期间从未有过朋友，她的父亲总是虐待她。她曾经只有她的伊娃，但现在它甚至消失了。现在真嗣走了，她——

Asuka's heart ached with pain, but this time, her head felt like it had been cloven asunder as it brought her to the ground. She sank down, clutch both her hand and where her heart was. Everything about Shinji was-  
明日香的心一阵剧痛，但这一次，她的头就像被劈成两半一样，把她摔倒在地。她坐了下来，紧紧抓住自己的手和心脏所在的地方。关于真嗣的一切都是——

'If it hurts, then just don't think about it.'  
“如果很痛，那就别想了。”

'But I can't stop thinking about him,' replied Asuka as she felt pain hit her. 'After all, Shinji is someone that I-'  
“但我无法停止想他，”明日香回答道，她感到疼痛袭来。 “毕竟，真嗣是我——”

Asuka opened her eyes and looked around wildly. For a split second, she had thought she saw...no, she did see something. A bubble, completely round was floating effortlessly in the vast whiteness. Asuka stared at it for a long, while not believing what she was seeing. But as Asuka continued watching, several bubbles continued appearing, one right after the other in front of her until the entire place was filled with these strange bubbles.  
明日香睁开眼睛，疯狂地环顾四周。有那么一瞬间，她以为自己看到了……不，她确实看到了一些东西。一个浑圆的气泡，在浩瀚的白色之中，毫不费力地漂浮着。明日香盯着它看了很久，不敢相信自己所看到的。但随着明日香继续观察，几个气泡不断出现，一个接一个地出现在她的面前，直到整个地方都充满了这些奇怪的气泡。

Asuka stood up slowly, staring at the bubbles around her. As one neared her, she moved away from it, though as it passed her, she noticed something inside of it. Looking closer, she saw images flashing inside it.  
明日香缓缓站起身来，盯着周围的气泡。当其中一个靠近她时，她就远离它，但当它经过她时，她注意到里面有什么东西。仔细一看，她发现里面有影像在闪烁。

'Thats...me? And Misato? And...Shin...ji?"  
'这就是我？还有美里呢？还有……真……？”

Asuka gazed at the bubble, inside which showed herself, Misato, and Shinji, all gathered around the kitchen table of Misato apartment and eating breakfast. Both Shinji and Asuka were in there school uniforms, and Misato seemed to be about ready to leave for Nerv. Asuka watched as she yelled something at Shinji, who promptly stood up and grabbed something from the fridge. The her inside the bubble then said something else, making Shinji retort back as well. Very quickly, the two started arguing with each other across the kitchen table, while Misato seemed to be completely oblivious to this, making it apparent that it happened all to frequently.  
明日香凝视着气泡，里面出现了她自己、美里和真嗣，他们都围在美里公寓的厨房桌子旁吃着早餐。真嗣和明日香都穿着校服，美里似乎正准备出发去涅夫。明日香看着她对真嗣大喊大叫，真嗣立刻站起来，从冰箱里抓起一样东西。泡泡里的她又说了些什么，真嗣也反驳道。很快，两人就隔着餐桌争吵起来，而美里似乎完全没有注意到这一点，显然这一切都发生得很频繁。

"Is this...my memory?" mumbled Asuka as she reached towards the bubble. As her fingers touched it, it immediately popped, clear fluid like tear drops falling from it.  
“这……是我的记忆吗？”明日香一边向泡泡伸出手，一边咕哝道。当她的手指触碰到它的时候，它立刻爆开，透明的液体如泪珠般从里面流了下来。

Asuka felt something then, almost like a jolt of some sorts, like something had just struck her. A shiver ran down her back, and she had to wrap her arms around her body to prevent herself from shivering.  
明日香感觉到了什么，几乎像​​是某种震动，就像有什么东西刚刚击中了她。她的后背一阵颤抖，她不得不用双臂抱住自己的身体，才不至于发抖。

But she remembered now...that day. So Shinji had lived with her at Misato's apartment.  
但她现在想起来了……那天。所以真嗣和她一起住在美里的公寓里。

"Then all of these...all of these are my memories?"  
“那这一切……都是我的记忆？”

Asuka looked at all of them, and saw that all of them had one thing in common: they all had Shinji in them.  
明日香看着他们所有人，发现他们都有一个共同点：他们都有真嗣。

"These are...the memories I lost?"  
“这些就是……我失去的记忆？”

Asuka watched as her memories floated by her, each with Shinji in them. She saw her and Shinji at school, in the apartment, and even fighting angels.  
明日香看着她的记忆从她身边飘过，每一个记忆里都有真嗣。她在学校、在公寓、甚至在战斗天使中都看到了她和真嗣。

Asuka then noticed a particular memory, showing her and Shinji sitting side by side and listening to something that looked like a tape recorder. She reached her hands towards this one, and touched it briefly with her index finger. It immediately popped, and she was assaulted again by a strange jolt, but the memories that flowed from this were startling, and Asuka surprisingly found herself laughing.  
明日香随后注意到了一段特殊的记忆，显示她和真嗣并排坐着，听着类似录音机的东西。她把手伸向这个，用食指轻轻触碰了一下。它立即弹出，她再次受到一种奇怪的震动的袭击，但由此产生的记忆令人震惊，明日香惊讶地发现自己笑了。

She was remembering when her and Shinji had to be completely synchronized with each other to defeat the fifth angel. The torment of having to do everything together, that damn machine, the stupid clothes they had to wear for the entire thing...and of course, sleeping in the same room. But it made Asuka smile slightly, as she knew that things were much easier then than now.  
她记得她和真嗣必须完全同步才能击败第五天使。必须一起做所有事情的折磨，那台该死的机器，他们必须穿着愚蠢的衣服来完成整个事情……当然，还有睡在同一个房间。但这让明日香微微一笑，因为她知道那时候的事情比现在容易多了。

But-

"What is this?" mumbled Asuka in shock.  
“这是什么？”明日香震惊地嘟哝道。

She had just remembered when her father had come looking for her.  
她这才想起来，父亲来找她的时候。

This time, Asuka's heart hurt in a different way, bringing up memories she had long sealed within herself. She felt nauseous, sick with pain as she saw herself stand there in shock, saw as Shinji stood there defending her, pure hatred etched into his face. Another memory, another memory must have existed before this.  
这一次，明日香的心以不同的方式疼痛，唤起了她封印已久的记忆。当她看到自己震惊地站在那里，看到真嗣站在那里保护她时，她感到恶心，疼痛难忍，脸上刻满了纯粹的仇恨。另一种记忆，另一种记忆在此之前一定已经存在了。

Fighting off the sense of worry that plagued her now, Asuka searched for a memory which could tie the two together. She found one that caught her attention almost instantly. In the memory, she saw herself pressing her face against Shinji's shoulder, tears running down her face. Shinji had his hands wrapped around her waist as he comforted her. Whatever it was...Asuka was nervous about the memory, but her desire to know what happened won her over.  
明日香奋力摆脱现在困扰她的忧虑，寻找能够将两人联系在一起的记忆。她几乎立刻就发现了一个引起她注意的东西。记忆中，她看见自己把脸贴在真嗣的肩膀上，泪水顺着脸颊流下来。真嗣双手环住她的腰，安抚着她。不管是什么……明日香对这段记忆感到紧张，但她想知道发生了什么的渴望赢得了她的支持。

She touched it, and felt a fresh flood of memories hit her.  
她摸了摸它，感觉一股新鲜的记忆涌向她。

Herself and Shinji were talking about themselves openly, seemingly for the first time. Asuka told Shinji all about growing up with her father, and the torment that she had undergone until she left for college. Asuka felt the weakness hit her as she remembered how she had felt when she had broken down and cried into Shinji's shoulder. Her knees wobbled slightly, and she had to prevent herself from falling.  
她自己和真嗣似乎是第一次公开谈论自己。明日香向真嗣讲述了她和父亲一起长大的一切，以及她在上大学之前所经历的折磨。当明日香想起自己崩溃并靠在真嗣肩头哭泣时的感受时，她感到全身无力。她的膝盖微微颤抖，她必须防止自己跌倒。

"So...Shinji already knew about my father before they met," gasped Asuka as she pressed a hand against her chest.  
“所以……真嗣在他们见面之前就已经知道我父亲了，”明日香喘着气说道，她一只手按在胸前。

But what happened then? Asuka thought back to when her father had answered the door. She had been scared, because her father wanted to talk to her, but Shinji wasn't going to allow it. But then what? Everything else afterwards was one giant blank. And how was this possible? She didn't remember ever meeting her father, nor had Misato or anyone else even bothered to mention that he had showed up.  
但后来发生了什么？明日香回想起父亲开门的时候。她很害怕，因为她的父亲想和她说话，但真嗣不允许。但然后呢？之后的一切都是一片巨大的空白。这怎么可能呢？她不记得曾经见过她的父亲，美里或其他人甚至懒得提及他曾出现过。

Something must have happened...  
一定是发生了什么事情……

Asuka turned back to her memories, searching for something she didn't want to find, but she had to know. She had to know what had happened with her and Shinji.  
明日香回到记忆中，寻找着一些她不想找到，但又必须知道的东西。她必须知道她和真嗣之间发生了什么。

She looked around again, looking for anything that might speak to her. What would it be though? Asuka saw many memories, most seemingly just day to day things involving Shinji. Some intrigued her though, but it didn't seem to be one she was looking for, but she marked it all the same, wanting to come back to it later.  
她再次环顾四周，寻找任何可能对她说话的东西。那会是什么？明日香看到了很多记忆，大部分似乎只是与真嗣有关的日常事务。虽然有些东西引起了她的兴趣，但这似乎不是她要找的东西，但她还是做了标记，想稍后再回来看。

One jumped out at her though. She saw herself walking up the steps of Misato's apartment, rain lashing against her shoulders. She was wearing a sleeveless shirt with jeans cut off at the knees and a pair of sandals, something that suitable for the rain. Asuka watched as she walked to Misato's door and knocked on it. Several seconds later, the door was flung open, and Shinji stood there.  
不过，有一个人向她跳了过来。她看见自己走上美里公寓的台阶，雨水拍打着她的肩膀。她穿着一件无袖衬衫，搭配膝盖处剪裁的牛仔裤，脚上是一双适合下雨天穿的凉鞋。明日香看着她走到美里的门前，敲响了门。几秒后，门被推开，真嗣站在那里。

Asuka didn't have to look any further to know this was the memory she was looking for.  
明日香不用再看就知道这就是她要找的记忆。

She reached out with timid fingers, and touched it.  
她胆怯地伸出手指，触碰了它。

She was immediately hit by a sense of cold, as though she herself had just been splashed with ice cold water. The rest of the memory came to her. She remembered how Shinji had held her as she broke down completely, repeatedly saying his name more desperately than before. The next part made her blush a little though. She saw as Shinji fought her out of her soggy wet clothes, but let out a sigh as she remembered taking things into her own hands. If Shinji had continued, Asuka would have died of embarrassment.  
她顿时感觉浑身冰凉，就好像自己被泼了一盆冰水。剩下的记忆又浮现在她的脑海里。她记得当她彻底崩溃时，真嗣抱着她，比以前更加绝望地一遍又一遍地喊着他的名字。接下来的部分却让她脸红了一些。她看到真嗣把她从湿漉漉的衣服中挣脱出来，但当她想起自己把事情掌握在自己手中时，她叹了口气。如果真嗣继续下去的话，明日香就会羞愧而死。

Afterwards, the explanation came, which Asuka admittedly didn't care about. Everything was fitting together so perfectly, but it still felt like she was remembering it all from a third perspective. It was hard to believe that this all had transpired.  
随后有解释，明日香承认对此并不在意。一切都那么完美地结合在一起，但她仍然感觉这一切都是从第三个角度来回忆的。很难相信这一切都发生了。

But what happened next. 但接下来发生了什么。

Everything was a blur suddenly.  
一切突然变得模糊起来。

Asuka saw as her father returned with Misato in tow. How he had said he wanted to talk to her, how she had stood up for herself. And then-  
明日香看到父亲带着美里回来了。他如何说他想和她谈谈，她如何为自己辩护。进而-

Asuka heard those words that her father had spoken, and before anything else, she saw Shinji crashing his fist against her fathers jaw. Asuka remembered hearing the sound of the bone snapping, the impact as Shinji's fist collided against the side of her fathers temple. The bright red color as blood spewed forth from his mouth. Asuka felt herself almost unable to deal with it, but a part of her also remembered the feeling from that time.  
明日香听到了父亲所说的话，然后首先看到真嗣用拳头猛击父亲的下巴。明日香记得听到骨头折断的声音，以及真嗣的拳头撞击到她父亲太阳穴侧面时的冲击力。鲜红的血液，从他的口中喷涌而出。明日香觉得自己几乎无法应对，但她的一部分也想起了当时的感觉。

It was one of relief, and she hated herself for feeling that now. She knew everything that her father had done to her, but he was still her father.  
这是一种解脱，她恨自己现在有这种感觉。她知道父亲对她所做的一切，但他仍然是她的父亲。

'Is it right to feel like this?' she wondered as she saw Misato attempt to reprimand Shinji, only to have him brush it off.  
“这样的感觉对吗？”当她看到美里试图斥责真嗣时，她感到很奇怪，但他却置若罔闻。

Surely it was understandable? But she couldn't help wonder where her father was at that moment.  
这当然是可以理解的吗？但她不禁想知道父亲此时在哪里。

Afterwards, Asuka remembered herself going into Shinji's room to seek comfort, though it had been awkward, and she remembered not being able to say what was truly on her mind then. She was saddened by this, sad that so many opportunities had come, but she had let them slip through her grasp.  
之后，明日香记得自己走进真嗣的房间寻求安慰，尽管这很尴尬，而且她记得当时无法说出自己真正的想法。她为此感到悲伤，悲伤的是这么多的机会来了，但她却让它们从她的手中溜走了。

She now took a deep breath, and opened and closed her eyes. As much as her memories intrigued her, they took a lot out of her. Remembering what she felt at the time was particularly exhausting.  
她现在深吸了一口气，睁开又闭上眼睛。尽管她的记忆让她着迷，但它们却让她失去了很多。回想起当时的感受，她特别心累。

Looking at her memories though, she noticed the ones from earlier that she had marked. Flashes of her and Shinji doing things filled the memory, and Asuka walked over to it, staring at it. She watched as her and Shinji went to an italian restaurant, ate ice cream, and walked around an exhibit of pre-Second Impact oceanic animals.  
不过，翻看她的记忆，她注意到了之前她标记过的那些。记忆中充满了她和真嗣做事的画面，明日香走过去，盯着它看。她看着她和真嗣去了一家意大利餐厅，吃了冰淇淋，并在第二次撞击前的海洋动物展览中散步。

'Is this...a date?' wondered Asuka as she continued looking at the memory. She slowly stretched her hand out to it, and grasped it.  
“这是……约会吗？”明日香一边思考着，一边继续看着记忆。她缓缓伸出手，握住了它。

Her mind was instantly filled with memories from that day. She saw as her and Shinji walked around the ocean exhibit, albeit not talking to each other for a while, though after a time, they seemed to make up. Then they entered a gift shop, and Asuka seem to realize something then, seconds before it happened. She was waiting outside when Shinji came out, and Asuka watched as he gave her the dolphin earrings that she treasured. Asuka felt tears well up at the corner of her eyes as she felt herself overcome with happiness, remembering the feelings that coursed through her at that moment in time. She watched as her and Shinji embraced each other; watched as she pressed her face against his shirt, and Shinji buried his face in her fiery hair.  
她的脑海里顿时充满了那天的回忆。她看到她和真嗣绕着海洋展览走来走去，虽然有一段时间没有互相交谈，但过了一段时间，他们似乎又和好了。然后他们进入了一家礼品店，明日香似乎在事情发生前几秒钟意识到了什么。当真嗣出来时，她正在外面等着，明日香看着他把她珍藏的海豚耳环交给了她。明日香回忆起那一刻的感受，眼角涌出泪水，幸福感溢于言表。她看着自己和真嗣拥抱在一起。看着她把脸贴在他的衬衫上，真嗣把脸埋进她火热的头发里。

And then Misato, Ritsuko, and Kaji showed up. Even now, Asuka knew that she shouldn't have done that. She had been embarrassed when they had seen herself and Shinji, and had immediately turned defensive.  
然后美里、律子和梶就出现了。即使现在，明日香也知道自己不应该这么做。当他们看到自己和真嗣时，她感到很尴尬，并立即变得防御起来。

She watched as they slowly made there way towards the beach, and the eventual water fight that ensued between them. Asuka remembered as they lay beside each other, talking aimlessly about meeting each other. Feelings were shared during that moment, even if they weren't spoken aloud. Afterwards though, when Asuka remembered what she had done, she blushed crimson. She remembered the feel as her lips came into contact with Shinji's forehead, and even though it was intended to be friendly, something was concealed in it.  
她看着他们慢慢地走向海滩，最后他们之间发生了水战。明日香记得他们躺在一起，漫无目的地谈论着见面的事。在那一刻，即使没有大声说出，人们也表达了自己的感受。但事后，明日香想起自己的所作所为，不禁脸红了。她记得自己的嘴唇接触真嗣额头时的感觉，虽然是出于友好，但其中却隐藏着某种东西。

She stood there, surrounded by her memories and she thought about what she had seen and felt so far. What Shinji had said before...when she had been alive, about them being friends...they had certainly been more than just friends. They had loved each other, even if it had never been spoken, and even now, they seemed to still love each other. So then why had Shinji lied again even at the end of everything? Was he still trying to protect her, or was he just trying to protect himself?  
她站在那里，周围都是她的回忆，她回想着迄今为止所见所感。真嗣之前说过……当她还活着的时候，他们是朋友……他们肯定不仅仅是朋友。他们曾经彼此相爱，即使从未说过，即使是现在，他们似乎仍然相爱。那么为什么真嗣在一切结束后又再次撒谎呢？他到底是想保护她，还是只是想保护自己？

Asuka shook her head as she thought back to that day and everything that had transpired. Everything that had happened was a clear example of who they were to each other. Even after she lost her memories, and Shinji denied everything that had happened, they still loved each other. So wasn't that enough? Shouldn't they just accept it? If you love someone, shouldn't you just express that love to the person you feel for?  
明日香摇了摇头，回想起那天以及所发生的一切。所发生的一切都清楚地表明了他们对彼此的看法。即使在她失去记忆、真嗣否认所发生的一切之后，他们仍然彼此相爱。那么这还不够吗？难道他们不应该接受吗？如果你爱一个人，你不应该向你所爱的人表达你的爱吗？

But they were also both fifteen, and had never known love of any form, so it was all so confusing.  
但他们也都十五岁了，从来不知道任何形式的爱情，所以这一切都是那么令人困惑。

Asuka looked back at her memories, now looking for one in particular. She wanted to find the one that had ended everything, the last memory before she had lost them. If she could trust what Ritsuko had said before, it had been an angel that had destroyed her memories of Shinji. So if she found something that looked like that-  
明日香回顾自己的记忆，现在正在寻找一个特别的记忆。她想要找到那个结束一切的人，找到她失去一切之前的最后一段记忆。如果她能相信律子之前所说的话，那么摧毁她关于真嗣的记忆的就是天使。所以如果她发现了类似的东西——

'Maybe this is it,' thought Asuka as she turned towards her right and saw one memory in particular. It didn't show Shinji, only herself enclosed in a white area, similar to the one she was in. She had her hands covering her head and was screaming something.  
“也许就是这样，”明日香想道，她转向右侧，看到了一个特别的记忆。它没有显示真嗣，只有她自己被包围在一个白色区域中，类似于她所在的区域。她双手捂着头，正在尖叫着什么。

Asuka neared this one, and looked at it closer. This was likely it...but remembering something like this, was that necessarily the best thing to do? Asuka continued staring at it, trying to understand the words she was saying. Something like this maybe...  
明日香靠近这个，仔细观察。大概就是这样……但是记住这样的事情，就一定是最好的事情吗？明日香继续盯着它，试图理解她所说的话。类似这样的事情也许...

But she reached forward anyway, and touched it.  
但她还是向前伸出手，触摸了它。

Pain exploded inside of Asuka's head. She screamed out, remembering the feel as her mind was violated, everything laid forth for the angel to see. Everything that she had ever happened during her childhood, she remembered, many things that she had done with Shinji, she saw and felt. And then-  
明日香的脑袋里一阵剧痛。她尖叫起来，回想起她的心灵被侵犯的感觉，一切都摆在天使面前。童年时发生的一切，她都记得，她和真嗣一起做过的许多事情，她都亲眼所见，感受到。进而-

Asuka's eyes turned white as the pain became unbearable. She felt hands touch her, running all along her body, grasping her painfully. She bit down on her tongue, preventing herself from screaming out. She saw a face, a horrible face which made her cringe, made her lose herself completely.  
疼痛变得难以忍受，明日香的眼睛变成了白色。她感觉到有双手抚摸着她，沿着她的身体，痛苦地抓着她。她咬住舌头，不让自己尖叫出来。她看到了一张脸，一张可怕的脸，让她感到畏缩，让她完全失去了自我。

And then it stopped. 然后它就停了。

Asuka fell to the ground, her body covered in sweat as she shivered uncontrollably. Everything...she had relived everything in a seconds notice, even things she didn't fully understand. She felt strange, disgusted, weak, violated. Her head hurt, her body hurt, her heart heart. Things were foggy, her recovered memories of Shinji blurred around the edges.  
明日香倒在地上，浑身都是汗，无法控制地颤抖着。一切……她在一瞬间就重温了一切，甚至是她不完全理解的事情。她感到奇怪、厌恶、软弱、被侵犯。她的头很痛，她的身体很痛，她的心也很痛。事情变得扑朔迷离，她恢复的有关真嗣的记忆也变得模糊起来。

'No...I don't want this...this pain,' thought Asuka.  
“不……我不想这样……这种痛苦，”明日香想。

'This is the price that comes with remembering everything again. You remember the good, and the bad.'  
“这就是再次记住一切的代价。”你会记住好的和坏的。

'No...no...' wined Asuka.  
“不……不……”明日香喝道。

From in front of her, came a memory unlike the others, a memory with no images, only black. Asuka saw this memory, and immediately knew that this was a bad memory, something that she never wanted to see. She stood up slowly, bracing herself as she did so. No matter what, she didn't want to know what-  
从她的面前，传来了一段与其他人不同的记忆，一段没有图像，只有黑色的记忆。明日香看到这段记忆，立刻就知道这是一段不好的记忆，是她永远不想看到的。她慢慢地站了起来，同时也做好了准备。无论如何，她不想知道什么——

The memory suddenly surged forward, enclosing Asuka's entire body in darkness. She was immediately thrown back to that time, that point in when she had been at her weakness. She saw the face, felt the breath of him, the feel as he touched her body. She wanted to scream out for help, but nobody was nearby, nobody to help her. He hit her repeatedly, tore at her body, mocked her. She wasn't going to make it...he was getting closer. The pain hit her; her heart cried out for help, her mind was growing hazy.  
记忆猛然向前涌动，将明日香的全身笼罩在黑暗之中。她立刻就被抛回到了那个时候，那个她最软弱的时候。她看到了他的脸，感觉到了他的呼吸，感觉到了他触碰她身体的感觉。她想大声呼救，但附近没有人，也没有人帮助她。他不断地打她，撕扯她的身体，嘲笑她。她不会成功的……他越来越近了。疼痛向她袭来；她的心在呼喊救命，她的思绪越来越模糊。

Bright light suddenly broke through the darkness, and Asuka saw Shinji standing there, an odd glow seeming to radiate off of him. His eyes glowed bright red as he marched towards the rapist. It happened in an orange flash of light. The body was torn asunder. Bone was crushed, limbs were shredded, fluid sprayed across the ground, and the head was turned into a ground meat.  
明亮的光芒突然冲破了黑暗，明日香看到真嗣站在那里，身上似乎散发着奇怪的光芒。当他走向强奸犯时，他的眼睛发出鲜红的光芒。事情发生在一道橙色的闪光中。身体被撕裂了。骨头被压碎，四肢被撕碎，液体喷洒在地上，头颅也变成了肉末。

Asuka shivered uncontrollably, her mind still hazy. This was...this was...  
明日香无法控制地颤抖着，她的大脑仍然一片混沌。这是……这是……

Something which should have stayed buried.  
一些本应被埋葬的东西。

The attempted rape, Shinji's ascension, the two things wove a web within Asuka's mind, preventing her to think of anything else. She could remember the feel of the hands, smell the blood, hear the crushing of the skull.  
强奸未遂，真嗣的升天，这两件事在明日香的脑海中编织了一张网，让她无法思考其他事情。她记得手的感觉、血的味道、头骨破碎的声音。

She felt like puking. 她感觉想吐。

How could she have forgotten something like this? But it was best that she had forgotten it...and now that she had.  
她怎么会忘记这样的事情？但最好她已经忘记了……现在她已经忘记了。

The feel...the feel of helplessness...even now it still.  
那种感觉……那种无助的感觉……至今依然如此。

"Shinji," mumbled Asuka as she sat there, staring at the white ground.  
“真嗣，”明日香坐在那里，盯着白色的地面，咕哝道。

It was overpowering her, that feel. Unable to do anything, never able to do a thing. Her father, the angel, the rapist. It all felt too real. She didn't know how to-  
那种感觉压倒了她。什么都做不了，什么都做不了。她的父亲，天使，强奸犯。这一切都感觉太真实了。她不知道如何——

Asuka suddenly felt her eyes lose focus. No! Not now! If you pass out now-  
明日香突然感觉自己的目光失去了焦点。不！现在不要！如果你现在昏倒了-

Asuka forced herself to fight the pain. She could beat it, she had before.  
明日香强迫自己对抗疼痛。她可以战胜它，她以前就做到了。

But that was because Shinji was with her, and now without him-  
但那是因为真嗣和她在一起，而现在他不在了——

Asuka tilted to her right, and fell to the ground, tears streaming from her eyes. Even if she could remember Shinji, having him by her side wasn't the same. If only she could feel him, know that he was still somewhere out there. But she didn't even know where was.  
明日香向右倾斜，倒在地上，泪水从眼中流淌出来。即使她记得真嗣，有他在她身边也不一样。如果她能感觉到他，知道他还在外面的某个地方就好了。但她根本不知道这是哪里。

Everything was too overpowering. Her memories held cherished thoughts, but they also held bitter ones, sad ones, ones that were too painful to think about. She wanted everything to just slip away. If this was how things would be, then she would rather not have remembered any of this.  
一切都太过势不可挡。她的记忆里有珍贵的想法，但也有苦涩的、悲伤的、痛苦不堪的想法。她希望一切就这么溜走。如果事情真的是这样，那她宁愿不记得这一切。

'It hurts,' mumbled Asuka. 'It hurts a lot.'  
“很痛。”明日香咕哝道。 '非常疼。'

And without anybody there to comfort her, Asuka slowly started to slip away...  
没有人安慰她，明日香慢慢地开始溜走……

---

Shinji was starting to get desperate. He had no idea how long it had been since he had entered the black sphere, but he still hadn't managed to find Asuka. What was he doing wrong? Why wasn't he able to find her. Was it impossible as Lilith had hinted at? But he was trying with everything he had damn it! If he wasn't able to find Asuka...  
真嗣开始绝望了。他不知道自己进入黑色球体已经有多久了，但他仍然没有找到明日香。他做错了什么？为什么他找不到她。难道真像莉莉丝暗示的那样不可能吗？但他正在竭尽全力地尝试！如果他找不到明日香的话……

'No, don't think like that,' Shinji told himself. 'Everything will be fine!'  
“不，不要这样想，”真嗣告诉自己。 '一切都会好起来的！'

But there was a small voice in the back of his mind that asked, 'What if?'  
但他内心深处有一个小小的声音问：“如果呢？”

Shinji didn't want to answer what if.  
真嗣不想回答“如果”的话。

The LCL fluid still seemed to have a mind of its own, and just carried him wherever it pleased. Even though Shinji had his mind on Asuka, it still didn't seem to be enough.  
拼箱液体似乎仍然有自己的意志，可以带着他去任何它想去的地方。尽管真嗣把心思放在明日香身上，但似乎还不够。

So then what did he have to do?  
那么他必须做什么呢？

Shinji had managed to tune most of the voices out by then, so that wasn't the problem here. It was like the LCL fluid didn't want him to go to where Asuka was.  
那时真嗣已经成功地消除了大部分声音，所以这不是这里的问题。就好像拼箱液不想让他去明日香所在的地方一样。

'Fuck that,' thought Shinji bitterly as he paused in the midst of the LCL fluid. He looked all around him, looking for anything that might help him. Asuka was somewhere within here right now, and Shinji new that she needed him. Some of her memories were best left untouched if at all possible, if she did remember them...  
“操，”真嗣在拼箱液体中间停了下来，痛苦地想。他环顾四周，寻找任何对他有帮助的东西。明日香现在就在这儿的某个地方，真嗣得知她需要他。如果可能的话，她的一些记忆最好不要被触及，如果她确实记得的话……

'Damn it,' thought Shinji.  
“该死，”真嗣想。

Now stationary, Shinji put all his thoughts into Asuka, and projected his AT-field outward, searching for her. The AT-field was an embodiment of who he is as a person, and with his feelings of Asuka projected into it, he should hopefully be able to find her.  
真嗣一动不动，将全部心思集中在明日香身上，向外投射AT力场，寻找她。 AT场是他这个人的体现，加上他对明日香的感情投射到其中，他应该有希望能够找到她。

But after many times of searching, Shinji didn't seem to be able to find Asuka. It was almost like she wasn't even there.  
但经过多次寻找，真嗣似乎都没有找到明日香。就好像她根本不存在一样。

'Is that possible though?' wondered Shinji. 'Could she be somewhere else?'  
“那可能吗？”真嗣想知道。 “她会不会在别的地方？”

But if she wasn't here, then where would she be?  
但如果她不在这里，那么她会在哪里？

'No, she had to be here, Lilith was sure of that much. But the problem is where. She likely sectioned herself off from everyone else, because of her grasp on herself, so that would mean-'  
“不，她必须在这里，莉莉丝确信这一点。但问题是在哪里。她很可能因为对自己的掌控而将自己与其他人隔离开来，所以这意味着——”

"Is there another part of this place?" mumbled Shinji. He didn't really see how there could be, unless Asuka had somehow created it herself.  
“这个地方还有别的地方吗？”真嗣咕哝道。他真的不明白怎么会有这种东西，除非明日香自己创造了它。

Shinji looked around him, but only saw LCL fluid that went on forever. But even so, the voices had diminished so that he didn't hear them as clearly anymore. It was like he had reached a different part of the sphere almost.  
真嗣环顾四周，却只看到了一直持续不断的拼箱液体。但即便如此，声音还是变小了，他听得不太清楚了。就好像他几乎到达了球体的另一个部分。

'More than anything else, I want to find Asuka right. To find her...and tell her anything. If those feelings aren't strong enough...'  
“最重要的是，我想找到明日香的正确身份。找到她……并告诉她任何事情。如果这些感觉还不够强烈的话……”

Once again, Shinji projected his AT-field outward, this time in a different direction.  
真嗣再一次向外投射他的AT力场，这次是在不同的方向。

'Asuka...Asuka...where are you right now? Are you lonely? What are you doing right now? What are you thinking? I want to see you...'  
“明日香……明日香……你现在在哪里？你孤单吗？你现在在做什么？你在想什么？我要见你...'

Shinji felt something strike his heart then, heard something almost echo inside of him. What was it? Something that was conjured up, something from a long time ago. A memory? Yes, a memory! A certain feel? A certain warmth? Between two people? The feel of embracing, the feel of kissing, the feel of love?  
真嗣感到有什么东西击中了他的心，几乎听到了他内心深处的回声。它以前如何？一些被召唤出来的东西，一些很久以前的东西。记忆？是的，一段回忆！某种感觉？某种温暖？两个人之间？拥抱的感觉，亲吻的感觉，爱的感觉？

Shinji's eyes darted towards a certain spot within the LCL fluid. Maybe it was simply the angel half of him speaking up, or it was something more human reacting to it, but this spot felt...unnatural almost.  
真嗣的目光飞向拼箱液体中的某个地方。也许这只是他一半的天使在说话，或者是一些更人性的反应，但这个地方感觉……几乎不自然。

Shinji paused in front of it, and ran a hand over the air. Nothing happened, but Shinji felt as though his hand had passed through something. Moving forward, and walked through what could only be described as a curtain of water. LCL fluid filled this entire space also, but in the center of it, floating unsupportably was-  
真嗣在它面前停了下来，伸出一只手在空中抚摸。什么都没发生，但真嗣感觉自己的手好像穿过了什么东西。继续往前走，走过了只能用水幕来形容的地方。拼箱液体也充满了整个空间，但在它的中央，却难以支撑地漂浮着——

"Asuka!" “飞鸟！”

Shinji moved forward, guided by his thoughts until he reached Asuka. He stretched out his hand, and caressed her face gently. She was unusually cold.  
真嗣在思绪的引导下向前移动，直到到达明日香面前。他伸出手，轻轻抚上她的脸。她异常冷漠。

"...Asuka," repeated Shinji. It felt like an eternity since he had seen her. But something was wrong. Her eyes were closed, and she wasn't moving.  
“……明日香，”真嗣重复道。自从见到她以来，他感觉就像过了一个世纪。但出了点问题。她的眼睛紧闭着，一动不动。

Without a second thought, Shinji projected his AT-field over her, and immediately noticed a change within her. Some of her memories had returned, some of which he had wished hadn't. He winced horribly and felt a low throb in his heart as he remembered his anger and rage over a certain event.  
真嗣不假思索地将AT力场投射到她身上，并立即注意到她体内的变化。她的一些记忆已经恢复，其中一些他希望没有。当他想起自己对某件事的愤怒和愤怒时，他猛地皱起眉头，心里一阵低沉的抽动。

But if she had remembered memories like that...  
但如果她还记得那样的记忆的话……

'You may not like the outcome.'  
“你可能不喜欢这个结果。”

Lilith's words echoed inside his head.  
莉莉丝的话在他脑海中回响。

If he didn't like the outcome, then he would just change it. Wasn't that what he had been doing for the longest time now after all?  
如果他不喜欢这个结果，那么他就会改变它。这不正是他已经做了很长时间的事了吗？

Shinji closed his eyes, and blended his AT-field with Asuka's. If any two people had tried this, it likely would not have worked. But since these two individuals were able to understand and love each other, it was able to work.  
真嗣闭上眼睛，将自己的AT力场与明日香的融合起来。如果任何两个人尝试过这一点，很可能都不会成功。但由于这两个人能够相互理解和相爱，所以它能够发挥作用。

Shinji slowly felt his mind start to fade as he entered into Asuka's thoughts. He only hoped that this decision was the right one.  
当真嗣进入明日香的思绪时，他慢慢地感觉到自己的思绪开始模糊。他只希望这个决定是正确的。

---

Shinji opened his eyes, taking several seconds to adjust to the light; everything was a whiteness that went on forever. Shinji stood up and looked down at his body, noticing that he was naked, but not caring that much.  
真嗣睁开了眼睛，花了几秒钟才适应了光线。一切都是一片白色，永远持续下去。真嗣站起来，低头看着自己的身体，发现他赤身裸体，但并没有太在意。

As he looked around he didn't see any defining features. He didn't even see Asuka in this emptiness. But she had to be here somewhere.  
当他环顾四周时，他没有看到任何明显的特征。在这片空虚中，他甚至没有看到明日香。但她必须在这儿的某个地方。

Shinji started moving forward, turning every which way as he went, searching for some sign of Asuka. Once or twice, he tried sending out his AT-field, but he supposed that was impractical right now.  
真嗣开始向前走，边走边转，寻找明日香的踪迹。有一两次，他尝试发出他的 AT 场，但他认为现在这是不切实际的。

'Just how big is this place exactly?' wondered Shinji.  
“这个地方到底有多大？”真嗣想知道。

As Shinji thought this, he saw something which made him rub his eyes, thinking he was tired. A bubble was floating along in the air, a bubble which was flashes images of himself. Shinji stared at this for a long while, watching it as it passed him. Shinji then turned towards the direction of where it had came from, and saw many other bubbles like it.  
正当真嗣这么想的时候，他看到了一些东西，让他揉了揉眼睛，以为自己累了。空气中漂浮着一个气泡，一个气泡中闪烁着他自己的影像。真嗣盯着它看了很久，看着它从他身边经过。真嗣转头看向它来的方向，看到了许多类似的气泡。

'Are these Asuka's memories?' thought Shinji.  
“这些是明日香的记忆吗？”真嗣想。

As Shinji rushed in the direction the memories came from, he noticed all of them had something to do with him, ones that Asuka should certainly have forgotten, yet here they were. Some of them Shinji had even forgotten himself, so he was surprised to see them. He had forgotten how different things were before he had gotten his angel powers. If things could only have stayed the same...  
当真嗣冲向记忆来源的方向时，他发现所有这些记忆都与他有关，明日香当然应该忘记的，但它们却在这里。其中一些真嗣甚至忘记了自己，所以他看到他们感到很惊讶。他已经忘记了在获得天使力量之前事情有多么不同。如果事情能保持不变就好了……

Shinji finally reached where the memories had congregated, and ran towards them, careful to dodge them as he went, afraid of popping them. As he neared the center, he saw a shape on the floor, completely different than that of the memories. The fiery hair of Asuka stood out particularly bright in the expanse of whiteness.  
真嗣终于到达了记忆聚集的地方，向他们跑去，边走边小心地躲开它们，生怕撞到它们。当他接近中心的时候，他看到地板上有一个与记忆中完全不同的形状。明日香火红的头发在一片白色中显得格外耀眼。

"Asuka!" shouted Shinji. “飞鸟！”真嗣喊道。

Asuka gave no sign that she heard him, but her head did turn slightly to its left, looking towards him.  
明日香没有表现出听到他说话的迹象，但她的头确实稍微向左转，看向他。

Shinji threw himself to the ground beside her, grabbing her shoulders and pulling her towards himself, cradling her in his arms, giving no sign that he cared that she also was naked. Even now she was unusually cold. Her skin was pale white, and her lips had a light purple tinge to them. But it was her eyes that scared Shinji. They were hazy, as though not really seeing anything.  
真嗣倒在她身旁的地上，抓住她的肩膀，将她拉向自己，将她搂在怀里，丝毫没有表现出他在意她也赤身裸体。即使现在，她也异常冷漠。她的皮肤白皙，嘴唇带着浅紫色。但真正让真嗣害怕的是她的眼睛。他们目光朦胧，仿佛什么也没看见。

"Asuka...c'mon Asuka...wake up..."  
“明日香……来吧，明日香……醒醒……”

Shinji stared down at her face. Her eyes were fixated on him, but Shinji knew that she wasn't really seeing him.  
真嗣低头看着她的脸。她的眼睛盯着他，但真嗣知道她并不是真的在看他。

"C'mon...this is a joke...right? Asuka!"  
“得了吧……这是个玩笑……对吗？明日香！”

Shinji yelled her name again, pressing his body against hers, trying to convey the feeling of warmth. He buried his face in her hair, running his hand along her bare back, trying to bring her back.  
真嗣再次喊着她的名字，将自己的身体压在她的身上，试图传达温暖的感觉。他把脸埋进她的头发里，用手抚摸着她光秃秃的后背，试图把她拉回来。

"Something...anything...Asuka please." Shinji started crying, his tears falling upon her face.  
“有事……有事……明日香拜托了。”真嗣开始哭泣，泪水落在她的脸上。

He never even got to tell her-  
他甚至都没来得及告诉她——

...shin... ...胫...

Shinji opened his tear strained eyes and looked down at her  
真嗣睁开泪眼，低头看着她

...shin...ji... ……申……吉……

Asuka opened and closed her mouth, her voice barely more than a whisper.  
明日香张开嘴又闭上，她的声音几乎只是耳语。

"Asuka!" “飞鸟！”

"Shin...ji? “新……吉？

"Asuka are you-" “明日香你是——”

"Shinji...listen..." mumbled Asuka.  
“真嗣……听着……”明日香咕哝道。

"Asuka don't say anything else, I-"  
“明日香别再说什么了，我——”

"I remembered everything...everything painful, everything wonderful..."  
“我记得一切……一切痛苦的事情，一切美好的事情……”

Shinji was silent as he held her, looking down at her face. She was speaking in a very low voice, her eyes still clouded over.  
真嗣沉默地抱着她，低头看着她的脸。她说话的声音很低，眼神依然阴沉。

"And Shinji...there was a lot of pain involved, but I'm still glad that I chose to remember you..."  
“而真嗣……虽然经历了很多痛苦，但我仍然很高兴我选择记住你……”

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

Asuka smiled, and cupped Shinji's face with one of her hands. "Idiot...don't cry like that."  
明日香微笑着，用一只手捧起真嗣的脸。 “笨蛋……别哭了。”

"But...you..." started Shinji.  
“但是……你……”真嗣开口道。

But Asuka placed her index finger against his lips, silencing him.  
但明日香将食指放在他的嘴唇上，让他闭嘴。

"Don't say anything, because this is difficult for me," said Asuka with a low sigh. I've just remembered countless things, many of which I'd rather not remember. So don't say anything right now...I'm still not feeling very well...but having you here is..."  
“别说什么，因为这对我来说很难。”明日香低声叹了口气说道。我刚刚想起了无数的事情，其中​​很多我宁愿不记得。所以现在什么都别说……我还是感觉不太舒服……但是有你在这里是……”

Asuka turned her face, pressing it against Shinji's chest.  
明日香转过脸，将脸贴在真嗣的胸口上。

"...better," she mumbled quietly.  
“……好多了。”她低声咕哝道。

Shinji stared down at Asuka's face pressed against his chest. Her body was slightly warmer now, and her eyes seemed to be regaining their normal clear blue color.  
真嗣低头看着明日香贴在自己胸口的脸。她的身体现在稍微暖和了，她的眼睛似乎也恢复了正常的清澈蓝色。

"Hmmm...okay," said Shinji as he rested his chin upon her head.  
“嗯……好吧，”真嗣把下巴靠在她的头上说道。

They stayed like that for an unforetold amount of time, and Shinji had nodded off several times while watching Asuka. After a long while though, Shinji felt himself being roused awake by something soft. As he slowly opened his eyes, his vision was completely taken up by Asuka who was sitting in front of him and lightly tapping his cheek.  
他们就这样呆了很长一段时间，真嗣看着明日香，好几次打瞌睡。过了好一会儿，真嗣感觉自己被某种柔软的东西惊醒了。当他缓缓睁开眼睛时，他的视线完全被坐在他面前轻轻拍着他脸颊的明日香占据。

"Shinji? You awake?" “真嗣？你醒了？”

"...Yeah...sorry..." “……是啊……抱歉……”

"No...don't be. You came to get me. Any longer and I probably would have faded completely."  
“不……别这样。你是来抓我的。再拖下去我可能就彻底消失了。”

"What happened to you? What were you like that? I thought that you had-"  
“你怎么了？你当时是什么样子？我以为你——”

"I remembered...certain things. They affected me heavily, probably always will. I almost shut myself out, simply because it was easier to do that have to remember the pain. Without you there Shinji, I wasn't able to continue. Any later and I would have-"  
“我记得……某些事情。它们对我影响很大，可能永远都会。我几乎把自己拒之门外，只是因为记住痛苦更容易做到。没有你在，真嗣，我无法继续下去再晚一点，我就会——”

"Don't say that, I don't want to think about that," said Shinji as he shook his head.  
“别这么说，我不想考虑这个。”真嗣摇摇头说道。

"Thank you," said Asuka wearily.  
“谢谢你。”明日香疲倦地说。

"Are you okay?" asked Shinji.  
“你还好吗？”真嗣问道。

"Yes..and no," said Asuka. "Everything hurts, but I am at the same time happy that I could see you, which makes me have to ask, where are we exactly?"  
“是的……也不是，”明日香说。 “一切都很痛苦，但我同时很高兴能见到你，这让我不得不问，我们到底在哪里？”

"In the Black Egg of Lilith I suppose," said Shinji.  
“我想是在莉莉丝的黑蛋里。”真嗣说道。

"So then, this is Third Impact? Are we in the middle of Instrumentality?"  
“那么，这是第三次冲击吗？我们正处于工具性之中吗？”

"We were, but I talked to Lilith, and we reached an understanding. Its really thanks to Lilith and Rei that I was able to find you."  
“是的，但是我和莉莉丝谈过，我们达成了谅解。真的多亏了莉莉丝和丽，我才能够找到你们。”

Asuka was silent however, her face expressionless.  
然而明日香却沉默不语，面无表情。

"Are you angry at her, for killing you?" asked Shinji eventually.  
“你因为她杀了你而生她的气吗？”真嗣最终问道。

"I am, but I can still feel the pain of dying..."  
“是啊，但我还是能感受到死亡的痛苦……”

"Don't worry, it will pass," Shinji assured her.  
“别担心，一切都会过去的。”真嗣向她保证。

"...I...hope so," sighed Asuka.  
“……我……希望如此，”明日香叹息道。

Shinji looked down at her face, surprised at how worn it seemed. Even though Asuka was only fifteen, she seemed to have aged exponentially during her time in here.  
真嗣低头看着她的脸，惊讶地发现她的脸是如此憔悴。尽管明日香只有十五岁，但在这里的这段时间里，她似乎苍老了很多。

"How are you feeling?" Shinji asked her.  
“你感觉怎么样？”真嗣问她。

"Better I suppose, though still very tired. My mind is a whirl of things, and I'm having trouble keeping track of the different memories. Its like, a different me existed in the memories from before; I'm having trouble coming to terms with that. And yourself also...you were also very different."  
“我想好多了，虽然还是很累。我的脑子里乱七八糟，我很难记住不同的记忆。就像，记忆中存在着一个与以前不同的我；我很难恢复过来。”就这一点而言，你自己也很不同。”

"I know..." mumbled Shinji.  
“我知道……”真嗣咕哝道。

"Why did you do it Shinji? Why didn't you just tell me flat out that we had loved each other? Even at the end, you still lied to me about us, saying that we were only friends."  
“你为什么要这么做，真嗣？你为什么不直接告诉我我们彼此相爱？甚至到了最后，你仍然对我们撒谎，说我们只是朋友。”

Shinji had hoped that she wouldn't bring this up, but he didn't have any way of evading the question.  
真嗣本来希望她不要提起这件事，但他却没有办法回避这个问题。

"I told you before about my visions and how I was able to see possibilities of the future involved with the people around me. You were always at the forefront of my mind, and I tried denying that by rejecting what I felt. I sealed off my own emotions after you lost your memories, but that didn't work of course. I still remembered things, even if they were very vague. I knew what had happened once, and knew that it could happen again. I couldn't let anything happen to you however, and promised myself that I would do everything in my power to prevent you from entering an Evangelion again. But you proved too stubborn, and surprised me again and again."  
“我之前告诉过你我的愿景，以及我如何能够看到与周围的人有关的未来的可能性。你总是在我的脑海中，我试图通过拒绝我的感受来否认这一点。我封锁了你失去记忆后我自己的情绪，但这当然不起作用，即使它们非常模糊，我知道曾经发生过什么，并且知道它可能会再次发生。不管你发生什么事情，我都向自己保证，我会尽一切努力阻止你再次进入新世纪福音战士，但事实证明你太固执了，一次又一次让我感到惊讶。”

Asuka stared back at him, her face mere inches away from his. Looking down at his chest, she rest her head against it and spoke softly.  
明日香回望着他，她的脸距离他的脸只有几英寸。低头看着他的胸口，她把头靠在他的胸口上，轻声说道。

"The feeling had always been there as you said, but it always hurt...just seeing you hurt sometimes. And those earrings...that day confuses me, but I still understand what had happened, and yet, everything was snatched away afterwards."  
“就像你说的，这种感觉一直都在，但总是很痛……只是有时看到你受伤。还有那些耳环……那天让我很困惑，但我仍然明白发生了什么，然而，一切都被夺走了。”然后。”

"It was," Shinji nodded. “是的。”真嗣点点头。

Asuka was silent now, her face still pressed against Shinji's chest, not carrying that hers and his bodies were so entwined with each other.  
明日香现在沉默了，她的脸仍然贴在真嗣的胸口上，没有意识到她和他的身体如此纠缠在一起。

"What...will we do now?" asked Asuka.  
“我们……现在做什么？”明日香问道。

"Lilith promised me something," said Shinji after a few seconds. "I don't know what it is, but if it can get rid of your pain..."  
“莉莉丝答应了我一件事。”几秒钟后真嗣说道。 “我不知道那是什么，但如果它能解除你的痛苦的话……”

"That would be nice," sighed Asuka.  
“那就太好了，”明日香叹息道。

Shinji smiled slightly, and wrapped his arms around her back, running his hands along it, pausing at the groves and tracing a line. Asuka shivered slightly at his touch, but let him continue on as he pleased. She didn't care that they were both naked right now, she only cared about this feeling that was running through her right now. But she was afraid that if Shinji let go, the pain of her memories would overtake her again.  
真嗣微微一笑，用双臂搂住她的背，用手抚过她的背，在树林处停下来，画出一条线。明日香在他的触碰下微微颤抖，但还是让他继续说下去。她不在乎他们现在都赤身裸体，她只在乎此刻流淌在她身上的这种感觉。但她害怕，如果真嗣放手，记忆中的痛苦会再次降临到她身上。

"Hey Shinji..." “喂，慎二……”

"Hmmm?" “嗯？”

"Do you still love me?"  
“你还爱我吗？”

Her question caught him off guard, and he paused with the stroking of her back. Did he still love Asuka? He always told himself that he did, but sometimes he didn't rightfully understand what love was, or if this was how it was supposed to feel.  
她的问题让他措手不及，他停了下来，抚摸着她的背。他还爱明日香吗？他总是告诉自己他做到了，但有时他并没有正确理解爱是什么，或者这是否应该是这样的感觉。

"I do," said Shinji slowly. "Though I don't understand it myself..."  
“我愿意。”真嗣缓缓说道。 “虽然我自己也不太明白……”

Asuka looked up at Shinji, a frown on her face.  
明日香抬头看着真嗣，脸上皱起了眉头。

"Do you really have to understand it?" wondered Asuka.  
“你真的必须明白吗？”明日香想知道。

"Huh?" “嗯？”

Letting out a low sigh, Asuka's breath tickled Shinji's chest, making him squirm. Asuka smiled slightly at this and said, "Love isn't something easily understood in the first place, something which I've realized recently. But if being around somebody makes you happy, shouldn't that be enough?"  
明日香低低地叹了口气，呼吸喷在真嗣的胸口，让他浑身蠕动。明日香闻言微微一笑，说道：“爱情本来就不是一件容易理解的事情，我最近才意识到这一点。但如果有人在身边能让你快乐，那不就足够了吗？”

Shinji looked at Asuka's face, feelings and emotions running through him which he had forgotten. Asuka was...had always been, somebody important to him, somebody that could never be replaced. If this was love...then-  
真嗣看着明日香的脸，他已经忘记了他的感受和情绪。明日香是……一直都是，一个对他来说很重要的人，一个永远无法取代的人。如果这就是爱……那么——

Shinji wrapped his arms around Asuka's back, and pulled her towards him, resting his forehead against hers as he did so. Asuka smiled slightly as she closed her eyes, enjoying the feel of closeness that radiated from herself and Shinji.  
真嗣用双臂搂住明日香的背，将她拉向自己，同时将额头抵在她的额头上。明日香微微一笑，闭上眼睛，享受着自己和真嗣散发出的亲密感。

"Hey Shinji...would it be selfish of me to do something?" asked Asuka quietly.  
“嘿，真嗣……我这样做会不会很自私？”明日香轻声问道。

Shinji opened his eyes and looked at her. Her eyes were open as well as she stared back at him; they were incredibly clear.  
真嗣睁开眼睛，看着她。她的眼睛睁着，也盯着他。他们非常清楚。

Shinji shook his head softly.  
慎二轻轻摇了摇头。

"Okay," mumbled Asuka as she leaned into him, pressing her breasts against his chest as she kissed him. Though momentarily caught off guard, Shinji let his own emotions take hold, and kissed Asuka back, projecting his love of her through the kiss.  
“好吧，”明日香低声说道，她靠向他，将乳房贴在他的胸前，亲吻他。尽管一时措手不及，真嗣还是控制住了自己的情绪，回吻了明日香，通过这个吻表达了他对她的爱。

They broke apart shortly, and stared back at each other. It had been painful, but they had been able to overcome that pain.  
很快他们就分开了，互相对视着。这很痛苦，但他们能够克服这种痛苦。

"Hey Shinji," mumbled Asuka as she cupped his face in her hands.  
“嘿真嗣，”明日香用手捧着他的脸，咕哝道。

"Yeah..." nodded Shinji. “嗯……”慎二点头。

Asuka leaned forward, and kissed him again, her lips overlapping with his, her warmth meshing with his. Shinji placed his arms behind her bare back, running his hands along it. Asuka shivered at his touch again, but continued kissing him. She wanted this, even if they forgot it. She wanted to feel Shinji like this at least once. The future was uncertain, so she wanted to enjoy this moment without worry about what was to come.  
明日香倾身向前，再次吻了他，她的嘴唇与他的嘴唇重叠，她的温暖与他的交融。真嗣将双臂放在她赤裸的背后，抚摸着她的背。明日香因他的触碰再次颤抖，但仍继续亲吻他。她想要这个，即使他们忘记了。她想至少有一次真嗣这样的感觉。未来是不确定的，所以她想享受这一刻，而不用担心即将发生的事情。

Asuka broke the kiss off first, and looked away from Shinji. Her cheeks were slightly pink, but looking out of the corner of her eye, she saw that Shinji's as well were pink. She chuckled a little at that.  
明日香率先结束了这个吻，并把目光从真嗣身上移开。她的脸颊微微泛着粉红色，但她用眼角的余光看到真嗣的脸颊也是粉红色的。说到这里她轻笑了一声。

'We are only fifteen years old after all,' thought Asuka. Hopefully though, there would be many more moments like this to come.  
“我们毕竟才十五岁，”明日香想。但希望以后还会有更多这样的时刻。

"...Asuka...uhh..." stuttered Shinji  
“……明日香……呃……”真嗣结结巴巴地说

"Hmmm?" asked Asuka with a raised eyebrow, regaining some of her flare.  
“嗯？”明日香扬起眉毛问道，她的怒火又恢复了一些。

"Sorry...just surprised is all."  
“抱歉……只是惊讶而已。”

"I told you it was selfish," said Asuka as she stood up and threw her arms above her head, stretching her body. Now that they weren't so close, Shinji wasn't able to look at her. Partly because Asuka was still naked, but partly because he was still embarrassed over what had happened.  
“我告诉过你这是自私的，”明日香站起来，将双臂举过头顶，伸展身体。现在距离不再那么近，真嗣无法看她。部分是因为明日香仍然赤身裸体，但部分是因为他仍然对所发生的事情感到尴尬。

"Is this still inside the Black Egg though?" asked Asuka as she looked around.  
“这还在黑蛋里面吗？”明日香环顾四周问道。

"Yes...but this is inside your mind," said Shinji as she sat up, his eyes still looking at the ground.  
“是的……但这是在你的脑海里，”真嗣坐起身说道，他的眼睛仍然看着地面。

"How are you here exactly then?"  
“那你怎么在这里？”

"AT-field," said Shinji simply.  
“AT-field，”真嗣简单地说。

"Then how exactly are we supposed to get out?"  
“那我们到底该怎么出去呢？”

"That would be your doing I'm guessing," said Shinji.  
“我猜那是你干的，”真嗣说。

Asuka looked over at him, and frowned, annoyed that he wasn't looking at her. All right, yes this was highly embarrassing, and yes they were both naked, but hadn't they both basically said they still loved each other?  
明日香看着他，皱起眉头，因为他没有看她而生气。好吧，是的，这非常尴尬，是的，他们都赤身裸体，但他们不是基本上都说他们仍然爱着对方吗？

"Well...I'll try," said Asuka.  
“嗯……我会尽力的，”明日香说道。

Asuka closed her eyes then and searched for her body within the sea of LCL fluid. It was difficult at first, but Asuka knowing who she was, found her body relatively quickly. That and the fact it was sectioned off from everybody else.  
明日香闭上眼睛，在拼箱液的海洋中寻找着自己的身体。一开始很难，但明日香知道她是谁，很快就找到了她的身体。事实是它与其他人隔离开来。

"Did you find it?" asked Shinji. He felt the plane they were in suddenly lose some of its foundation.  
“你找到了吗？”真嗣问道。他感觉他们所在的位面突然失去了一些根基。

"Yeah, I did," said Asuka as she walked over to him and held a hand out. Shinji wordlessly took it, still trying not to look directly at her.  
“是的，我做到了，”明日香走到他身边并伸出一只手说道。真嗣一言不发地接过它，仍然试图不直视她。

"See above then," said Asuka with a small smile.  
“那就看上面吧。”明日香微笑着说道。

"Yeah..." mumbled Shinji.  
“是啊……”真嗣咕哝道。

The white walls around them shattered, and darkness engulfed the two of them. At first, Shinji was surprised by this, but saw Asuka unaffected by it, and assumed everything was okay.  
周围的白色墙壁破碎，黑暗吞没了两人。起初，真嗣对此感到惊讶，但看到明日香没有受到影响，并认为一切都很好。

Shinji opened his eyes within the sea of orange LCL fluid and looked quickly down at the girl next to him. After several seconds, Asuka opened her eyes slowly, blinking as she looked up at Shinji.  
真嗣在橙色的拼箱液体海洋中睁开了眼睛，迅速低头看着身旁的女孩。几秒钟后，明日香缓缓睁开眼睛，眨着眼睛抬头看着真嗣。

"Is this it?" asked Asuka as she sat up.  
“是这个吗？”明日香坐起来问道。

"It is..." said Shinji. “这是……”真嗣说道。

"I'm starting to wish I stayed in there."  
“我开始希望我能呆在那里。”

Shinji didn't appreciate the joke. Asuka however looked down at her body, and quickly covered it; she was still naked. Darting her gaze towards Shinji, she looked at him annoyingly, since he still had clothes on.  
真嗣不喜欢这个玩笑。明日香却低头看了看自己的身体，赶紧捂住了自己的身体。她仍然赤身裸体。她的目光投向真嗣，恼怒地看着他，因为他还穿着衣服。

"How come I'm naked and you're not?"  
“为什么我是裸体的，而你却不是？”

"Probably because I came from the outside," said Shinji. "And you seemed fine before."  
“可能是因为我是从外面来的吧。”真嗣说道。 “而且你之前看起来还不错。”

'Because you were naked also,' thought Asuka wordlessly.  
“因为你也赤身裸体。”明日香无言地想。

"Well...whatever. Lets get out of there. I want to see Lilith-"  
“好吧……无论如何。我们离开那里吧。我想见莉莉丝——”

Pain hit Asuka's heart as her memories caught up with her. Flashes of everything seared her mind so that she was forced to clutch her head in agony.  
当她的记忆追上她时，明日香的心感到疼痛。眼前的一切一幕幕闪过，让她的心灼痛不已，她不得不痛苦地抱住头。

"Asuka!" shouted Shinji. “飞鸟！”真嗣喊道。

Rushing to her side, he gripped her shoulders and held her against his chest. She was shaking uncontrollably.  
他冲到她身边，抓住她的肩膀，将她按在自己的胸前。她无法控制地颤抖着。

"Shinji...it hurts," Asuka groaned as tears started leaking from her eyes.  
“真嗣……好痛。”明日香呻吟着，泪水从她的眼中流淌出来。

'Damn it,' thought Shinji. Asuka's mind still wasn't able to cope with the new memories. Everything contradicted everything else so that she didn't know what was right anymore. And the rape...Shinji knew this is what tormented Asuka the most. Having to remember the feeling of it must have been too terrible.  
“该死，”真嗣想。明日香的大脑仍然无法应对新的记忆。一切都互相矛盾，让她不知道什么才是正确的。还有强奸……真嗣知道这才是最让明日香痛苦的事情。必须记住那种感觉一定太可怕了。

'But Lilith should be able to help,' Shinji told himself.  
“但是莉莉丝应该能够帮忙，”真嗣告诉自己。

"C'mon on Asuka. I'll guide you out."  
“来吧明日香。我带你出去。”

Asuka sniffed slightly and pressed her head against Shinji's chest, uncaring now that she was naked.  
明日香轻轻吸了吸鼻子，把头靠在真嗣的胸口上，毫不在意她赤身裸体。

Shinji continued moving forward through the stream of LCL fluid, carrying Asuka in his arms as he went, holding onto her dearly. Asuka was silent, but she was still shaking in Shinji's arms. Shinji didn't know what he was supposed to say to her, or how to even comfort her right now. He could try to alter her memories with his AT-field he supposed, but nothing good would likely come of that.  
真嗣继续在拼箱液流中前进，边走边抱着明日香，紧紧地抱住她。明日香沉默了，但她在真嗣的怀里仍然颤抖着。真嗣现在不知道自己该对她说什么，甚至不知道该如何安慰她。他认为他可以尝试用他的 AT 场改变她的记忆，但这样做不太可能有什么好处。

No, it was only Lilith that he could rely on right now.  
不，现在他能依靠的只有莉莉丝。

---

After what felt like hours, Shinji finally broke free of the Black Egg. The last stretch had surprised him however, as nobody tried to impede them. He suspected that Lilith might have had something to do with this.  
过了好几个小时，真嗣终于挣脱了黑蛋。然而最后一段让他感到惊讶，因为没有人试图阻止他们。他怀疑这件事可能与莉莉丝有关。

His body was of course still resting inside Unit 01, providing the equation to Third Impact, so this was where he was transported to after he broke free of the Egg. He felt his mind slowly float down into his body, but only one thing was missing.  
当然，他的身体仍在01号单元内，为第三次冲击提供了方程式，所以这就是他挣脱蛋后被传送到的地方。他感觉自己的神识慢慢飘落到体内，却唯独少了一样东西。

"Asuka?" asked Shinji. “明日香？”真嗣问道。

She had returned there with him. But he had been sure that she had been with him when he-  
她和他一起回到了那里。但他确信她一直在他身边，当他——

"I have her here with me Shinji," came Lilith's voice from around him.  
“我让她和我在一起，真嗣，”莉莉丝的声音从他身边传来。

"Lilith, if you do anything to harm Asuka, I swear."  
“莉莉丝，如果你做了任何伤害明日香的事，我发誓。”

"Relax, I wont harm her in any way. I just want to talk with you for now, about what happens now. I've put her mind at rest momentarily so she doesn't have to deal with the pain however."  
“放心，我不会以任何方式伤害她。我现在只想和你谈谈，谈谈现在发生的事情。我已经让她暂时安息了，这样她就不用承受痛苦了。”

"Fine, I'm coming over," said Shinji.  
“好吧，我这就过去。”真嗣说道。

Leaving his mind, he traveled to the Garden of Eden, and felt his feet slam down on the white soil there. He was standing in front of the Tree of Life. He stared at it for several seconds, looking at its withered state before he turned towards the two people beside it. Asuka was laying on the ground, breathing deeply as she rested. Shinji almost wished that things could stay like that forever, that Asuka wouldn't have to feel anymore pain. But such a thing was impossible.  
他抛开思绪，来到了伊甸园，感觉自己的脚踩在了那里的白色泥土上。他站在生命之树前。他盯着它看了几秒，看着它枯萎的样子，这才转向旁边的两人。明日香躺在地上，深呼吸着休息。真嗣几乎希望事情能永远这样下去，明日香再也不用感到痛苦了。但这样的事是不可能的。

Turning towards the person beside her, he looked at Lilith for a few seconds. She was looking down at Asuka with a curious expression on her face, something which reminded Shinji of Rei momentarily.  
他转头看向身边的人，看了莉莉丝几秒。她低头看着明日香，脸上带着好奇的表情，这让真嗣瞬间想起了丽。

"You found her," said Lilith simply.  
“你找到了她，”莉莉丝简单地说。

"There was never a moment when I didn't think I would," said Shinji.  
“我从来没有想过我会这么做，”真嗣说。

Lilith turned towards him and said, "But you were also a bit late. She remember things that her already weakened mind was not able to take, and without you there, she faded away. Though she is sleeping peacefully now, if she were to wake up, that pain would still be there."  
莉莉丝转头看向他，道：“不过你也来晚了一些，她已经记不清了，她本就虚弱的心智无法承受，没有你在，她就渐渐消失了。虽然她现在睡得很安稳，但如果她醒醒吧，疼痛依然存在。”

"But you said there was something you could do."  
“但你说过你可以做点什么。”

"I did, but I must first ask you Shinji about the circumstances of which you will be thrown in. I told you already that the world will be as it is for several years until the planet starts to regrow. If humans leave things untouched for a time, it will speed up the process. Not every human will return of course, some desiring the false reality, and they can become enamored in it for all I care. That is there decision. But humans will return nonetheless."  
“是的，但我必须先问你，真嗣，你将被扔进什么样的环境。我已经告诉过你，世界将在数年之内保持原样，直到地球开始重新生长。如果人类不去碰触一切，当然，并不是每个人都会回归，有些人渴望虚假的现实，他们可能会迷恋它，但这就是我所关心的决定，但人类仍然会回归。”

"As for you and Asuka...it seems impossible to separate you. Whether you have your memories in tact or not, you two still sot each other out. I don't believe it is a thing that can be prevented, but I can alleviate your pain to some degree, as I am partially to blame because of that pain."  
“至于你和明日香……似乎不可能分开。无论你们的记忆是否完整，你们两个人还是在互相较量。我不认为这是可以阻止的事情，但我可以在某种程度上减轻你的痛苦，因为我对这种痛苦负有部分责任。”

"Shinji, as you know, Adam created the bodies of you humans, and I created your AT-field, everything that incorporates a person. There personality, thoughts, and memories, they all make up who a person is. The angels each had a power, and Adam and myself being the forerunners had powers of creation. I created things more abstract, while Adam created things more physical. The AT-fields are an example of this. They are impossible to see or feel by normal humans, but they exist nonetheless."  
“真嗣，如你所知，亚当创造了你们人类的身体，而我创造了你们的 AT 场，以及包含一个人的一切。有个性、思想和记忆，它们都构成了一个人。每个天使都有亚当和我自己是先驱者，我创造了更抽象的事物，而亚当创造了更物理的事物，AT 场就是一个例子，它们是普通人无法看到或感觉到的。尽管如此，它们仍然存在。”

"Shinji...though you and Asuka love each other, you both unknowingly hurt each other and were hurt by the things around you, and this is no more apparent then with what Asuka is dealing with right now. If she had never met you, would she ever have experience those things? The same for you; if you had never met Asuka, would you ever have discovered your angel powers and the fact that you are Adam's son? All these things hurt you however, even if they are the truth, for the truth usually hurts."  
“真嗣……虽然你和明日香彼此相爱，但你们都在不知不觉中互相伤害，并被周围的事物所伤害，而这一点在明日香现在所面对的情况下就更不明显了。如果她从未见过你的话，她会经历这些事情吗？如果你从未见过明日香，你会发现你的天使力量和你是亚当的儿子这一事实，即使它们是亚当的儿子？真相，因为真相通常会带来伤害。”

"I'm sorry for everything that I've done, and as I said, I am partially to blame. I showed you how to control your powers, I nudged you along the way, hoping that things would fall into place as they did. But still, you rejected me, you rejected Instrumentality, you rejected the false reality, all for the girl that you love, even though you were uncertain about that love. That girl replied in turn, loving you as you loved her. But the pain of everything will still exist, even with that love there."  
“我对我所做的一切感到抱歉，正如我所说，我也有部分责任。我向你展示了如何控制你的力量，我一路上推动着你，希望事情能像他们所做的那样顺利进行。但你仍然拒绝了我，你拒绝了工具性，你拒绝了虚假的现实，这一切都是为了你所爱的女孩，尽管你不确定那个女孩反过来爱你，就像你爱她一样。即使有那样的爱，一切的痛苦仍然存在。”

"I've decided that I'll help you and Asuka in this regard however, and erase all your memories of each other."  
“不过，我决定在这方面帮助你们和明日香，并抹去你们关于彼此的所有记忆。”

Shinji was silent, thinking that he had heard wrong. Erase there memories of each other? Something like that was...but he cherished those memories he had of Asuka. He didn't want to lose them!  
真嗣沉默了，以为自己听错了。抹去彼此的记忆？类似的事情是……但他很珍惜与明日香有关的那些回忆。他不想失去他们！

"Lilith...that is-" 「莉莉丝……那是——」

"Something which you can't agree with?" asked Lilith.  
“有什么事情你不能同意吗？”莉莉丝问道。

"Of course! I just got Asuka back, and now you say that we should just forget about each other completely? Bullshit!"  
“当然！我刚把明日香带回来，你却说我们应该彻底忘记对方？胡扯！”

"Shinji, think about it this way. Those memories will forever be ingrained in your mind. You are strong, and that is largely thanks to your angel prowess, but Asuka is still human, and having memories from two completely separate moments in her life will torment her until she wont know which one is truly her."  
“真嗣，这样想吧。那些记忆将永远在你的脑海中根深蒂固。你很坚强，这很大程度上要归功于你的天使力量，但明日香仍然是人类，她拥有生命中两个完全不同时刻的记忆会折磨她，直到她分不清哪个才是真正的她。”

"But-" “但-”

"This is all I can do Shinji. It is the only way to take care of Asuka's pain. And you yourself are in pain, even if you don't want to admit it. You locked many things away inside you, but if those were to spill forth suddenly, your rage and anger may break people dear to you. Do you want that?"  
“这就是真嗣所能做的一切。这是解决明日香痛苦的唯一方法。而你自己也很痛苦，即使你不想承认。你把很多东西锁在心里，但如果那些东西如果突然爆发，你的愤怒和愤怒可能会伤害你所爱的人，你愿意吗？”

"No, but-" “不是，但-”

Lilith shook her head and looked down at Asuka.  
莉莉丝摇摇头，低头看着明日香。

"I spoke to her briefly before you arrived here, and told her about my offer. She, like you was hesitant, but I think she believed as I do that even if your memories of each other no longer exist, the love for each other will still remain. Memories may disappear and fade, but the body remembers a person important to it. You and Asuka connected on a level few humans are able to, and even though you are both at such a young age, you were both able to recognize each for who they were. Many humans, and even couples are unable to do this, and don't understand what the other is really thinking. But you and Asuka aren't like that."  
“在你到达这里之前，我和她简短地交谈过，告诉她我的提议。她和你一样犹豫不决，但我想她和我一样相信，即使你们彼此的记忆不再存在，对彼此的爱仍然存在。”记忆可能会消失和褪色，但身体会记住一个对它来说很重要的人，而你和明日香的联系程度是人类无法企及的，尽管你们都那么年轻，但你们都能够做到。许多人类，甚至情侣都做不到这一点，也不明白对方的真实想法，但你和明日香不是这样的。”

"So then...she agreed to it?"  
“那么……她就同意了？”

"Only if you do," replied Lilith. "Ultimately, it has to be both your decisions."  
“只要你愿意，”莉莉丝回答道。 “最终，这必须是你们两个的决定。”

Shinji's eyes moved towards Asuka momentarily gazing at her longingly.  
真嗣的目光移向明日香，一时充满渴望地注视着她。

"Lilith...if I agree to this...what about the other humans. What will happen to them?"  
“莉莉丝……如果我同意了……其他人类呢？他们会怎么样？”

Lilith paused for a brief second and thought about this.  
莉莉丝停顿了一下，思考了这个问题。

"For a time, I shall keep them within the Black Egg until I deem the time ready for the Lilim's rebirth. During that time, you and Asuka will be able to live alone, free from any turmoil. I can give you several years to grow with each other."  
“我会把他们暂时留在黑蛋里，直到我认为莉莉姆重生的时机已经成熟。在那段时间里，你和明日香将能够单独生活，不受任何动乱。我可以给你几年的时间。互相成长。”

"And what of my angel powers? Can you do anything about those?"  
“那我的天使力量呢？你能做点什么吗？”

Lilith's face fell slightly, as she remembered the conversation she had had with Rei.  
想起和雷的对话，莉莉丝的脸色微微沉了下来。

"Unfortunately Shinji, I can't do anything about that, nor could Adam even. You born from Adam and human, and were given the powers of an angel. I don't have any say in the matter. You are you are and will forever be. Even if you memories are gone, that part of you still remains."  
“不幸的是，真嗣，我对此无能为力，甚至亚当也无能为力。你是亚当和人类所生，并被赋予了天使的力量。我在这件事上没有任何发言权。你是你是，即使你的记忆消失了，那部分的你仍然存在。”

"...I see," said Shinji. “……我明白了，”真嗣说道。

Lilith watched Shinji, wondering if she should voice her opinion on the subject, but her and Rei had already talked about that. It wasn't there place to interfere.  
莉莉丝看着真嗣，想知道她是否应该就这个话题发表自己的看法，但她和丽已经谈过了。没有地方可以干涉。

"Then you agree to this?" asked Lilith.  
“那你同意这个吗？”莉莉丝问道。

Shinji once again looked over Asuka; he nodded his head slowly.  
真嗣再次看向明日香。他缓缓地点点头。

"Okay," said Lilith. “好吧，”莉莉丝说。

Standing up, she walked over to Shinji and placed a hand of hers on his head.  
她站起来，走到真嗣身边，将一只手放在他的头上。

"One last thing Lilith...what will you do after this? What will you and Ayanami do?"  
「莉莉丝最后一件事……之后你会做什么？你和绫波会做什么？」

"...I thought about your words, and have decided to search for Adam. He's out there somewhere, and seeing you and Asuka reminded me of times I'd all but forgotten. I'll hold onto the hope that we can become one again. But for the time being, I'll watch over the earth until the Lilim return. Afterwards...well, I'll worry about that when the time comes."  
“......我考虑了你的话，并决定寻找亚当。他就在外面的某个地方，看到你和明日香让我想起了我几乎忘记的那些时光。我会坚持希望我们能够成为但暂时，我会守护地球直到莉莉姆回来……好吧，到时候我会担心的。”

Lilith smiled slightly at Shinji, who couldn't help but smile back.  
莉莉丝对真嗣微微一笑，真嗣也忍不住笑了笑。

"Its been enjoyable seeing you grow into the person you are today," said Lilith. "I wish you and Asuka all the best."  
“看到你成长为今天的样子，我很高兴，”莉莉丝说。 “祝你和明日香一切顺利。”

Lilith then lightly tapped Shinji on the forehead, and whiteness immediately engulfed his mind.  
莉莉丝轻轻拍了拍真嗣的额头，真嗣的脑海立刻一片惨白。

---

At first, Shinji thought that he was inside Asuka's mind again, but as he noticed, things were slightly different. Though everything was white, there was a distinct outline of a wooden bench in the middle of the plane.  
起初，真嗣以为自己又进入了明日香的脑海，但当他注意到时，情况略有不同。虽然一切都是白色的，但飞机的正中央却有着清晰的木凳轮廓。

As Shinji started walking towards it, he felt a light tap on the back of his shoulder and jumped immensely. Spinning around, he saw Asuka standing there, a wide grin on her face. She was wearing her plug suit, and looking down at himself, Shinji noticed that he was wearing his as well.  
当真嗣开始朝它走去时，他感到肩膀后面被轻轻拍了一下，然后跳了起来。转过身来，他看到明日香站在那里，脸上挂着灿烂的笑容。她穿着她的紧身衣，低头看着自己，真嗣发现他也穿着他的。

"Jump easily, don't you?" laughed Asuka as she teased him.  
“跳起来很轻松，不是吗？”明日香嘲笑他时笑道。

"What was that for?" “那是干什么用的？”

"Just felt like it," said Asuka as she walked past him. Sitting down on the bench, she patted the spot beside her, indicating that she wanted him to sit next to her. Shinji did so, glancing sideways at her as she did so. Asuka threw her hands behind the bench and stretched her feet out.  
“只是感觉就像这样，”明日香从他身边走过时说道。坐在长凳上，她拍了拍身边的位置，示意他坐到自己身边。真嗣这样做了，同时侧眼看了她一眼。明日香把手放到长凳后面，伸出双脚。

"Ah, it feels good to be wearing a plug suit again."  
“啊，又穿上插头套装了，感觉真好。”

"Says you," mumbled Shinji.  
“你说。”真嗣咕哝道。

"You never did enjoy using the Evangelions."  
“你从来都不喜欢使用新世纪福音战士。”

"And you did?" “你做到了？”

"Well, it was always someplace I could go...and Mama was there of course," said Asuka. "Though of course, meeting you messed that up completely."  
“嗯，总有一个我可以去的地方……当然，妈妈也在那儿，”明日香说。 “当然，遇见你让事情完全搞砸了。”

"Do you regret that?" “你后悔吗？”

"Not at all," said Asuka as she turned and looked at Shinji. "Meeting you was the best thing that has ever happened to me."  
“一点也不。”明日香转身看着真嗣说道。 “遇见你是我这辈子发生过的最好的事情。”

Shinji stared back at her, amazed that she had said such words.  
真嗣回头看着她，很惊讶她会说出这样的话。

"I mean, who else is always going to cook my meals," laughed Asuka.  
“我的意思是，还有谁会一直给我做饭呢？”明日香笑着说。

Shinji sighed; he should have known better than to expected anything else.  
真嗣叹了口气；他应该比预期更清楚地知道其他事情。

But all too suddenly, Asuka's head tilted sideways onto Shinji's shoulder.  
但突然间，明日香的头侧向真嗣的肩膀。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

"...Will you hold me Shinji?" Asuka whispered through half closed lips.  
「……你能抱抱我吗？」明日香半闭着嘴唇低声说道。

Shinji did so, wrapping an arm around Asuka's shoulder and pulling her close to himself. He then rest his chin on the top of her head and nuzzled it against her silky hair.  
真嗣这样做了，用一只手臂搂住明日香的肩膀，将她拉近自己。然后他将下巴抵在她的头顶上，用鼻子蹭着她柔滑的头发。

"Shinji...I'm scared about the future. Did we make the right decision?"  
“真嗣……我对未来感到害怕。我们做出了正确的决定吗？”

Shinji looked down at Asuka, and saw her eyes wide with fear. He didn't want such an emotion to ever pass through her once again. So-  
真嗣低头看着明日香，看到她的眼睛里充满了恐惧。他不想让这样的情绪再次在她身上流过。所以-

"The pain will be gone," said Shinji as he brushed his lips against her hair.  
“疼痛会消失的，”真嗣一边说，一边用嘴唇拂过她的头发。

"But will we be...will we be able to love each other again?"  
“但是我们……我们还能再次相爱吗？”

Shinji drew his head away from her. Resting his hand on her chin, he tilted her chin upwards so that she was looking at him.  
真嗣把头从她身上移开。他把手放在她的下巴上，抬起她的下巴，让她看着他。

"For us, such a thing is always possible."  
“对我们来说，这样的事情总是有可能的。”

Shinji then leaned down and kissed Asuka sweetly. Even if he forgot, it didn't matter. He wanted this to be the last thing they remembered together.  
真嗣俯下身子，甜蜜地吻住了明日香。就算他忘记了，也没关系。他希望这是他们一起记得的最后一件事。

As Shinji and Asuka broke apart, a bright light from somewhere in the far distance shot outward. Shinji noticed the space they were in start to disappear, almost like when he had left Asuka's mind. But it was fading away, almost like a millions feathers floating in the wind.  
当真嗣和明日香分开时，一道明亮的光芒从远处的某处射出。真嗣注意到他们所在的空间开始消失，就像他离开明日香的脑海一样。但它正在消失，几乎就像数百万根羽毛在风中飘扬。

Shinji wrapped his arms around Asuka then, hugging her tightly. If things were gonna disappear like this, he wanted them to be-  
真嗣伸手搂住明日香，紧紧地拥抱着她。如果事情就这样消失，他希望它们——

"Huh?" “嗯？”

Shinji sat alone on the bench, his arms wrapped around empty space.  
真嗣独自坐在长凳上，双臂环抱着空地。

'What was I?' he wondered.  
“我是什么？”他想知道。

Then the whiteness engulfed him as it had engulfed Asuka.  
然后白色吞没了他，就像吞没了明日香一样。

Lilith sat alone under the Tree of Life. Both Shinji and Asuka lay side by side in an almost comatose like state.  
莉莉丝独自坐在生命之树下。真嗣和明日香并肩躺着，几乎处于昏迷状态。

'Well, things can now progress as they wish,' thought Lilith as she let out a low sigh. Placing a hand over both Shinji's and Asuka's body, she moved them from the Garden of Eden, to the ruins of Tokyo-3 below.  
“好吧，现在事情可以如他们所愿地发展了。”莉莉丝低声叹了一口气。她将一只手放在真嗣和明日香的身上，将他们从伊甸园移至下方的第三东京废墟。

'Now comes the difficult part,' sighed Lilith. Without Shinji's body, Third Impact would crumble away. Even though the Black Egg would remain in tact, she now had to focus all her power into putting humanity to sleep.  
“现在困难的部分来了，”莉莉丝叹了口气。没有真嗣的身体，第三次冲击就会崩溃。尽管黑蛋完好无损，但她现在必须集中所有力量让人类陷入沉睡。

'I suppose I've got my work cut out for me,' thought Lilith. Turning back to the Tree of Life, she stared at it one final time. But she noticed something then.  
“我想我的工作已经完成了，”莉莉丝想。她转回生命之树，最后一次凝视它。但随后她注意到了一些事情。

"Hmph, Adam and Eve huh?"  
“哼，亚当和夏娃啊？”

Two sprouts had appeared on the Tree of Life's withered branches.  
生命之树枯萎的枝条上，已经长出了两根新芽。

'Well, its in there hands now,' thought Lilith.  
“好吧，现在它就在那儿了，”莉莉丝想。

Afterwards, she disappeared from that place, never again to return in any shape or form.  
之后，她就从那个地方消失了，再也没有以任何形式出现过。
