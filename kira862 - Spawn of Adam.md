**Well I finally got around to posting my story of Evangelion. So here is the first chapter. One of the things that made NGE so interesting was the relationships between the characters. Though it was also because of the psychological aspects which made in interesting to me. I try to stick close to the core of what made it interesting by having the characters question themselves in their own minds and of course developing the love-hate relationship of Shinji and Asuka. And without further ado I give you Spawn of Adam.  
好吧，我终于抽出时间来发布我的《福音战士》故事了。以下是第一章。《新世纪福音战士》之所以引人入胜，其中一个原因在于角色之间的关系。当然，心理层面的描绘也让我觉得它非常有趣。我试图紧扣使其有趣的本质，让角色们在内心深处自我质疑，并自然地发展出真嗣和明日香之间爱恨交织的关系。废话不多说，现在就为您呈现《亚当的子嗣》。**

**Update: 12/26/14.  更新日期：12/26/14。**

**So I've long known that Spawn of Adam has its fair share of problems, from its many grammatical errors, to the early interactions between Shinji and Asuka being somewhat out of place compared to how things started to take shape. With that said, I'm gonna begin re-uploading each chapter, fixing mistakes, and overall rewriting some stuff. In this chapter in particular I've completely changed the first interaction between them so that Asuka's been toned way down compared to how she initially acted.  
我早就知道《亚当的子嗣》存在不少问题，从诸多语法错误，到真嗣和明日香早期的互动与后来逐渐成形的情节相比显得有些突兀。话虽如此，我打算开始重新上传每一章，修正错误，并整体上重写一些内容。特别是这一章，我彻底改变了他们第一次互动的情节，让明日香的行为比最初的表现要收敛得多。**

Shinji Ikari looked out the window from where he sat in his homeroom class. It had been raining for close to a week now, and the rain depicted what his mood felt like right now: miserable. Shinji had never cared much for a social life and shunned people away when they got to close to him. He preferred to sit in class and listen to his SDAT while the teacher ran through the normal, boring routine of lecturing without pause. His teacher had gotten tired of having to put up with Shinji's constant absences, and him not paying attention in class and just acted like his seat was empty. Shinji didn't care anymore whether he wanted him there or not. He just came to school and slept whenever his roommate at home became too much of a pain in the ass to deal with.  
碇真嗣坐在教室里，目光投向窗外。雨已经下了将近一周，这雨正如他此刻的心情：凄凉。真嗣向来不热衷于社交生活，每当有人试图靠近，他便避之不及。他更愿意坐在教室里，听着 SDAT，任由老师无休止地进行那枯燥乏味的讲课。他的老师早已厌倦了真嗣频繁的缺席和课堂上心不在焉的态度，仿佛他的座位空无一人。真嗣已不再在乎老师是否希望他留在那里。他来学校只是为了逃避，每当家里的室友变得难以忍受时，他就在课堂上打盹。

Shinji sighed and continued to look out the window. He had received an envelope this morning from his father stating that he would be moving the next day. That was one reason why Shinji never had a social life. His father who worked at the Nerv facilities somewhere in Tokyo-3, constantly kept his son moving from apartment to apartment not letting him stay in the same place very long. Shinji hated his father for this, and the fact that he hadn't even seen him for over a year. His father had abandoned him to go work on his stupid Nerv projects, 'Whatever those were,' thought Shinji.  
真嗣叹了口气，继续望向窗外。今早他收到了父亲的一封信，说明天就要搬家了。这也是真嗣从未有过社交生活的原因之一。在东京-3 某处 NERV 设施工作的父亲，不断让儿子从一个公寓搬到另一个公寓，不让他长时间待在同一个地方。真嗣为此憎恨父亲，更因为已经超过一年没见过他了。父亲为了那些愚蠢的 NERV 项目抛弃了他，“管它是什么呢，”真嗣心想。

He continued to look out the window when he heard the bell ring, signaling the start of lunch. 'God damn this day,' he thought. 'I wish it would just hurry up and be over with so I can go to my next home. I can just hope that it'll be better than what I'm stuck with now.'  
他继续望着窗外，这时铃声响起，标志着午餐时间的开始。“该死的今天，”他心想，“真希望它能快点结束，这样我就可以去下一个家了。我只希望它比我现在被困的地方要好。”

He was the last one to get up from his chair and walked swiftly past the teacher as he shot Shinji a scowl. 'Don't even think he bothered to write my name down on the register. Though it doesn't matter now. I'm leaving so I won't be seeing him any more.'  
他是最后一个从椅子上站起来的人，迅速走过老师身边，老师对真嗣投以怒视。“他甚至可能都没在名册上写下我的名字。不过现在无所谓了。我要离开了，不会再见到他了。”

---

Leaving the school grounds, he suddenly wished he would have just stayed put. Within minutes of exiting the school, he was soaked to the bone and his clothes felt like they were weighing him down a few extra pounds.  
离开学校后，他突然希望自己刚才没有动。刚走出校门几分钟，他就被淋得浑身湿透，衣服感觉像是重了几磅，压得他喘不过气来。

Shinji however didn't want to go home, or what he called a home right now. Later, he would get back, pack up, and simply wait for tomorrow to come. He didn't feel like facing his roommate right now. This morning they had gotten into a shouting match over last nights party that had been held. Shinji had come back from strolling the streets of Tokyo-3 to find his room a mess, empty bear bottles littering the floor, and the smell of vomit lingering. Worst of all, he was stuck disinfecting the whole place, and now just this morning he found out he was leaving.  
然而，真嗣并不想回家，或者说他现在称之为家的地方。晚些时候，他会回去收拾行李，然后简单地等待明天的到来。他现在不想面对他的室友。今早他们因为昨晚的派对吵了起来。真嗣从东京-3 的街头漫步回来，发现房间一片狼藉，满地都是空啤酒瓶，呕吐物的气味挥之不去。最糟糕的是，他不得不负责整个地方的消毒工作，而现在就在今早，他得知自己要离开了。

'Should have left the idiot to clean the mess up himself,' he thought bitterly.  
“早知道就让那傻瓜自己收拾烂摊子了。”他苦涩地想。

Most of his time spent in Tokyo-3, he had taken long walks through the streets and alleyways and he knew the place so well that he could close his eyes and walk by memory. It was one way that he used to escape the reality that he was facing. With his SDAT in hand, he would walk aimlessly through Tokyo until he found a suitable spot to fall asleep. He almost wished that his father would just let him sleep outside. At least he was more content this way.  
在东京-3 度过的多数时光里，他常常漫步于街道和巷弄之间，对这片地方了如指掌，甚至闭上眼睛也能凭记忆行走。这是他逃避现实的一种方式。手持 SDAT，他会漫无目的地穿梭于东京，直到找到一个合适的角落入睡。他几乎希望父亲能让他睡在外面，至少这样他更感满足。

He walked aimlessly for hours until he arrive at a spot that he visited often. He had arrived at the Bay of Tokyo and looked towards the sun which was just starting to set. It was stuff like this that brought him into his own world. Watching the sun, he could forget about everything and just watch until it set. Then, though he would be forced back to the sharp reality that was his life and plunged into his own misery again. 'Its not like its my fault that I'm miserable. All my father ever does is shun me from place to place.'  
他漫无目的地走了几个小时，直到来到一个常去的地方。他来到了东京湾，望着太阳刚刚开始西沉。正是这样的景象让他沉浸在自己的世界里。凝视着夕阳，他可以忘却一切，只是静静地看着它落下。然而，每当太阳沉没，他又会被迫回到那尖锐的现实生活，再次陷入自己的痛苦之中。'我这么痛苦又不是我的错。父亲总是把我从一个地方赶到另一个地方。'

'Ah, but its your decision not to connect with people,' said a small voice in his head.  
'啊，但与人建立联系是你自己的选择，'他脑海中有个细小的声音说道。

'I never get a chance though. I rarely stay at the same school for three months. How the hell am I supposed to connect with people and then stay in contact with them if I move around so much?'  
“但我从未有机会。我很少在一所学校待满三个月。如果我总是四处搬家，我怎么可能与人建立联系并保持联系呢？”

The voice didn't respond as though admitting defeat.  
那个声音没有回应，仿佛承认了失败。

Shinji now laid back against the grassy shore and looked up into the sky, or what he could see of it. Many building towered over him and their tall peaks made it difficult for him to see much of the sky. He felt like they were pressing down around him. 'Damn this city,' he thought. 'There is nothing to do except get drunk, according to my roommate.' Even Shinji had to smile at that thought. 'Probably bending over the toilet right now and feeling his dinner coming up.'  
真嗣现在背靠在草地上，抬头望向天空，或者说他能看到的那部分天空。许多建筑物高耸在他周围，它们的尖顶使得他很难看到更多的天空。他感觉它们像是在他周围压迫下来。‘该死的这座城市，’他想，‘除了喝醉，我的室友说这里什么都没有。’就连真嗣想到这一点也不禁微笑。‘现在大概正弯着腰对着马桶，感受着晚餐涌上来吧。’

Shinji would have liked to continue laying their until the sun finally set but willed himself to get up. Even though he hated his roommate he thought it appropriate to tell him that he would be leaving tomorrow. Pushing himself up into a sitting position he gave one final look at the sun before he turned to go, but then did a double take.  
真嗣本想继续躺着直到太阳最终落下，但还是强迫自己起身。尽管他讨厌室友，他觉得还是应该告诉他明天自己要离开。他用力坐起身，在转身离开前最后看了一眼夕阳，却突然愣住了。

He wasn't sure how long they had been there, but someone was down by the water looking out across the ocean. Shinji squinted his eyes trying to make out who could be down there. Standing up he looked again and saw that it was a girl and she must have been close to his age. She had long red hair that came down to the middle of her back, and her hair was separating into three parts thanks to the hair clips that she wore. She was wearing a simple yellow dress that was blowing against the wind. The contrast between herself and the setting sun in front of her was almost blinding. It was almost as though that fiery red hair and sun dress magnified herself and the sun so that she gave off an eerie orange glow. Shinji wasn't sure what made him do it but he stood there for sometime watching the back of her. He had a sudden urge to go down there and find out who she was, but then shook his head.  
他不确定他们在那里待了多久，但有人在水边眺望着大海。真嗣眯起眼睛试图辨认出那会是谁。他站起来再次望去，发现那是个女孩，年龄应该和他相仿。她有着一头长长的红发，垂至背部中间，发丝因佩戴的发夹而分成三股。她穿着一件简单的黄色连衣裙，随风飘扬。她与前方夕阳的对比几乎令人目眩。仿佛那火红的头发和太阳裙将她与太阳放大，散发出一种诡异的橙色光芒。真嗣不确定是什么驱使他这样做，但他站在那里凝视着她的背影。他突然有种冲动想走下去，弄清楚她是谁，但随即摇了摇头。

"No point," he said softly. "Tomorrow I'll be gone again so theres no point in finding out who she is."  
“没意义，”他轻声说，“明天我又将离开，所以没必要知道她是谁。”

Giving her back one last look he turned and walked back towards his soon to be old apartment. Though the thought of the setting sun and her was constantly on his mind for the rest of the night.  
最后看了一眼她的背影，他转身走回即将成为旧公寓的地方。尽管夕阳和她一直萦绕在他的脑海中，直到深夜。

---

Shinji woke up the next morning and waited outside his roommates door. When he had come home last night he had found him sleeping on the couch passed out. Deciding that he would just wait till the next morning, he had packed what little things he owned, and went to sleep.  
第二天早上，真嗣醒来后便站在室友的房门外等候。昨晚回家时，他发现室友醉倒在沙发上睡着了。决定等到第二天早上再说，他收拾了自己仅有的几样东西，便去睡了。

Now he was leaning against his roommates door with his bag in his hand waiting for him to get up. Shinji sighed and looked down at his watch. He was supposed to meet this Misato Katsuragi in the next few hours. Shinji frowned at the name of this unidentified person. From the sound of it she was a women, and Shinji hadn't had a woman as a roommate, yet.  
现在，他倚靠在室友的房门上，手里提着包，等待对方起床。真嗣叹了口气，低头看了看手表。他应该在接下来的几个小时内与这位葛城美里见面。真嗣对这个未曾谋面的人的名字皱了皱眉。听起来她是个女性，而真嗣还从未与女性同住过。

'Well, anything is probably better than what I'm stuck with right now,' he thought.  
“嗯，不管怎样，总比我现在的情况要好吧，”他心想。

Sighing again he slumped down into a sitting position and leaned his head against the door.  
他又叹了口气，颓然坐下，将头靠在门上。

'Ah hurry the hell up, he thought. 'I wanna get this over with.'  
'啊，快点吧，'他心想，'我想赶紧结束这事。'

Shinji wasn't sure how long he sat there waiting for his roommate to wake up, but it must have been at least half an hour. Feeling that he was starting to get drowsy from sitting there for so long, he stood up and turned to face the door. 'Enough. I'm getting his ass up.'  
真嗣不确定自己坐在那里等室友醒来有多久了，但至少有半个小时。感觉自己因为坐得太久而开始犯困，他站起身来，转向门。'够了。我要把他叫起来。'

He swung the door open about to tell his roommate to get the hell up. He was shocked to see that the bed was empty and seemed to have been for several hours.  
他猛地推开门，正准备叫室友起床。却惊讶地发现床上空无一人，似乎已经离开好几个小时了。

"What the hell. This is the first time I've known him to get up early."  
“搞什么鬼。这是我第一次知道他早起。”

Shinji looked at his watch again and knew that he wouldn't be able to tell him in person.  
真嗣再次看了看手表，知道无法当面告诉他了。

"I guess I'll just leave him a note telling him I've left. I'm sure he wont care. He's been talking about having his girlfriend start sleeping over."  
"我想我会给他留张字条，告诉他我已经走了。我肯定他不会在乎的。他一直在说要让他的女朋友开始留宿。"

Shinji looked around and realized how weird it was that he was talking about this out loud to himself and suddenly felt lonely. At least he had had someone to talk to, but now...  
真嗣环顾四周，意识到自己大声谈论这件事有多奇怪，突然感到孤单。至少他曾经有个人可以交谈，但现在...

"It'll work out," he said. Then shook his head and thought, 'I've got to stop talking out loud, its weird."  
"会好起来的，"他说。然后摇了摇头想，'我得停止自言自语，这太奇怪了。"

Walking over to the table he tore off a piece of paper on the notepad that was sitting there and rummaged in his bag to find a pen that would work. Finding one that was suitable he hastily scribbled a quick message about where he was going.  
他走到桌前，从放在那里的便签本上撕下一张纸，然后在包里翻找能用的笔。找到一支合适的笔后，他匆忙地草草写下他要去哪里的信息。

Hey, I see you woke up early, odd. Anyway I'm leaving finally and thought that I should at least tell you about it. I think I told you that I might get moved again by my father, but you might not have been sober at the time. Well, I'm finally leaving now so you don't have to worry about me upsetting your girlfriend when she's over.  
嘿，我看到你早起了，真奇怪。不管怎样，我终于要走了，觉得至少应该告诉你一声。我可能跟你说过我爸可能又要搬家，但当时你可能还没清醒。好吧，我现在真的要走了，这样你就不用担心我会在你女朋友来的时候惹她不高兴了。

Shinji paused here and remembered when he had walked in on the two of them making love. The thought of that still brought stomach acid up his esophagus. Not sure how to finish it now he simply signed his name at the end of it and carried it into his room and placed it on his futon.  
真嗣在这里停顿了一下，回想起他无意中撞见他们做爱的情景。一想到那个，他仍感到胃酸涌上食道。不确定现在该如何结束，他简单地在末尾签上名字，然后拿着纸条走进房间，放在他的被褥上。

Walking back into what was considered the living room, he gave everything one last look before he turned his back on his old home and walked out the door.  
他再次走进被视为客厅的地方，在转身离开旧家之前，他最后环顾了一眼四周，然后走出了门。

---

Shinji walked the quickest way to get to his destination. He had a little under forty-five minutes to get to this cafe where he was supposed to me Misato. Taking many short cuts down alleyways and old gravel roads, he paused for a minute against a street sign catching his breath. His SDAT had repeated itself several times over now and he pulled the earphones out of his ear getting bored with the music.  
真嗣以最快的路线赶往目的地。他还有不到四十五分钟的时间到达那家咖啡馆，他要在那里与美里见面。他穿过许多小巷和老碎石路，抄了近路，在一根路标旁停下来喘口气。他的 SDAT 已经重复播放了好几次，他感到无聊，便把耳机从耳朵里取了出来。

Stuffing it back in his bag he straightened up and swung his bag over his shoulder and continued on to the cafe.  
他把 SDAT 塞回包里，挺直身子，将包甩到肩上，继续向咖啡馆走去。

When Shinji arrived his first impression of it was one of disgust. It was tucked away in a corner of the street and looked as though it was reserved for only the poor. Now though that Shinji looked around he saw that he was in one of the old slums of Tokyo-3. It looked like a shack more than anything. The sign which hung over the front of the cafe was slightly lopsided and the nails that held it to the wood where rusted and obviously strained from the weight on the metal sign. The roof looked as though it had suffered many a battering from past storms and some of the shingles were missing. Shinji figured that it smelled like rot and mold inside and decided to wait outside. Or he felt that he would be mimicking his old roommate and vomiting.  
当真嗣到达时，他对这个地方的第一印象是厌恶。它蜷缩在街道的一角，看起来似乎只留给穷人。然而现在，当真嗣环顾四周，他发现自己身处东京-3 的老旧贫民窟中。它看起来更像是一个棚屋。悬挂在咖啡馆前方的招牌略微倾斜，固定它的钉子锈迹斑斑，显然因金属招牌的重量而承受着压力。屋顶看起来经历过多次暴风雨的摧残，有些瓦片已经缺失。真嗣猜测里面弥漫着腐烂和霉菌的气味，决定在外面等待。或者，他觉得自己可能会模仿旧室友，呕吐起来。

Sitting himself down on the edge of the sidewalk he waited there for Misato to pick him up and take him away to whatever place she came from. Shinji started feeling drowsy again and tried to keep himself awake, but to no avail.  
他坐在人行道边缘，等待美里来接他，带他去她来自的任何地方。真嗣又开始感到困倦，试图保持清醒，但无济于事。

It was sometime later when Shinji awoke to the sound of a car engine. It sounded like it was in agony and if it had voice Shinji knew it would be screaming. Pushing himself up into a sitting position he looked to his left where he thought he heard the sound coming from. Suddenly he saw a blue spec speeding towards him.  
过了一段时间，真嗣被汽车引擎的声音吵醒。那声音听起来像是在痛苦中挣扎，如果引擎能说话，真嗣知道它一定会尖叫。他撑起身子坐起来，朝他认为声音传来的左边看去。突然间，他看到一个蓝色的小点正飞速向他逼近。

'Shit,' he thought. 'That drivers crazy. If I don't move out of the way I'm gonna have my feet flattened into pancake.'  
“该死，”他想，“那司机疯了。如果我不躲开，我的脚就要被压成肉饼了。”

Rolling over so that he was several feet away from the curb he was suddenly glad that he had done so. The car hadn't slowed at all and only stopped when its two wheels on its right side struck the curb and ran up along it. If Shinji hadn't backed away as far as he had, he would have been pulled under the car.  
他翻滚着离开路边几英尺远，突然庆幸自己这么做了。那辆车完全没有减速，直到右侧的两个轮子撞上路边并沿着它行驶才停下来。如果真嗣没有及时后退，他就会被卷到车底下。

Shinji felt something trickling down his arm now and looked down to see that in his haste to get out of the way he had skinned his elbow. 'Wonderful,' he thought. 'Thanks to this crazy driver I'm bleeding now.'  
真嗣感觉到有什么东西顺着他的手臂流下来，低头一看，发现自己因为急于躲避而擦伤了手肘。'真倒霉，'他想，'都怪这个疯狂的司机，我现在流血了。'

Standing up slowly, he brushed the dust off his pants and shirt and now looked at his elbow. His elbow was tinged with gravel and dirt and was starting to sting a little bit. Kneeling down he reached for his bag to take a cloth out when someone grabbed his hand. He turned around slowly to see the driver of the blue car looking at him with a worried look in her eyes.  
他慢慢地站起来，拍掉裤子和衬衫上的灰尘，然后看向自己的手肘。手肘沾满了碎石和泥土，开始有点刺痛。他跪下来伸手去拿包里的布，这时有人抓住了他的手。他缓缓转过身，看到蓝色汽车的司机正用担忧的眼神看着他。

"Your not bleeding are you?"  
“你没流血吧？”

Shinji thought it would have been rude to state the obvious and make her feel ashamed and simply shrugged it off as though it was no big deal.  
真嗣认为直接指出这一点会显得很无礼，让她感到羞愧，于是他只是耸了耸肩，好像没什么大不了的。

"You are bleeding aren't you? Oh God I'm so sorry. I was just so late that I was forced to speed most of the way here, and I didn't see you and wasn't able to stop in time."  
“你流血了，对吧？哦天哪，真对不起。我太迟了，不得不一路加速赶来，没看到你，也没能及时停下来。”

She walked back to her car and opened the glove compartment and pulled out a simple first aid kit. Shinji thought this was going a bit far and opened his mouth to say so but she simply shook her head.  
她走回自己的车，打开手套箱，拿出一个简易急救包。真嗣觉得这有点过头了，正要开口说，但她只是摇了摇头。

"Its my fault that you're injured so let me do this."  
“你受伤是我的错，所以让我来处理吧。”

Shinji simply shrugged again and let her tend to his elbow. Then he felt the stinging grow stronger and had a sudden urge to yell out. He looked down and saw that she was rubbing his elbow with a small cloth that he suspected had alcohol on it. Looking away quickly so she wouldn't see the painful expression on his face. It was an odd feeling that he wasn't able to express. It almost felt like something a mother would do. Though he wasn't sure what a mother was like, since his had died when he had been young. Thoughts of his mother led to his father and he felt boiling hatred surge through him.  
真嗣只是再次耸了耸肩，任由她处理他的手肘。随后，他感到刺痛感愈发强烈，突然有种想要大叫的冲动。他低头一看，发现她正用一块小布擦拭他的手肘，他怀疑那布上沾了酒精。他迅速移开视线，以免她看到他脸上的痛苦表情。这是一种他无法表达的奇怪感觉，几乎像是母亲会做的事情。尽管他不确切知道母亲是什么样的，因为他的母亲在他年幼时就去世了。想到母亲，他不禁想起了父亲，一股沸腾的恨意涌上心头。

This stranger must have seen this and asked if he was all right. Shinji nodded and thought that he should at least thank her for what she was trying to make up for what she had done.  
这位陌生人一定察觉到了这一点，便问他是否还好。真嗣点点头，心想至少应该感谢她，因为她正试图弥补她所造成的伤害。

"Hey...um...thanks for well...helping..."  
"嘿...嗯...谢谢你...帮忙..."

"No problem," she smiled. "Its all my fault anyway so I feel responsible for cleaning it."  
"没事的，" 她微笑着说。"反正都是我的错，所以我有责任清理干净。"

"Thanks," Shinji mumbled again.  
"谢谢，" 真嗣又咕哝了一声。

The female stranger responded by putting a bandage over Shinji's scrape. Shinji now raised his elbow looked at it. It still stung a little, but at least it was clean. He could see that some blood was trying to seep through the bandage and knew he'd have to change it later.  
那位女陌生人用一个创可贴覆盖了真嗣的擦伤。真嗣抬起手肘看了看，虽然还有点刺痛，但至少干净了。他能看到有些血迹试图透过创可贴渗出来，知道稍后得更换它。

Looking over at the female driver he finally got a good look at her face. She seemed to be in her mid to late twenties. She had long purple hair that was tied back in a pony tail and on top of her head she had a pair of sun glasses. 'Way to young to be my mother,' thought Shinji. Then he looked at her chest and was surprised to see a Nerv I.D. badge pinned to her jacket which he now saw had the Nerv emblem of a leaf embedded on the shoulder.  
他转头看向那位女司机，终于看清了她的脸。她看起来二十多岁，有着一头紫色的长发，扎成马尾，头上还戴着一副太阳镜。'年纪太小了，不可能是我妈妈，'真嗣心想。然后他注意到她的胸前别着一个 NERV 的身份证章，现在他才看到她的夹克肩部嵌有 NERV 的叶子标志。

"Look I'm really sorry about what happened just now. I just..."  
“听着，我真的很抱歉刚才发生的事。我只是……”

"Don't worry so much about it. You've more than made up for what just happened." Shinji now gave her a small smile that she returned somewhat forcefully.  
"别太担心了。你已经远远弥补了刚才发生的事。" 真嗣现在给了她一个微笑，她也有些用力地回应了他。

Shinji surprised himself at the bluntness of his next question. "You don't happen to work at Nerv do you?"  
真嗣对自己接下来问题的直率感到惊讶。"你不会正好在 NERV 工作吧？"

The female driver frowned at him. "I didn't know many people knew about the existence of Nerv."  
女司机皱着眉看着他。"我没想到很多人都知道 NERV 的存在。"

"Well, the badge is in full few and you've got the emblem on your jacket. So it was a little bit obvious."  
"嗯，徽章闪闪发亮，你的夹克上也有标志。所以稍微有点明显。"

"How do you know so much? Do you know someone who works there?"  
"你怎么知道这么多？你认识那里工作的人吗？"

"Err yeah. My father does, at least, last time I talked to him he did. Though that was about a year ago."  
"呃，是的。我父亲在那儿工作，至少上次我跟他通话时是这样。虽然那已经是大约一年前的事了。"

"Your father," said the female driver now with a shocked look on her face.  
"你父亲，"女司机此刻脸上露出震惊的表情。

"I think so. Why you don't know him do you?"  
"我想是的。你怎么会不认识他呢？"

"Wait," she paused. "Your last name doesn't happen to be Ikari does it?"  
"等等，"她停顿了一下。"你的姓氏该不会是碇吧？"

"Yeah it does," said Shinji just as surprised.  
“是啊，确实如此，”真嗣同样感到惊讶地说道。

Suddenly the female driver sat down on the curb next to him and laughed out. This shocked Shinji more than anything that had happened so far that day. Her mood immediately changed from concerned to one of complete laxness. She suddenly hit him rather hard on the back, looked at him again, and laughed.  
突然，女司机坐在了他旁边的路边，放声大笑。这让真嗣比那天发生的任何事情都更加震惊。她的情绪立刻从关切转变为完全的放松。她突然重重地拍了一下他的背，再次看着他，又笑了起来。

"So I take it you know my dad?"  
“这么说，你认识我爸爸？”

"Know him. Everyone in Nerv knows who your father is. I work for him. He's the man thats in charge of Nerv. Gendo Ikari is well known for his experiments with-"  
"认识他。NERV 里的每个人都知道你父亲是谁。我为他工作。他是 NERV 的负责人。碇源堂因其与……"

She cut herself off and Shinji looked back at her rather blankly.  
她突然停了下来，真嗣茫然地回头看着她。

"Well," she said. "This makes my job a lot easier. Though I never would have thought that I'd almost run you over. I was a bit worried that you would have gotten tired of waiting for me."  
"好吧，"她说。"这让我的工作轻松多了。虽然我从没想过会差点撞到你。我还担心你会等得不耐烦呢。"

Shinji frowned at her, "You act as though you were planning to meet with...wait," and here Shinji turned to her and his eyes widened slightly. "You don't happen to be Misato Katsuragi."  
真嗣皱着眉头看着她，"你表现得好像是计划去见...等等，"说到这里，真嗣转向她，眼睛微微睁大。"你该不会就是葛城美里吧。"

She simply winked at him and said, "Bingo Shinji."  
她只是向他眨了眨眼，说："答对了，真嗣。"

Shinji was surprised but also felt happy with the change of circumstances. "So I take it that I'll be living with you for a while," he asked.  
真嗣感到惊讶，但也对情况的转变感到高兴。"那么，我是不是要和你一起住一段时间？"他问道。

"That appears to be so."  
"看来确实如此。"

Shinji suddenly felt happier than he could last remember. She didn't seem all that much like an adult now that she knew who he was but he didn't seem to care. He was just happy that he seemed to be able to talk with her easily.  
真嗣突然感到比他最近记忆中的任何时候都要快乐。她现在知道他是谁了，看起来并不那么像一个成年人，但他似乎并不介意。他只是很高兴能和她轻松地交谈。

"Well," she said standing up. "Now that I found you I suggest that we head back to my apartment and get you settled in." She looked at the bag that was sitting next to him. "I take it thats all the stuff you own."  
"好吧，"她站起身来说道，"既然我找到了你，我建议我们回我的公寓，让你安顿下来。"她看了看他旁边的包，"我想这就是你所有的东西了吧。"

Shinji looked down and nodded. It wasn't a whole lot of stuff. Most of it he had had for several years and he needed to get some new clothes. His old ones were starting to get too small.  
真嗣低头看了看，点了点头。东西并不多。大部分他已经用了好几年，需要添置些新衣服了。旧的已经开始显得太小了。

"Well, I think that I'll have to take you shopping sometime so you can get whatever you like. I take it you haven't had many choices to choose what you want."  
“嗯，我想我得找个时间带你去购物，这样你可以买到你喜欢的任何东西。我猜你之前没多少选择自己想要的东西的机会吧。”

Shinji continued to look down and mumbled a barely audible 'no.'  
真嗣继续低着头，用几乎听不见的声音咕哝了一声‘没有’。

Misato looked at him and felt a small smile appear on her face. Tapping him slightly on the shoulder she gestured for him to put his stuff in the back, which he did.  
美里看着他，脸上不由自主地露出了微笑。她轻轻拍了拍他的肩膀，示意他把东西放到后面去，他照做了。

"OK," she said. "Next stop my apartment. And I'll try not to drive too sporadically so you don't feel sick."  
“好，”她说，“下一站是我的公寓。我会尽量平稳驾驶，免得你晕车。”

At this point Shinji was just happy to have found somebody that seemed to care about him.  
此时，真嗣只是庆幸自己找到了一个似乎关心他的人。

---

Whatever Misato Katsuragi was, she was not clean. Navigating through the mess that was her apartment was almost impossible. Shinji took a small room adjacent to another room that was currently empty. He had thought about asking why he wasn't using that one, but decided it was best not to be rude. She was giving him a place to sleep after all.  
无论米萨托·卡苏拉基是什么样的人，她绝不是个整洁的人。穿越她那乱糟糟的公寓几乎是不可能的任务。真嗣住进了一个紧邻另一间空房间的小房间。他本想问为什么不让他住那间，但觉得还是不要失礼为好。毕竟，她给了他一个睡觉的地方。

One thing that he hadn't been expecting about her was the fact that she drank a lot of beer. Upon opening the fridge to get something to drink, he saw more six packs of beer than what had been at his old roommates place. Shinji wasn't sure whether to laugh, or feel annoyed and simply closed it and got water out of the tap.  
有一件事他没料到，那就是她喝很多啤酒。打开冰箱想找点喝的，他发现啤酒六包装的数量比他以前的室友那儿还多。真嗣不确定是该笑，还是感到恼火，最后他只是关上冰箱，从水龙头接了水喝。

Misato had to go back to work almost immediately when they had gotten back and said that she wouldn't be back until later in the afternoon. She said that she would tell his father that she had picked him up, and that now he was now living in her apartment. Shinji was guessing that his father didn't care. As long as he wasn't bothering him at all.  
米萨托几乎一回来就得立刻回去工作，她说下午晚些时候才能回来。她告诉他，她会通知他父亲已经把他接来了，现在他住在她的公寓里。真嗣猜想他父亲并不在乎。只要他不打扰他就行。

Shinji had gotten tired of the bottles of beer and bags of junk food littering the floor and decided to do clean the apartment. From what he saw, she mainly ate take out or instant meals.  
真嗣对满地的啤酒瓶和垃圾食品袋感到厌倦，决定打扫一下公寓。从他看到的来看，她主要吃外卖或速食。

'Well, good thing I taught myself how to cook these past years,' thought Shinji.  
'还好这几年我自学了烹饪，'真嗣心想。

Finished with the cleaning, he proceeded to take a shower but opened the wrong door and found himself face to face with a penguin. Shinji let out a loud yell that could be heard several floors down as he backed up to the fridge reaching for a blunt object. The penguin simply looked back at him blinking at him sleepily. Yawning widely the penguin grasped a hold of the sliding door and closed it once again, but not before giving a loud squawk in Shinji's direction  
打扫完毕后，他去洗澡，却误开了另一扇门，迎面撞见一只企鹅。真嗣惊声尖叫，声音响彻几层楼，他后退到冰箱旁，伸手去拿钝器。企鹅只是睡眼惺忪地眨眼看着他。打了个大大的哈欠，企鹅抓住推拉门再次关上，临走前还朝真嗣的方向发出一声响亮的鸣叫。

Shinji's heart was beating faster than he could last remember. 'What the hell is that woman thinking. Keeping a penguin in an environment like this.' Now though he wondered if the penguin had some bit of intelligence in it and decided to ask her later.  
真嗣的心跳比他记忆中任何时候都要快。'那个女人到底在想什么。在这种环境下养企鹅。' 不过现在他好奇那只企鹅是否有些许智慧，决定稍后再问她。

Sighing slightly he walked to the correct bathroom this time, stripped quickly, and was pleased to feel the hot water hitting his skin. For no apparent reason, his thoughts strayed to last night when he had seen that girl down by the shore against the setting sun. If he knew that things would have happened like this and he would be staying in Tokyo-3, then he would have asked her name at least. Though now it seemed that he wouldn't see her again. "Wonder what she's like..." He wondered out loud.  
他轻叹一声，这次走向了正确的浴室，迅速脱掉衣服，感受着热水洒在皮肤上的舒适。不知为何，他的思绪飘到了昨晚，他在海边看到那个女孩，夕阳映衬着她的身影。如果他早知道事情会变成这样，他会留在第三新东京市，至少会问她的名字。但现在看来，他可能再也见不到她了。“不知道她是什么样的人...”他自言自语道。

Suddenly he hit his head against the wall of the shower. Certain thoughts had just crossed his mind and he didn't quite appreciate them. He didn't even know who she was. Hadn't even seen her face for that matter. 'Stop thinking like that you idiot. The chances of seeing her again are almost nil.'  
突然间，他的头撞到了淋浴间的墙上。某些念头刚刚闪过他的脑海，他并不喜欢这些想法。他甚至不知道她是谁，连她的脸都没看清。'别再这么想了，你这个傻瓜。再见到她的可能性几乎为零。'

Turning off the hot water before anything else crossed his mind, he wrapped a towel around his waist and walked to his bedroom to change.  
他首先关掉了热水，然后围上一条毛巾，走向卧室换衣服。

Misato didn't come home until late at night. Shinji had fallen asleep in his new room with his SDAT waiting for her to come home. He awoke when he heard her stumbling around the kitchen and slid his door open a little to see her looking in the fridge for something.  
美里直到深夜才回家。真嗣在他的新房间里睡着了，SDAT 播放器还在等着她回来。听到她在厨房里跌跌撞撞的声音，他醒了过来，轻轻拉开房门，看到她在冰箱里找东西。

"Misato-san, you're home later than you said you would be."  
“美里小姐，你回来得比说的要晚呢。”

"Oh sorry Shinji. I had some things I had to take care of. Thanks for cleaning up around her. I've been meaning to, but I just don't have enough time."  
“哦，抱歉，真嗣。我有些事情需要处理。谢谢你帮她打扫。我一直想做，但就是没时间。”

Shinji highly doubted that she would have cleaned, even if she had a week of nothing to do, but he didn't care. It kept him occupied at least when he had nothing to do.  
真嗣高度怀疑即使她有一周的空闲时间，她也不会打扫，但他并不在意。至少在他无所事事时，这让他有事可做。

Sitting down in a chair next to her, he frowned when he saw that she had a can of beer in her hand. Even though Shinji was only fifteen he knew that drinking before bed wasn't the smartest thing to do, and opened his mouth to say something when she cut across him.  
他坐在她旁边的椅子上，看到她手里拿着一罐啤酒时皱起了眉头。尽管真嗣只有十五岁，但他知道睡前喝酒不是明智之举，正要开口说些什么时，她打断了他。

"I talked to your father and he wanted me to tell you something."  
"我和你父亲谈过了，他有些话让我转告你。"

Shinji wasn't it the mood to listen to anything that his father felt worthwhile but simply nodded.  
真嗣此刻并无心情听父亲认为有价值的事，只是简单地点了点头。

"He wants you to continue going to the school your currently attending."  
"他希望你继续在目前就读的学校学习。"

Shinji was surprised at this. "Does he want to keep me here for a while or something?"  
真嗣对此感到惊讶。“他是想让我在这里待一段时间吗？”

"Can't say," said Misato taking a huge gulp of beer.  
“不好说，”美里说着，猛灌了一大口啤酒。

"I met that penguin of yours but the way," said Shinji.  
“我顺便见到了你的那只企鹅，”真嗣说道。

Misato raised an eyebrow at him and put her beer down. "Forgot that I hadn't shown Pen-Pen to you yet. He didn't attack you or anything did he?"  
美里对他挑了挑眉，放下手中的啤酒。“忘了我还没带你见过 Pen-Pen 呢。他没攻击你吧？”

"No. Seemed like I woke him up though, but he just went back to sleep."  
“没有。不过我好像把他吵醒了，但他只是又睡回去了。”

"Just like him." She finished her beer and belched rather unladylike. She was a lot different than what he had expected.  
“他就这样。”她喝完啤酒，打了个相当不淑女的嗝。她和他的预期大相径庭。

"I'm going to bed now. I expect you to go to school like a good boy tomorrow. Make sure you do go, or you'll have to answer to me."  
"我现在要去睡觉了。我希望你明天能像个乖孩子一样去上学。一定要去，否则你得向我解释。"

Shinji chuckled, "You sound like a mother."  
真嗣轻笑道：“你听起来像个妈妈。”

"I'm now your guardian so its only natural that I look after you."  
"我现在是你的监护人，所以照顾你是理所当然的。"

Shinji blinked and felt tears forming in his eyes and hastily wiped them away with the back of his hand.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，感觉泪水在眼眶中形成，急忙用手背擦去。

"Well, I'll see you tomorrow Shinji, good night."  
“那么，明天见，真嗣，晚安。”

"Yeah, good night Misato."  
“嗯，晚安，美里。”

---

When Shinji arrived at school the next day whispers followed him wherever he went. Apparently most of the kids had thought he had finally dropped out. They were therefore surprised to see him there the next day. True to his word Shinji, didn't even bring his SDAT so that it wouldn't distract him. Now that he had a place that he could happily call home he felt like putting more of an effort into his school work, even if the other kids didn't believe him.  
第二天，当真嗣踏入学校时，耳边传来的窃窃私语如影随形。显然，大多数孩子都以为他终于退学了。因此，看到他第二天出现在学校，他们都感到惊讶。正如他承诺的那样，真嗣甚至没有带上他的 SDAT，以免分心。现在他有了一个可以称之为家的温馨之地，他觉得自己应该更加努力学习，即使其他孩子不相信他。

His teacher still didn't think that he was trying seriously though, and ignored him for most of the day. The morning passed without much of a difference in what Shinji was normally used to, and he was just thinking of going home when there teacher addressed them.  
尽管如此，他的老师仍然认为他没有认真对待学习，大部分时间都忽视了他。上午的时光与真嗣平常所经历的并无太大差别，正当他想着回家时，老师向他们讲话了。

"We have a new student that will be joining us today. She is an exchange student from Germany and she can speak Japanese fluently. She has also graduated from a German university at the age of fourteen and is extremely brilliant."  
“我们今天有一位新同学加入。她是从德国来的交换生，日语说得非常流利。她在十四岁时就从德国的一所大学毕业，极其聪明。”

He looked up from the piece of paper that he was reading from and looking towards the door. "Is that it then?" he asked with a slight annoyed tone in his voice?  
他从正在阅读的纸张上抬起头，望向门口。“就这样了吗？”他带着一丝不悦的语气问道？

"Yeah, thats enough," said an energetic voice from the other side of the door leading out into the hallway.  
“是的，够了，”门外走廊传来一个充满活力的声音。

Shinji was starring out the window and was only picking up about half of this. 'Just another annoying girl like the rest of them,' he thought.  
真嗣正望着窗外，只听进了一半的内容。'不过是又一个像其他女孩一样烦人的家伙，'他心想。

Again there teacher starting talking but the girl had cut across him now. "I can introduce myself," she said.  
老师再次开始讲话，但女孩此刻打断了他。“我可以自我介绍，”她说。

Even though Shinji wasn't paying attention to what was going on he could tell that a change in the room had happened. All the guys around him had started whispering all at once and Shinji could only assume that it had something to do with the new girl.  
尽管真嗣没有注意周围发生的事情，但他能感觉到房间里发生了变化。他周围的男生们突然同时开始窃窃私语，真嗣只能猜测这与新来的女孩有关。

The girl had started talking again either oblivious to the muttering of the guys or simply enjoying it.  
女孩又开始说话了，无论是对男生们的低语浑然不觉，还是单纯地享受着这种氛围。

Shinji heard the light tapping of chalk against the board and now heard her start talking again though this time he was paying attention enough to at least get her name.  
真嗣听到粉笔轻敲黑板的声音，现在又听到她开始讲话了，这次他至少注意到了她的名字。

"My name is Asuka Langely Soryu. Pleasure to meet all of you."  
“我叫惣流·明日香·兰格雷。很高兴见到大家。”

All at once their was a massive babbling from all the guys except Shinji who was once again ignoring the whole thing. Asuka had questions launched at her from all over the place and she couldn't help but smirk as all the guys fawned over her.  
一瞬间，除了真嗣外，所有男生都开始七嘴八舌起来。明日香被四面八方的问题轰炸，忍不住对那些围着她献殷勤的男生们露出得意的笑容。

It took sometime for there teacher to get everyone quieted down. When he had yelled at several guys who had tried to get her phone number and threatened several others to send them to the principles office, he told Asuka to take the empty seat in front of Shinji.  
花了些时间，老师才让所有人安静下来。他对着几个试图要她电话号码的男生大吼，又威胁要把其他几个人送到校长办公室，然后让 Asuka 坐在 Shinji 前面的空位上。

Shinji only caught this last part and sighed slightly. From the sound of this girl, she thought that she was superior to everyone else. He would have preferred to just continue looking out the window, but saw that somebody was standing over him.  
Shinji 只听到了最后这部分，微微叹了口气。从这女孩的语气来看，她自认为高人一等。他本想继续望着窗外，却注意到有人站在他面前。

Looking away from the window he came face to face with Asuka, who was starring back at him. The entire classroom had gone quiet and Shinji felt his heart stop as soon as he looked into her face.  
他转过视线，不再看向窗外，迎面遇上了 Asuka 的目光，她正盯着他。整个教室都安静了下来，Shinji 一看到她的脸，心跳仿佛都停止了。

'No way,' he thought. 'She can't be, but...no its gotta be her.'  
“不可能，”他心想，“她不可能是，但……不，肯定是她。”

He was looking up into the face of the girl he had seen on the beach. Her hair was the correct color and Shinji confirmed that it was her when he saw the hair clips that she had in her hair. His eyes strayed to her face and saw that she had blue eyes which seemed to be rather stern. He couldn't believe that he was looking into the face of her, and that he also knew her name now. What's more she was looking at him rather intently and curiously. 'This is awkward,' thought Shinji as beads of sweat formed on his forehead.  
他抬头看着那个在海滩上见过的女孩的脸。她的发色完全吻合，当看到她头发上的发夹时，真嗣确认了就是她。他的目光移到她的脸上，发现她有着相当严肃的蓝色眼睛。他不敢相信自己正凝视着她的脸，而且现在还知道了她的名字。更甚的是，她正相当专注且好奇地看着他。“这真尴尬，”真嗣想着，额头上冒出了汗珠。

Suddenly she put her hand out and flicked her forefinger against his forehead making him flinch slightly. Shinji wasn't sure what to make of this behavior. Was she teasing him, or what?  
突然，她伸出手，用食指弹了一下他的额头，让他微微一缩。真嗣不确定她这是什么意思。是在逗他吗，还是别的什么？

Suddenly their teacher cleared his throat slightly and Asuka turned around to frown at him. Shinji's eyes strayed over her again taking her in. Shinji felt that if he continued to stare at her, he would start having strange thoughts again, and quickly turned his gaze back to the window. Asuka saw this and now there was a very annoyed look on her face. She turned her back on him and sat down in front of him.  
突然，他们的老师轻轻清了清喉咙，明日香转过身来皱眉看着他。真嗣的目光再次掠过她，细细打量。真嗣觉得如果继续盯着她看，他又会开始产生奇怪的想法，于是迅速将视线转回窗外。明日香看到这一幕，脸上露出了非常不悦的表情。她转过身背对着他，坐在他前面。

Shinji could hear the muttering of the fellow males in his classroom all discussing what had just happened between the two. "Why does he get to sit behind her?"  
真嗣能听到教室里其他男生在窃窃私语，讨论着刚才两人之间发生的事情。"为什么他能坐在她后面？"

"And why did she flick his forehead? Do they know each other from somewhere?"  
“还有，她为什么弹他的额头？他们是不是在哪儿认识？”

Shinji was getting annoyed at this, and saw that in front of him Asuka was steadily turning red.  
这让真嗣感到恼火，他看到前方的明日香正逐渐涨红了脸。

However the teacher started to call out roll and brought the class back order.  
然而，老师开始点名，将课堂秩序恢复了。

Asuka meanwhile was thinking about what had just happened. When she had walked into the class every single guy was drooling over her, though that one behind her hadn't even flinched when she walked in. Either he was gay, retarded, or had no emotions of which she thought the last one was mostly true. She had attempted to get a reaction out of him by flirting with him a little, just to tease him, but he didn't even respond. 'How pathetic,' she thought. She couldn't stand weak guys.  
与此同时，明日香正在思考刚刚发生的事情。当她走进教室时，每个男生都对她垂涎三尺，唯独她身后的那个家伙在她进来时连眼皮都没动一下。要么他是同性恋，要么是智力障碍，要么就是毫无情感，她认为最后一种可能性最大。她试图通过稍微调情来激起他的反应，只是为了逗逗他，但他甚至没有任何回应。'真是可悲，'她想。她无法忍受软弱的男人。

Meanwhile the teacher had continued to call out names and Asuka answered when she heard hers called. When the teacher asked if Ayanami Rei was still absent Asuka smirked, 'So the precious First Child goes to this school as well. What a fun experience that will be, trying to have a conversation with the doll. She's even more lifeless than the guy behind me.'  
与此同时，老师继续点名，听到自己的名字时，明日香应了一声。当老师询问绫波零是否仍缺席时，明日香轻蔑一笑，'原来那个珍贵的第一适格者也在这所学校啊。跟那个娃娃交流一定很有趣，她比坐在我后面的家伙还要死气沉沉。'

The teacher went through the list of names and Shinji was starting to wonder if his name was even still on their when the teacher called out his name rather reluctantly.  
老师逐一念出名单上的名字，真嗣开始怀疑自己的名字是否还在上面，这时老师颇为勉强地叫出了他的名字。

"And Shinji Ikari. You're still here aren't you?" It was as if the teacher wished he wasn't.  
“还有碇真嗣，你还在这里吧？”仿佛老师希望他不在似的。

"Yeah," replied Shinji. 'Though I sure as hell don't want to be,' he thought.  
“嗯，”真嗣回答道。'虽然我绝对不想这样，'他心想。

Asuka however had spun around in her chair when she heard Shinji's last name, and frowned at him.  
然而，听到真嗣的姓氏后，明日香在椅子上转过身来，皱着眉头看向他。

Shinji noticed this but continued to stare out the window. 'God what is wrong with her? As far as I know she has no reason to hate me at all. Or is she just normally annoyed at everyone?'  
真嗣注意到了这一点，但继续凝视着窗外。'上帝啊，她怎么了？据我所知，她没有任何理由恨我。还是她对每个人都这样烦躁？'

Asuka had heard that Shinji's last name was Ikari but was still surprised to hear it. 'So your the son of Gendo Ikari who's in charge of Nerv, huh. I guess going to this school wasn't a complete waste of my time.'  
明日香曾听说真嗣的姓氏是碇，但亲耳听到还是感到惊讶。'原来你是那个负责 NERV 的碇源堂的儿子啊。看来来这所学校也不完全是浪费我的时间。'

Turning around, Asuka faced the front of the room, ignoring Shinji for the rest of the class period.  
明日香转过身，面向教室前方，整个课间再也没有理会真嗣。

Shinji however couldn't help but have his eyes stray towards her occasionally. She was really quite beautiful, even if her attitude was a little rough. Shinji was really starting to wish that he had just asked her name yesterday. If he had, maybe things wouldn't have gotten off to such a rough start.  
然而，真嗣忍不住时不时将目光投向她。她真的很美，尽管态度有些粗鲁。真嗣开始后悔昨天没有问她的名字。如果当时问了，也许事情就不会一开始就那么糟糕。

---

After school Shinji slowly walked back towards Misato's apartment. He figured that she would be wanting to hear about what he did in school today. 'She can be a bit annoying at times,' he thought. But then she was the best roommate that he had, so he wasn't complaining.  
放学后，真嗣缓缓走向美里小姐的公寓。他猜想她会想听听他今天在学校做了些什么。'她有时确实有点烦人，'他想。但她是他最好的室友，所以他并不抱怨。

As Shinji walked he couldn't help but notice that Asuka was walking on the sidewalk opposite of where he was. It seemed that the two of them where heading in the same direction and Shinji felt slightly nervous, remembering that their paths would cross at the next intersection.  
真嗣走着走着，忍不住注意到明日香在他对面的便道上走着。看起来他们俩正朝着同一个方向前进，真嗣感到有些紧张，记得他们的路线会在下一个路口交汇。

As she crossed the sidewalk to get on his side, he hurriedly sped up so that he could be in front of her. He was nervous now about talking to her, considering she seemed to dislike him. Shinji really didn't want to talk with her right now, and constantly looked over his shoulder to check that she was still a good distance away. Call him a coward if you will, but the last thing he wanted was to get on this girls bad side. Surprisingly though, he heard her calling out to him.  
当她穿过便道来到他这边时，他急忙加快脚步，以便能走在她前面。他现在对和她说话感到紧张，考虑到她似乎不喜欢他。真嗣真的不想现在和她说话，并不时回头确认她还在一段距离之外。如果你愿意，可以称他为懦夫，但他最不想的就是惹恼这个女孩。然而，出乎意料的是，他听到她在叫他。

"Oi, you, from this morning. Slow down a minute, I want to talk to you."  
“喂，你，今早的那个。慢点儿，我有话跟你说。”

Shinji did his best to ignore her, and kept walking forward, but his pace quickened slightly. He heard hurried footsteps behind him however, and soon, Asuka was matching her pace with his, several feet behind him. Ignoring her he continued to walk at a steady pace.  
真嗣尽力忽视她，继续向前走，但脚步稍稍加快了些。然而，他听到身后急促的脚步声，不久，明日香便与他保持了几步之遥，步伐一致。他继续稳稳地走着，对她视而不见。

'My god,' she thought in German. 'What does it take to get a reaction from this idiot?'  
“我的天，”她用德语想，“要怎样才能让这个白痴有点反应？”

She continued walking directly behind him, but changed pace again, so that she was walking at the same pace next to him. Shinji couldn't help it, and glanced over at her. Asuka was looking over at him. Her lips were smiling, but there was something malicious in her eyes that Shinji didn't care for.  
她继续直接跟在他身后走着，但又改变了步伐，以便与他并肩而行。真嗣忍不住瞥了她一眼。明日香正看着他。她的嘴角带着笑意，但眼中却闪烁着真嗣不喜欢的恶意。

'Does she expect me to say something? Or should I be acting like all the other guys in my classroom did?'  
'她是不是期待我说些什么？还是我应该像班上其他男生那样表现？'

Asuka didn't try say anything to him though, and after walking alongside him for a while in silence, Shinji heard her mumble something inaudible under her breath, and then she sped up past him, throwing him a rather vicious glance as she did.  
然而，明日香并没有试图对他说什么，在沉默中与他并肩走了一会儿后，真嗣听到她低声咕哝了一句听不清的话，然后她加快脚步超过了他，经过时还狠狠地瞪了他一眼。

Shinji slowed down, and then stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, looking up at the sky. 'Wonderful,' he thought. 'I get a cool roommate who acts like my guardian, but now I've met the strangest girl ever. Great way to start my new life out.'  
真嗣放慢了脚步，然后在人行道中央停了下来，抬头望向天空。'真是奇妙，'他心想，'我有了一个酷似监护人的室友，但现在又遇到了有史以来最奇怪的女孩。开启新生活的绝佳方式啊。'

Sighing slightly, he returned his eyes to the sidewalk, and continued walking. He was rather eager to get back to Misato's apartment, his new home, but he wished that Asuka would just go back to Germany.  
他轻轻叹了口气，将目光转回人行道上，继续前行。他相当渴望回到美里小姐的公寓，他的新家，但他希望明日香能直接回德国去。

---

"Misato I'm back," Shinji called as he took off his shoes and stepped into the apartment.  
“美里小姐，我回来了，”真嗣一边喊着，一边脱下鞋子走进了公寓。

"Ah good I was just getting worried. You took longer than I expected."  
"啊，太好了，我正担心呢。你比我想象中花的时间要长。"

"Well, some things happened," said Shinji as he walked into the kitchen and stopped dead when he saw that Misato was drinking tea with someone.  
"嗯，发生了一些事情，" 真嗣说着走进厨房，却在看到美里正和某人喝茶时愣住了。

Asuka was sitting at the kitchen table with Misato holding a tea cup in her hand which immediately fell to the floor, shattering, sending tea in all directions.  
明日香坐在厨房的桌子旁，手里拿着茶杯，茶杯立刻掉到地上，碎裂开来，茶水四溅。

Shinji blinked blankly back and suddenly realized what she was wearing. She was dressed in a loose tang-top which fell loosely around her chest revealing a little more then Shinji cared to comment on. She had apparently abandoned the need to even bother with pants and was in nothing more than her underwear, which were also white. What's more she had removed the hair clips and now her hair was meshed together in one long wave.  
真嗣茫然地眨了眨眼，随即突然意识到她穿的是什么。她身着一件宽松的唐装上衣，松松垮垮地垂在胸前，露出了比真嗣愿意评论的还要多的部分。她显然已经放弃了穿裤子的念头，只穿着内衣，同样也是白色的。更甚的是，她摘掉了发夹，现在她的头发如同一道长长的波浪般披散着。

Asuka stared blankly back at him for several seconds before shouting, "WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?"  
明日香茫然地盯着他看了几秒钟，然后大喊道：“这他妈是什么鬼？”

She ran at him and grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him ferociously. Thankfully Misato stepped in between them before she was able to cause him any more bodily harm.  
她向他冲去，抓住他的肩膀猛烈摇晃。幸好美里及时介入，阻止了她进一步对他造成身体伤害。

"Asuka calm down," said Misato as she dragged her away from Shinji.  
“Asuka，冷静点，”Misato 边说边把她从 Shinji 身边拉开。

"Why is he here!?" “他为什么在这里！？”

Misato simply laughed. "I see that the two of you know each other from somewhere."  
Misato 只是笑了笑。“看来你们俩之前在哪儿见过面。”

Shinji now spoke up and said, "Unfortunately yes."  
真嗣这时开口说道：“不幸的是，确实如此。”

"What was?" yelled Asuka.  
“什么确实如此？”明日香大声问道。

"Now come on you two," said Misato. "You guys are both going to be living here, so I expect you to be able to get along."  
“好啦，你们两个，”美里说，“你们俩以后都要住在这里，所以我希望你们能和睦相处。”

They both stared blankly back at her.  
他们俩都茫然地回望着她。

"Come again?" asked Asuka. "I don't think I heard you correctly?"  
"再说一遍？" 明日香问道，"我觉得我没听清楚？"

"You. Two. Will. Be. Living. Together. Here," repeated Misato.  
"你们两个。将要。一起。住在这里，" 美里重复道。

Asuka looked blankly back at her and then turned around and walked out of the kitchen.  
明日香茫然地回头看了她一眼，然后转身走出了厨房。

"Asuka where are you going?" asked Misato as Asuka gathered up her things.  
“明日香，你要去哪儿？”美里问道，而明日香正在收拾自己的东西。

"I'm leaving. No way in hell can I live in the same apartment with this moron."  
“我要走了。我绝不可能和这个白痴住在同一个公寓里。”

With that she slammed the door and left the apartment.  
说完，她砰地一声关上门，离开了公寓。

Shinji was left standing alone in the kitchen as the whole thing hit him. 'Oh God. Me and Asuka living together? I wouldn't survive a day.' However when Misato came back in, she told him that Asuka had left without any intention of coming back.  
真嗣独自站在厨房里，这一切突然击中了他。'哦，天哪。我和明日香住在一起？我一天都撑不过去。'然而，当美里回来时，她告诉他明日香已经离开，没有回来的打算。

"What the hell happened between the two of you?" asked Misato.  
“你们俩之间到底发生了什么？”美里问道。

"...I'm not even sure," was all Shinji said, before he launched into the school day and what happened afterwards.  
“……我也不确定，”真嗣只说了这么一句，便开始讲述起学校里发生的事以及之后的经过。

---

By the time he had finished several hours had gone by and she could hear the steady plop plop as it started to rain outside.  
当他讲完时，几个小时已经过去了，她能听到外面开始下雨，传来一阵阵稳定的滴答声。

Misato looked out the window. She was starting to get worried about Asuka. She had left in nothing but that tang-top and underwear and was worried that she would be getting cold by now.  
美里望向窗外。她开始担心明日香了。明日香只穿着那件吊带衫和内衣就出去了，她担心她现在可能已经感到冷了。

Walking into the living room she saw that Shinji was contently sitting on the couch listening to his SDAT and reading a book. 'Does he really not care about here? Its not like she's the most unattractive girl out there.' Then she suddenly winced at the prospect of someone taking advantage of her with it raining like this.  
走进客厅，她看到真嗣正惬意地坐在沙发上，听着他的 SDAT，读着一本书。'他真的不在乎这里吗？她又不像是最不吸引人的女孩。'随后她突然因想到在这样的雨天有人可能会利用她而皱起了眉头。

"Shinji get up," she said pushing against his arm rather forcibly.  
“真嗣，起来，”她相当用力地推了推他的手臂说道。

"Huh...Oh Misato, what do you want?"  
“嗯...哦，美里，你想要什么？”

"What I want is for you to go out and find Asuka."  
"我想要的是你去找到明日香。"

Shinji frowned, "Why? You heard her, she doesn't want to be in the same room with me."  
真嗣皱眉，"为什么？你听到了，她不想和我待在同一个房间里。"

"So are you saying you aren't worried about her at all?"  
"那么你是说你一点都不担心她吗？"

"I..." he hesitated. "She can taking of herself," he said finally.  
"我..." 他犹豫了一下。"她能照顾好自己，" 他最终说道。

"Look its raining out and she's left in clothes that aren't even suitable for the summer."  
"看，外面在下雨，她却穿着连夏天都不合适的衣服。"

"Thats her problem not mine."  
"那是她的问题，不是我的。"

This earned him a slap. Putting his hand up to his face, he felt the spot that stung slightly from where Misato's hand had struck him. Looking up, he saw that she was glaring at him with something close to hatred.  
这让他挨了一巴掌。他抬起手摸向脸颊，感觉到被美里手掌击中的地方微微刺痛。抬头一看，只见她正用近乎憎恨的目光瞪着他。

"Are you that insensitive, Shinji? Do you seriously not care what could happen to her? She's out there in the freezing rain, possibly being picked up by some guy in a truck with who knows what happening to her. And you say that it's her problem not yours. She's right you don't have emotions. You're a coward."  
“你就这么迟钝吗，真嗣？你真的不在乎她可能遭遇什么吗？她在外面冰冷的雨中，可能被某个开着卡车的家伙带走，谁知道会发生什么。而你却说那是她的问题，不是你的。她说的没错，你没有感情。你是个懦夫。”

He looked back at her and suddenly felt ashamed of himself for thinking like that. She was right he was emotionless and a coward.  
他回望向她，突然为自己那样想感到羞愧。她说得对，他是个没有感情的懦夫。

Sitting bolt upright now he flung himself off the couch and ran to his room tossing on a pair of jeans a long sleeve shirt and a jacket. He was about to leave the room when he decided that he better bring a spare for Asuka.  
他猛地坐直身子，从沙发上跳下来，冲进自己的房间，迅速套上一条牛仔裤、一件长袖衬衫和一件夹克。正要离开房间时，他决定最好给明日香带件备用的。

He ran out of his room and found himself face to face with Misato.  
他跑出房间，迎面撞上了美里。

"I...I-I'm sorry for being such an insensitive jerk. I'll be sure to find her and bring her back."  
“我……我……我很抱歉，我真是个不体贴的混蛋。我一定会找到她，把她带回来。”

With that he ran out the door into the downpour.  
说完，他便冲出门外，投身于倾盆大雨之中。

Misato smiled slightly at him now, "Hmph he just doesn't want to let on to his emotions."  
美里此刻对他微微一笑，"哼，他就是不想表露自己的情感。"

---

Shinji ran through Tokyo-3, thinking of all the possibilities where Asuka could have gone. It had been at least three hours since she left and forty-five minutes since this downpour had started. 'She must have found shelter somewhere,' he thought and decided to check around some of the slums that littered Tokyo-3. Though he hoped that she had stayed out of those. Even though he had only known her for a short while, and he couldn't say he liked her, he was feeling worried for her sake.  
真嗣在第三新东京市中奔跑，脑海里不断闪现着明日香可能去的地方。她离开至少已有三个小时，而这场大雨也已持续了四十五分钟。'她一定在某处找到了避雨的地方，'他想，并决定去检查一下遍布第三新东京市的贫民窟。尽管他希望她没有涉足那些地方。虽然他认识她不久，也谈不上喜欢她，但他还是为她感到担忧。

Soon Shinji found himself going door to door to peoples houses asking if they had seen a girl around age fifteen or sixteen with long red hair and blue eyes. He didn't feel like mentioning what she was wearing. None of them where able to provide any answer and Shinji eventually decided that she wasn't in this part of Tokyo-3.  
不久，真嗣发现自己挨家挨户地敲门，询问是否有人见过一个大约十五六岁、长着红色长发和蓝色眼睛的女孩。他觉得没必要提及她的穿着。没有人能提供任何线索，真嗣最终断定她不在这片东京-3 的区域。

His mind was starting to scream out at him for letting things escalate to this point. 'AH IF ONLY I HAD JUST ASKED HER NAME YESTERDAY THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED.' Suddenly he remembered the beach yesterday.  
他的内心开始尖叫，责怪自己让事情发展到这个地步。'啊，如果昨天我直接问她的名字，也许就不会发生这种事了。'突然，他想起了昨天的海滩。

'Yes,' he told himself. 'Thats got to be where she is.'  
'没错，'他对自己说，'她一定在那里。'

Running faster than he could remember, with the spare jacket flopping along his shoulders, he managed to get to the beach within the span of minutes. Looking down he couldn't see much, owing to the fact that a mist had settled on the beach. He quickly ran down the steps leading to the beach, and started calling out her name frantically.  
他跑得比记忆中任何时候都快，备用夹克在肩上拍打着，几分钟内就赶到了海滩。低头一看，由于雾气笼罩，几乎看不清什么。他迅速跑下通往海滩的台阶，开始疯狂地呼喊她的名字。

'Damn it, she better be here,' he thought.  
“该死，她最好在这里，”他心想。

This mist was so hard to see, that several times had tripped over wooden logs that had been washed up onto the beach. Suddenly, he tripped over something that was rather large and heavy. Falling to the ground he reached over and felt that it was a bag of some sort. 'Asuka's bag?'  
这雾气如此浓重，以至于好几次他都被冲上沙滩的木头绊倒。突然，他被一个又大又重的东西绊倒了。摔倒在地，他伸手一摸，发现那是一个包。“明日香的包？”

Suddenly he yelled out, "Asuka where are you!?"  
突然，他大喊道：“明日香，你在哪儿！？”

At first, all he could hear was his own voice returning to him on the wind, but then he thought he heard a reply from somewhere off to his right. Scooping up her bag, he ran in the direction of the voice only to trip over something much more squishy and heard a small yelp of surprise. He realized that he had fallen on top of her but didn't care about the position when he heard her voice.  
起初，他只能听到自己的声音随风回荡，但随后他似乎听到右边某个地方传来了回应。他抓起她的包，朝着声音的方向跑去，却不料绊倒在一个软绵绵的东西上，听到了一声小小的惊呼。他意识到自己压在了她身上，但听到她的声音时，他并不在乎这个姿势。

"Idiot, what are you doing out here in the freezing cold."  
“笨蛋，这么冷的天你在外面干什么。”

The mist cleared and he saw that he was a few inches away from her face.  
雾气散去，他发现自己离她的脸只有几英寸远。

"...Asuka," he said weakly.  
"...明日香," 他虚弱地说道。

She frowned up at him, and sighed. "How long do you plan on lying on top of me."  
她皱着眉头看向他，叹了口气。"你打算在我身上躺多久？"

"Ah, no...this is," muttered Shinji.  
“啊，不……这是，”真嗣喃喃道。

He pushed himself off of her, and saw that she had gotten up also. His face opened up into his first blush as he saw that the rain had made her tang-top see through. It clung to her body like a fly clung to fly paper and Shinji had to tear his gaze away from her.  
他推开她，发现她也站了起来。看到雨水让她的短上衣变得透明，紧贴在身上如同苍蝇粘在苍蝇纸上，真嗣的脸颊泛起了第一抹红晕，不得不移开视线。

"So what do you want?" she asked with a scowl.  
“那你想要什么？”她皱着眉问道。

Shinji looked back at her rather surprised. "Why do you think I'm out here in the freezing rain? It certainly isn't to go for a jog."  
真嗣回头看着她，显得有些惊讶。“你觉得我为什么会在这种冰冷的雨中？当然不是为了去跑步。”

"Real witty," she smirked.  
“真机智，”她微微一笑。

"I was worried about you."  
“我担心你。”

Asuka had to let that flow through her mind before it registered.  
明日香不得不让这些思绪在脑海中流淌，然后才逐渐理解。

"You where worried about me?" she whispered.  
“你担心我？”她低声问道。

"Of course. You just left without a word. Then this storm started up, and you...well weren't wearing much so...and also I well...I mean...your not the most err unattractive girl so...I was a bit well...worried about your well being. What with how you looked and...some guys might have wanted to take advantage of that."  
“当然。你一声不吭就走了。然后这场风暴开始了，而你……嗯，穿得不多，所以……而且我也……我的意思是……你不是那种……呃，不吸引人的女孩，所以……我有点……担心你的安危。考虑到你的样子和……有些家伙可能会想占你便宜。”

Asuka was amazed at what he was referring to.  
明日香对他所指的事情感到惊讶。

"You were scared that I might have been raped?" she whispered.  
“你担心我可能被强奸了？”她低声问道。

"Yeah," he mumbled. “嗯，”他含糊地应道。

She was touched by his chivalrousness but didn't want to admit it.  
她被他的骑士精神所感动，但不想承认这一点。

"Idiot, I can take care of myself." Frowning at him, she continued with, "Thanks though, I guess...or...well...yeah"  
"傻瓜，我自己能照顾好自己。" 她皱着眉头对他说，接着又补充道，"不过，还是谢谢了，我想...或者...嗯...好吧"

It was a little awkward for the two of them. Barely three hours ago they had been looking daggers at each other. Shinji took this moment to hand her her bag and also give her the spare coat.  
对他们两人来说，这有点尴尬。仅仅三个小时前，他们还彼此怒目而视。真嗣趁这个机会递给她她的包，还把备用外套给了她。

She looked at him, surprised at the thoughtfulness of this and took it without question. Though when she put it on she started shivering worse than ever.  
她惊讶于他的体贴，毫不犹豫地接过那件衣物。然而，当她穿上后，却开始比之前颤抖得更厉害。

"Is something wrong," he asked?  
“有什么不对劲吗？”他问道。

"Of course idiot, this thing is soaking wet. I felt better without it."  
“当然，傻瓜，这东西湿透了。不穿还好些。”

"Well, then take mine. It's warmer."  
"那好吧，用我的。我的更暖和。"

"With your body touching it, not a chance."  
"你那身体贴着它，别想了。"

"Oh just deal with it Asuka. Your freezing cold."  
"哎，别抱怨了，明日香。你冷得要命。"

"Fine," she snapped at him.  
"好吧，"她厉声对他说。

They both looked at the ground for a while before Shinji said, "Come on lets go back. Misato's worried sick about you."  
他们俩都盯着地面好一会儿，然后真嗣说："走吧，我们回去。美里担心得要命。"

"No, I still don't want to live in the same house as you."  
"不，我还是不想和你住在同一个屋檐下。"

"What, you have another place to go, or where you planning to sleep outside?"  
"怎么，你有别的地方可去，还是打算露宿街头？"

Asuka flushed angrily at what he said about her not having a place to sleep. "Anythings better than having to share an apartment with you, idiot."  
听到他说她无处可睡，明日香气得脸红。"总比和你这个白痴共住一个公寓强。"

"Fine then," sighed Shinji. "Have fun spending the night under a cardboard box."  
"好吧，"真嗣叹了口气。"祝你睡纸箱愉快。"

He turned to leave but felt her grab onto his wrist. He smiled slightly, 'Hmph figures.'  
他转身欲走，却感觉她抓住了他的手腕。他微微一笑，'哼，意料之中。'

She spun him around with surprising force and gave him something reminiscent of a smile. "Fine, you win, idiot. I'll stay at Misato's place until I find a proper place to stay. However," and here her tone turned deathly cold. "If I ever catch you sneaking into my room in the middle of the night, or peeking at me in the shower, I'll be sure to kick you so hard in the balls you'll have to have them surgically removed out of your ass."  
她以惊人的力量将他转过身来，给了他一个类似微笑的表情。"好吧，你赢了，傻瓜。我会暂时住在美里那里，直到找到合适的地方。不过，"说到这里，她的语气变得极其冰冷。"如果我再发现你半夜溜进我房间，或者偷看我洗澡，我一定会狠狠踢你的蛋蛋，让你不得不从屁股里做手术取出来。"

She walked past him, but not before giving him a light jab on his shoulder. 'What did I just do,' asked Shinji to himself? 'I actually convinced her to stay. I must be loosing my mind. I won't last till sunrise.'  
她从他身边走过，临走前轻轻戳了一下他的肩膀。'我刚才做了什么？' 真嗣自问。'我居然说服她留下来了。我一定是疯了。我撑不到天亮了。'

---

Asuka arrived back at Misato's apartment a little ahead of Shinji. Shinji hadn't wanted to give her an excuse to start physically abusing him again and walked several paces behind her.  
明日香比真嗣早一步回到了美里小姐的公寓。真嗣不想给她再次动手打自己的借口，于是故意落后她几步。

When Asuka walked back into Misato's apartment Misato threw her arms around Asuka and gave her a big hug. Shinji arrived back in time to see this and had to suppress a grin. 'Maybe it wont be so bad. Having her stay here.'  
当明日香走进美里小姐的公寓时，美里张开双臂给了她一个大大的拥抱。真嗣刚好赶到，看到这一幕，忍不住想笑。'也许她住在这里不会太糟糕。'

Misato let go of Asuka and now walked over to Shinji and gave him the same big hug. Shinji felt that his back was about ready to split in two. He looked over Misato's shoulder and saw that Asuka was laughing at him silently. The difference it brought to her features was astounding. Where before their had been moody, angry German girl, their now stood someone who seemed rather friendly, Shinji smirked at her slightly. Seeing this Asuka stopped laughing and gave him a scowl before she walked past them, to her room and slammed the sliding door to a close only to have it bounce back open.  
美里放开明日香，走向真嗣，同样给了他一个大大的拥抱。真嗣感觉自己的背快要被压断了。他透过美里的肩膀看到明日香在无声地嘲笑他。她的表情变化令人惊叹。之前还是个阴沉、愤怒的德国女孩，现在却显得相当友好。真嗣微微对她笑了笑。看到这一幕，明日香停止了笑声，瞪了他一眼，然后走过他们，回到自己的房间，用力拉上推拉门，结果门又弹了回来，敞开着。

"DAMN JAPANESE DOORS! CAN'T I EVEN GET SOME PRIVACY!? I'M GONNA NEED TO GET A LOCK ON THIS THING TO KEEP THAT IDIOT OUT!"  
"该死的日本门！我连一点隐私都得不到吗？！我得在这东西上装个锁，把那个白痴挡在外面！"

Shinji just laughed at her outburst and walked to his own room feeling suddenly tired. Flopping down on his own futon he couldn't help but feel slightly happy that he would be living together with Asuka. Rolling over onto his side he turned of his SDAT and fell asleep.  
真嗣只是对她的大喊大笑，然后走向自己的房间，突然感到疲惫。他扑倒在榻榻米上，忍不住感到一丝高兴，因为他将与明日香同住。翻身侧躺，他关掉了 SDAT，沉沉睡去。

Lilith sat with her back against the Tree of Life, staring forward across the empty plane, her thoughts residing on Shinji and where his actions would take him. Whether she herself had orchestrated things so that it would reach this conclusion, she didn't know. She had affected both there lives to a certain extent, but ultimately, they had always seemed to have been drawn together ever since they had first met those many months ago. Even if Shinji wasn't an angel, that the Evangelions had never existed, that herself and Adam had never warred with each other, Lilith knew that Shinji and Asuka would still have connected as they did. She had to admit...she was jealous in a way; the two of them had something that she had never had. Well, that wasn't quite true she supposed...  
莉莉丝背靠着生命之树坐着，凝视着前方空荡荡的位面，她的思绪集中在真嗣身上，以及他的行动将带他走向何方。到底是不是她自己精心策划的，才会导致这样的结果，她不知道。她在一定程度上影响了两人的生活，但最终，自从几个月前第一次见面以来，他们似乎总是被吸引在一起。即使真嗣不是天使，即使新世纪福音战士从未存在过，即使她自己和亚当从未交战过，莉莉丝也知道真嗣和明日香仍然会像他们一样联系在一起。她不得不承认……她在某种程度上是嫉妒的；她嫉妒了。他们两个拥有了她从未拥有过的东西。嗯，她认为这并不完全正确……

Lilith titled her head upwards, looking at the dark sky devoid of any stars. She wondered how Shinji would fair inside the Black Egg. It was very easy to get lost within the sea of people, all of which were the same. But Shinji loved Asuka enough, and that alone would be enough to find her. After that though...  
莉莉丝抬起头，望着没有星星的漆黑天空。她想知道真嗣在黑蛋里会怎样。人海里很容易迷失方向，所有人都一样。但真嗣足够爱明日香，仅此一点就足以找到她。但在那之后...

"Hey...Rei?" mumbled Lilith as she continued looking upward.  
「喂……雷？」莉莉丝一边低声说道，一边继续向上看。

From within her, Rei replied.  
丽从内心深处回答道。

"Are you still having doubts about those two?"  
“你对那两个人还有疑问吗？”

"Even if Asuka does agree to returning, the damage has already been done, both inside and out. Even though I promised Shinji that I would help, the only thing I can help with is-"  
「即使明日香同意回来，内里外外的伤害都已经造成了。虽然我答应真嗣会帮忙，但我唯一能帮忙的就是——」

"They will be able to shoulder that hardship, even if it does torment them for years to come. I have faith in them. Shinji and Asuka are entwined together as you thought so much so that one can't live without the other."  
“他们将能够承受这种困难，即使这会在未来的岁月里折磨他们。我对他们有信心。真嗣和明日香是纠缠在一起的，因为你想得太多了，以至于一个人不能没有另一个人生活。”

"Do you have any idea why that is? You were able to observe them better than I was after all."  
“你知道这是为什么吗？你毕竟比我能更好地观察它们。”

"I can only say that they are connected in a way rarely seen by humans in this day and age. They are very much incomplete, but together, they are more whole. They make up for each others faults and problems, and are able to understand each other because they share similarities. Love doesn't describe there bond so much as the need to be close to each other. Even if they had just stayed friends, they would have still desired that warmth of being near."  
“我只能说，它们以当今时代人类很少见的方式联系在一起。它们非常不完整，但组合在一起，它们就更完整了。它们弥补了彼此的缺点和问题，并且能够彼此理解，因为他们有相似之处。爱并不更多地描述了彼此之间的联系，即使他们只是朋友，他们仍然渴望接近的温暖。”

"Was there ever a possibility of them breaking apart?"  
“他们有分手的可能吗？”

"Even now that possibility still exists, but Shinji should be able to negate that. His actions have driven them this far after all."  
「虽然现在这种可能性仍然存在，但真嗣应该能够否定这种可能性。毕竟是他的行为让他们走到了这一步。」

Lilith was silent now, as Rei finished speaking, but something still lingered on her mind.  
雷说完，莉莉丝沉默了，但她的脑海里仍然残留着一些东西。

"Rei, I consider you as much a part of my mind as I do myself...so what will happen to Shinji after him and Asuka return."  
“丽，我认为你就像我自己一样是我思想的一部分……那么他和明日香回来后真嗣会发生什么。”

"Meaning?" “意义？”

"After I...help them I mean..."  
“在我……帮助他们之后，我的意思是……”

Rei did not reply for a long while here, and seemed to be deep in thought over something which had troubled her for a long while. Eventually though, she voiced her thoughts on the matter.  
丽在这里良久没有回复，似乎正在思考一件困扰她许久的事情。但最终，她还是表达了自己对此事的看法。

"I understand what you are getting at, and that will not change, so the possibility would exist."  
“我明白你的意思，这一点不会改变，所以这种可能性是存在的。”

"I see," sighed Lilith glumly. If possible, she didn't want something like that to happen, as it could send everything into turmoil once again, but that wouldn't be her decision after all. That would be something Shinji and Asuka would have to deal with when the time came, if it ever did of course.  
“我明白了，”莉莉丝闷闷不乐地叹了口气。如果可以的话，她不希望这样的事情发生，因为这会让一切再次陷入混乱，但这毕竟不是她的决定。这将是真嗣和明日香到时候必须处理的事情，当然，如果确实如此的话。

Shinji had never given much thought as to how many people lived on the earth, but having several billions people talking to you all at once put it into perspective. It was like having a constant ache in your ear, unable to get ride of it. Everybody recognize Shinji for who he was, an entity that was unique for everyone else, somebody that could help him. Some even ridiculed him, yelling at him, screaming for him to help them. But Shinji couldn't do anything for them. Visions and such flashed by him, but everything was so blurred and meshed together that he couldn't tell any one person apart from anyone else.  
真嗣从来没有过多考虑过地球上有多少人，但有数十亿人同时与你交谈，你就可以正确地看待这个问题了。就好像你的耳朵经常疼痛，无法缓解。每个人都认识真嗣，他是一个对其他人而言独一无二的个体，一个可以帮助他的人。有些人甚至嘲笑他，对他大喊大叫，尖叫着要他帮助他们。但真嗣却无法为他们做任何事。幻象之类的东西在他眼前一闪而过，但一切都是那么模糊、交织在一起，让他分不清谁是谁。

He continued moving forward through the sea of LCL fluid, floating helplessly as he let it carry him forward. He kept thinking of Asuka, hoping that his thoughts would carry him to wherever she was, but he his mind kept on being assaulted by everyone else's thoughts. He saw mothers, fathers, children, grandfathers and grandmothers. He saw people of all kinds of nationalities, religions, and races. Personalities meshed together like a melting pot, making Shinji's head feeling like splitting. But he had to move forward, because Asuka was somewhere within here.  
他继续在拼箱液的海洋中前行，无助地漂浮着，让它带着他前进。他一直想着明日香，希望他的思绪能把他带到她所在的任何地方，但他的思绪不断受到其他人的思绪的攻击。他看到了母亲、父亲、孩子、祖父和祖母。他见过各种国籍、宗教和种族的人。不同的性格就像一个大熔炉一样交织在一起，让真嗣的头仿佛要裂开了。但他必须继续前进，因为明日香就在这里面的某个地方。

What would he say when he saw her? "I'm sorry for not telling you I loved you sooner? Sorry that I caused all this? Sorry that I caused all your pain and suffering?" That wouldn't cut it. Shinji wanted to say these things though, even if Asuka still hated him. He wanted to be truthful and heartfelt for once, instead of always running away from everything. He had been running away from everything all his life, never truly standing and facing it. But now, he just wanted to be with Asuka, even if she rejected him, even if she loathed him. He just wanted to say those three simple words to her.  
当他看到她时，他会说什么？ “对不起，我没有早点告诉你我爱你？对不起，我造成了这一切？对不起，我造成了你所有的痛苦和磨难？”那不会削减它。尽管明日香仍然讨厌他，但真嗣还是想说这些。他想要一次真诚和真心，而不是总是逃避一切。他一生都在逃避一切，从未真正站起来、面对它。但现在，他只想和明日香在一起，哪怕她拒绝他，哪怕她厌恶他。他只想对她说这简单的三个字。

This thought is what kept Shinji sane as he continued through the sea of LCL fluid.  
这个想法让真嗣在拼箱液体的海洋中继续前行时保持理智。

'Who am I?' '我是谁？'

'You are you and no one else.'  
“你就是你，没有别人。”

'What makes up the fact that I am me?'  
“什么构成了我就是我这个事实？”

'What do you mean?' '你是什么意思？'

'How do I know that I am me and not someone else?'  
“我怎么知道我就是我，而不是别人？”

'Why do you think you are someone else?'  
“你为什么认为你是别人？”

'I don't think that but...things don't feel right...'  
“我不这么认为，但是……事情感觉不太对劲……”

'What doesn't feel right?'  
“什么感觉不对劲？”

'I don't feel right.' “我感觉不对劲。”

'Does it hurt?' “痛吗？”

'It does...it hurts a lot. This pain...I-I've felt it before, and...I don't like it.'  
‘确实……很疼。这种疼痛……我、我以前感受过，而且……我不喜欢它。

'So you think something is...missing?'  
“那么你认为有什么东西……丢失了？”

'I do...but I don't know what...'  
“我愿意……但我不知道什么……”

'What exactly hurts?' “到底是什么痛？”

'...My heart...a constant pain in my heart, like a fist is clenching ahold of it.'  
“……我的心……我的心持续疼痛，就像一只拳头紧握着一样。”

'Maybe you lost something?'  
“也许你丢了什么东西？”

'I...lost something? But what?'  
‘我……丢了什么东西？但什么？

'That is for you to figure out, not me.'  
“这是你要弄清楚的，而不是我。”

Asuka opened her eyes into whiteness.  
明日香睁开眼睛，眼前一片惨白。

She was floating...no laying within a vast empty space of whiteness that seemed to stretch onward forever. She sat up, and looked around, searching for any distinguishing figure, but everything was still white.  
她漂浮着……不是躺在一片巨大的白色空间里，那片空间似乎永远向前延伸。她坐起身来，环顾四周，寻找任何明显的人影，但一切仍然是白色的。

"Where am I?" she wondered.  
“我在哪里？”她想知道。

Her voice, instead of echoing, seemed to be swallowed by the whiteness.  
她的声音不但没有回响，反而像是被白色吞噬了。

Standing up, she firstly noticed that she was naked, but this didn't seem to bother her for some reason. She ran her hands along her body, remembering the feel of it. Things were starting to come back to her. She placed a hand between her breasts, shuddering as she recalled the feel of the Lance of Longinus as it impaled her. She then ran her hand behind her head, running it through her hair. She also remembered the instantaneous death that had killed her. The pain, the horror, the feel of slipping away, and-  
站起来，她首先注意到自己赤身裸体，但不知为何，她似乎并没有对此感到困扰。她用手抚摸着自己的身体，回忆着那种感觉。她的心开始回过神来。她将一只手放在胸前，回想起朗基努斯之枪刺穿她的感觉，她不寒而栗。然后她把手放在脑后，梳理头发。她还记得杀死她的瞬间死亡。痛苦、恐惧、溜走的感觉，还有——

"Shinji," whispered Asuka.  
“真嗣，”明日香低声说道。

As she spoke his name, her heart seared with pain, bringing her to her knees. Her eyes opened wide as she remembered that last feel of his touch before she had been killed. The warmth that had passed between them, it felt so familiar.  
当她说出他的名字时，她的心一阵剧痛，让她跪倒在地。当她想起她被杀之前他最后一次触摸的感觉时，她睁大了眼睛。他们之间传递的温暖，感觉是那么熟悉。

Once again, Asuka's heart seared at this thought.  
想到这里，明日香的心再次变得灼热起来。

'What is wrong with me?' wondered Asuka.  
'我是怎么了？'明日香想知道。

Asuka stood up again, and started walking aimlessly in one direction, still looking for any noticeable landmark, but she seemed to be the only person within this space.  
明日香再次站起来，漫无目的地朝一个方向走去，仍在寻找任何明显的地标，但这个空间里似乎只有她一个人。

'Lonely again...huh?' thought Asuka sadly as she paused and looked around her. But hadn't that been how everything always was? She had never had friends in high school or college, and her father had always abused her. She had only ever had her Eva, but now that was even gone. And now with Shinji gone she was-  
“又孤独了……嗯？”明日香停下来环顾四周，悲伤地想。但一切不都是这样吗？她在高中或大学期间从未有过朋友，她的父亲总是虐待她。她曾经只有她的伊娃，但现在它甚至消失了。现在真嗣走了，她——

Asuka's heart ached with pain, but this time, her head felt like it had been cloven asunder as it brought her to the ground. She sank down, clutch both her hand and where her heart was. Everything about Shinji was-  
明日香的心一阵剧痛，但这一次，她的头就像被劈成两半一样，把她摔倒在地。她坐了下来，紧紧抓住自己的手和心脏所在的地方。关于真嗣的一切都是——

'If it hurts, then just don't think about it.'  
“如果很痛，那就别想了。”

'But I can't stop thinking about him,' replied Asuka as she felt pain hit her. 'After all, Shinji is someone that I-'  
“但我无法停止想他，”明日香回答道，她感到疼痛袭来。 “毕竟，真嗣是我——”

Asuka opened her eyes and looked around wildly. For a split second, she had thought she saw...no, she did see something. A bubble, completely round was floating effortlessly in the vast whiteness. Asuka stared at it for a long, while not believing what she was seeing. But as Asuka continued watching, several bubbles continued appearing, one right after the other in front of her until the entire place was filled with these strange bubbles.  
明日香睁开眼睛，疯狂地环顾四周。有那么一瞬间，她以为自己看到了……不，她确实看到了一些东西。一个浑圆的气泡，在浩瀚的白色之中，毫不费力地漂浮着。明日香盯着它看了很久，不敢相信自己所看到的。但随着明日香继续观察，几个气泡不断出现，一个接一个地出现在她的面前，直到整个地方都充满了这些奇怪的气泡。

Asuka stood up slowly, staring at the bubbles around her. As one neared her, she moved away from it, though as it passed her, she noticed something inside of it. Looking closer, she saw images flashing inside it.  
明日香缓缓站起身来，盯着周围的气泡。当其中一个靠近她时，她就远离它，但当它经过她时，她注意到里面有什么东西。仔细一看，她发现里面有影像在闪烁。

'Thats...me? And Misato? And...Shin...ji?"  
'这就是我？还有美里呢？还有……真……？”

Asuka gazed at the bubble, inside which showed herself, Misato, and Shinji, all gathered around the kitchen table of Misato apartment and eating breakfast. Both Shinji and Asuka were in there school uniforms, and Misato seemed to be about ready to leave for Nerv. Asuka watched as she yelled something at Shinji, who promptly stood up and grabbed something from the fridge. The her inside the bubble then said something else, making Shinji retort back as well. Very quickly, the two started arguing with each other across the kitchen table, while Misato seemed to be completely oblivious to this, making it apparent that it happened all to frequently.  
明日香凝视着气泡，里面出现了她自己、美里和真嗣，他们都围在美里公寓的厨房桌子旁吃着早餐。真嗣和明日香都穿着校服，美里似乎正准备出发去涅夫。明日香看着她对真嗣大喊大叫，真嗣立刻站起来，从冰箱里抓起一样东西。泡泡里的她又说了些什么，真嗣也反驳道。很快，两人就隔着餐桌争吵起来，而美里似乎完全没有注意到这一点，显然这一切都发生得很频繁。

"Is this...my memory?" mumbled Asuka as she reached towards the bubble. As her fingers touched it, it immediately popped, clear fluid like tear drops falling from it.  
“这……是我的记忆吗？”明日香一边向泡泡伸出手，一边咕哝道。当她的手指触碰到它的时候，它立刻爆开，透明的液体如泪珠般从里面流了下来。

Asuka felt something then, almost like a jolt of some sorts, like something had just struck her. A shiver ran down her back, and she had to wrap her arms around her body to prevent herself from shivering.  
明日香感觉到了什么，几乎像​​是某种震动，就像有什么东西刚刚击中了她。她的后背一阵颤抖，她不得不用双臂抱住自己的身体，才不至于发抖。

But she remembered now...that day. So Shinji had lived with her at Misato's apartment.  
但她现在想起来了……那天。所以真嗣和她一起住在美里的公寓里。

"Then all of these...all of these are my memories?"  
“那这一切……都是我的记忆？”

Asuka looked at all of them, and saw that all of them had one thing in common: they all had Shinji in them.  
明日香看着他们所有人，发现他们都有一个共同点：他们都有真嗣。

"These are...the memories I lost?"  
“这些就是……我失去的记忆？”

Asuka watched as her memories floated by her, each with Shinji in them. She saw her and Shinji at school, in the apartment, and even fighting angels.  
明日香看着她的记忆从她身边飘过，每一个记忆里都有真嗣。她在学校、在公寓、甚至在战斗天使中都看到了她和真嗣。

Asuka then noticed a particular memory, showing her and Shinji sitting side by side and listening to something that looked like a tape recorder. She reached her hands towards this one, and touched it briefly with her index finger. It immediately popped, and she was assaulted again by a strange jolt, but the memories that flowed from this were startling, and Asuka surprisingly found herself laughing.  
明日香随后注意到了一段特殊的记忆，显示她和真嗣并排坐着，听着类似录音机的东西。她把手伸向这个，用食指轻轻触碰了一下。它立即弹出，她再次受到一种奇怪的震动的袭击，但由此产生的记忆令人震惊，明日香惊讶地发现自己笑了。

She was remembering when her and Shinji had to be completely synchronized with each other to defeat the fifth angel. The torment of having to do everything together, that damn machine, the stupid clothes they had to wear for the entire thing...and of course, sleeping in the same room. But it made Asuka smile slightly, as she knew that things were much easier then than now.  
她记得她和真嗣必须完全同步才能击败第五天使。必须一起做所有事情的折磨，那台该死的机器，他们必须穿着愚蠢的衣服来完成整个事情……当然，还有睡在同一个房间。但这让明日香微微一笑，因为她知道那时候的事情比现在容易多了。

But-

"What is this?" mumbled Asuka in shock.  
“这是什么？”明日香震惊地嘟哝道。

She had just remembered when her father had come looking for her.  
她这才想起来，父亲来找她的时候。

This time, Asuka's heart hurt in a different way, bringing up memories she had long sealed within herself. She felt nauseous, sick with pain as she saw herself stand there in shock, saw as Shinji stood there defending her, pure hatred etched into his face. Another memory, another memory must have existed before this.  
这一次，明日香的心以不同的方式疼痛，唤起了她封印已久的记忆。当她看到自己震惊地站在那里，看到真嗣站在那里保护她时，她感到恶心，疼痛难忍，脸上刻满了纯粹的仇恨。另一种记忆，另一种记忆在此之前一定已经存在了。

Fighting off the sense of worry that plagued her now, Asuka searched for a memory which could tie the two together. She found one that caught her attention almost instantly. In the memory, she saw herself pressing her face against Shinji's shoulder, tears running down her face. Shinji had his hands wrapped around her waist as he comforted her. Whatever it was...Asuka was nervous about the memory, but her desire to know what happened won her over.  
明日香奋力摆脱现在困扰她的忧虑，寻找能够将两人联系在一起的记忆。她几乎立刻就发现了一个引起她注意的东西。记忆中，她看见自己把脸贴在真嗣的肩膀上，泪水顺着脸颊流下来。真嗣双手环住她的腰，安抚着她。不管是什么……明日香对这段记忆感到紧张，但她想知道发生了什么的渴望赢得了她的支持。

She touched it, and felt a fresh flood of memories hit her.  
她摸了摸它，感觉一股新鲜的记忆涌向她。

Herself and Shinji were talking about themselves openly, seemingly for the first time. Asuka told Shinji all about growing up with her father, and the torment that she had undergone until she left for college. Asuka felt the weakness hit her as she remembered how she had felt when she had broken down and cried into Shinji's shoulder. Her knees wobbled slightly, and she had to prevent herself from falling.  
她自己和真嗣似乎是第一次公开谈论自己。明日香向真嗣讲述了她和父亲一起长大的一切，以及她在上大学之前所经历的折磨。当明日香想起自己崩溃并靠在真嗣肩头哭泣时的感受时，她感到全身无力。她的膝盖微微颤抖，她必须防止自己跌倒。

"So...Shinji already knew about my father before they met," gasped Asuka as she pressed a hand against her chest.  
“所以……真嗣在他们见面之前就已经知道我父亲了，”明日香喘着气说道，她一只手按在胸前。

But what happened then? Asuka thought back to when her father had answered the door. She had been scared, because her father wanted to talk to her, but Shinji wasn't going to allow it. But then what? Everything else afterwards was one giant blank. And how was this possible? She didn't remember ever meeting her father, nor had Misato or anyone else even bothered to mention that he had showed up.  
但后来发生了什么？明日香回想起父亲开门的时候。她很害怕，因为她的父亲想和她说话，但真嗣不允许。但然后呢？之后的一切都是一片巨大的空白。这怎么可能呢？她不记得曾经见过她的父亲，美里或其他人甚至懒得提及他曾出现过。

Something must have happened...  
一定是发生了什么事情……

Asuka turned back to her memories, searching for something she didn't want to find, but she had to know. She had to know what had happened with her and Shinji.  
明日香回到记忆中，寻找着一些她不想找到，但又必须知道的东西。她必须知道她和真嗣之间发生了什么。

She looked around again, looking for anything that might speak to her. What would it be though? Asuka saw many memories, most seemingly just day to day things involving Shinji. Some intrigued her though, but it didn't seem to be one she was looking for, but she marked it all the same, wanting to come back to it later.  
她再次环顾四周，寻找任何可能对她说话的东西。那会是什么？明日香看到了很多记忆，大部分似乎只是与真嗣有关的日常事务。虽然有些东西引起了她的兴趣，但这似乎不是她要找的东西，但她还是做了标记，想稍后再回来看。

One jumped out at her though. She saw herself walking up the steps of Misato's apartment, rain lashing against her shoulders. She was wearing a sleeveless shirt with jeans cut off at the knees and a pair of sandals, something that suitable for the rain. Asuka watched as she walked to Misato's door and knocked on it. Several seconds later, the door was flung open, and Shinji stood there.  
不过，有一个人向她跳了过来。她看见自己走上美里公寓的台阶，雨水拍打着她的肩膀。她穿着一件无袖衬衫，搭配膝盖处剪裁的牛仔裤，脚上是一双适合下雨天穿的凉鞋。明日香看着她走到美里的门前，敲响了门。几秒后，门被推开，真嗣站在那里。

Asuka didn't have to look any further to know this was the memory she was looking for.  
明日香不用再看就知道这就是她要找的记忆。

She reached out with timid fingers, and touched it.  
她胆怯地伸出手指，触碰了它。

She was immediately hit by a sense of cold, as though she herself had just been splashed with ice cold water. The rest of the memory came to her. She remembered how Shinji had held her as she broke down completely, repeatedly saying his name more desperately than before. The next part made her blush a little though. She saw as Shinji fought her out of her soggy wet clothes, but let out a sigh as she remembered taking things into her own hands. If Shinji had continued, Asuka would have died of embarrassment.  
她顿时感觉浑身冰凉，就好像自己被泼了一盆冰水。剩下的记忆又浮现在她的脑海里。她记得当她彻底崩溃时，真嗣抱着她，比以前更加绝望地一遍又一遍地喊着他的名字。接下来的部分却让她脸红了一些。她看到真嗣把她从湿漉漉的衣服中挣脱出来，但当她想起自己把事情掌握在自己手中时，她叹了口气。如果真嗣继续下去的话，明日香就会羞愧而死。

Afterwards, the explanation came, which Asuka admittedly didn't care about. Everything was fitting together so perfectly, but it still felt like she was remembering it all from a third perspective. It was hard to believe that this all had transpired.  
随后有解释，明日香承认对此并不在意。一切都那么完美地结合在一起，但她仍然感觉这一切都是从第三个角度来回忆的。很难相信这一切都发生了。

But what happened next. 但接下来发生了什么。

Everything was a blur suddenly.  
一切突然变得模糊起来。

Asuka saw as her father returned with Misato in tow. How he had said he wanted to talk to her, how she had stood up for herself. And then-  
明日香看到父亲带着美里回来了。他如何说他想和她谈谈，她如何为自己辩护。进而-

Asuka heard those words that her father had spoken, and before anything else, she saw Shinji crashing his fist against her fathers jaw. Asuka remembered hearing the sound of the bone snapping, the impact as Shinji's fist collided against the side of her fathers temple. The bright red color as blood spewed forth from his mouth. Asuka felt herself almost unable to deal with it, but a part of her also remembered the feeling from that time.  
明日香听到了父亲所说的话，然后首先看到真嗣用拳头猛击父亲的下巴。明日香记得听到骨头折断的声音，以及真嗣的拳头撞击到她父亲太阳穴侧面时的冲击力。鲜红的血液，从他的口中喷涌而出。明日香觉得自己几乎无法应对，但她的一部分也想起了当时的感觉。

It was one of relief, and she hated herself for feeling that now. She knew everything that her father had done to her, but he was still her father.  
这是一种解脱，她恨自己现在有这种感觉。她知道父亲对她所做的一切，但他仍然是她的父亲。

'Is it right to feel like this?' she wondered as she saw Misato attempt to reprimand Shinji, only to have him brush it off.  
“这样的感觉对吗？”当她看到美里试图斥责真嗣时，她感到很奇怪，但他却置若罔闻。

Surely it was understandable? But she couldn't help wonder where her father was at that moment.  
这当然是可以理解的吗？但她不禁想知道父亲此时在哪里。

Afterwards, Asuka remembered herself going into Shinji's room to seek comfort, though it had been awkward, and she remembered not being able to say what was truly on her mind then. She was saddened by this, sad that so many opportunities had come, but she had let them slip through her grasp.  
之后，明日香记得自己走进真嗣的房间寻求安慰，尽管这很尴尬，而且她记得当时无法说出自己真正的想法。她为此感到悲伤，悲伤的是这么多的机会来了，但她却让它们从她的手中溜走了。

She now took a deep breath, and opened and closed her eyes. As much as her memories intrigued her, they took a lot out of her. Remembering what she felt at the time was particularly exhausting.  
她现在深吸了一口气，睁开又闭上眼睛。尽管她的记忆让她着迷，但它们却让她失去了很多。回想起当时的感受，她特别心累。

Looking at her memories though, she noticed the ones from earlier that she had marked. Flashes of her and Shinji doing things filled the memory, and Asuka walked over to it, staring at it. She watched as her and Shinji went to an italian restaurant, ate ice cream, and walked around an exhibit of pre-Second Impact oceanic animals.  
不过，翻看她的记忆，她注意到了之前她标记过的那些。记忆中充满了她和真嗣做事的画面，明日香走过去，盯着它看。她看着她和真嗣去了一家意大利餐厅，吃了冰淇淋，并在第二次撞击前的海洋动物展览中散步。

'Is this...a date?' wondered Asuka as she continued looking at the memory. She slowly stretched her hand out to it, and grasped it.  
“这是……约会吗？”明日香一边思考着，一边继续看着记忆。她缓缓伸出手，握住了它。

Her mind was instantly filled with memories from that day. She saw as her and Shinji walked around the ocean exhibit, albeit not talking to each other for a while, though after a time, they seemed to make up. Then they entered a gift shop, and Asuka seem to realize something then, seconds before it happened. She was waiting outside when Shinji came out, and Asuka watched as he gave her the dolphin earrings that she treasured. Asuka felt tears well up at the corner of her eyes as she felt herself overcome with happiness, remembering the feelings that coursed through her at that moment in time. She watched as her and Shinji embraced each other; watched as she pressed her face against his shirt, and Shinji buried his face in her fiery hair.  
她的脑海里顿时充满了那天的回忆。她看到她和真嗣绕着海洋展览走来走去，虽然有一段时间没有互相交谈，但过了一段时间，他们似乎又和好了。然后他们进入了一家礼品店，明日香似乎在事情发生前几秒钟意识到了什么。当真嗣出来时，她正在外面等着，明日香看着他把她珍藏的海豚耳环交给了她。明日香回忆起那一刻的感受，眼角涌出泪水，幸福感溢于言表。她看着自己和真嗣拥抱在一起。看着她把脸贴在他的衬衫上，真嗣把脸埋进她火热的头发里。

And then Misato, Ritsuko, and Kaji showed up. Even now, Asuka knew that she shouldn't have done that. She had been embarrassed when they had seen herself and Shinji, and had immediately turned defensive.  
然后美里、律子和梶就出现了。即使现在，明日香也知道自己不应该这么做。当他们看到自己和真嗣时，她感到很尴尬，并立即变得防御起来。

She watched as they slowly made there way towards the beach, and the eventual water fight that ensued between them. Asuka remembered as they lay beside each other, talking aimlessly about meeting each other. Feelings were shared during that moment, even if they weren't spoken aloud. Afterwards though, when Asuka remembered what she had done, she blushed crimson. She remembered the feel as her lips came into contact with Shinji's forehead, and even though it was intended to be friendly, something was concealed in it.  
她看着他们慢慢地走向海滩，最后他们之间发生了水战。明日香记得他们躺在一起，漫无目的地谈论着见面的事。在那一刻，即使没有大声说出，人们也表达了自己的感受。但事后，明日香想起自己的所作所为，不禁脸红了。她记得自己的嘴唇接触真嗣额头时的感觉，虽然是出于友好，但其中却隐藏着某种东西。

She stood there, surrounded by her memories and she thought about what she had seen and felt so far. What Shinji had said before...when she had been alive, about them being friends...they had certainly been more than just friends. They had loved each other, even if it had never been spoken, and even now, they seemed to still love each other. So then why had Shinji lied again even at the end of everything? Was he still trying to protect her, or was he just trying to protect himself?  
她站在那里，周围都是她的回忆，她回想着迄今为止所见所感。真嗣之前说过……当她还活着的时候，他们是朋友……他们肯定不仅仅是朋友。他们曾经彼此相爱，即使从未说过，即使是现在，他们似乎仍然相爱。那么为什么真嗣在一切结束后又再次撒谎呢？他到底是想保护她，还是只是想保护自己？

Asuka shook her head as she thought back to that day and everything that had transpired. Everything that had happened was a clear example of who they were to each other. Even after she lost her memories, and Shinji denied everything that had happened, they still loved each other. So wasn't that enough? Shouldn't they just accept it? If you love someone, shouldn't you just express that love to the person you feel for?  
明日香摇了摇头，回想起那天以及所发生的一切。所发生的一切都清楚地表明了他们对彼此的看法。即使在她失去记忆、真嗣否认所发生的一切之后，他们仍然彼此相爱。那么这还不够吗？难道他们不应该接受吗？如果你爱一个人，你不应该向你所爱的人表达你的爱吗？

But they were also both fifteen, and had never known love of any form, so it was all so confusing.  
但他们也都十五岁了，从来不知道任何形式的爱情，所以这一切都是那么令人困惑。

Asuka looked back at her memories, now looking for one in particular. She wanted to find the one that had ended everything, the last memory before she had lost them. If she could trust what Ritsuko had said before, it had been an angel that had destroyed her memories of Shinji. So if she found something that looked like that-  
明日香回顾自己的记忆，现在正在寻找一个特别的记忆。她想要找到那个结束一切的人，找到她失去一切之前的最后一段记忆。如果她能相信律子之前所说的话，那么摧毁她关于真嗣的记忆的就是天使。所以如果她发现了类似的东西——

'Maybe this is it,' thought Asuka as she turned towards her right and saw one memory in particular. It didn't show Shinji, only herself enclosed in a white area, similar to the one she was in. She had her hands covering her head and was screaming something.  
“也许就是这样，”明日香想道，她转向右侧，看到了一个特别的记忆。它没有显示真嗣，只有她自己被包围在一个白色区域中，类似于她所在的区域。她双手捂着头，正在尖叫着什么。

Asuka neared this one, and looked at it closer. This was likely it...but remembering something like this, was that necessarily the best thing to do? Asuka continued staring at it, trying to understand the words she was saying. Something like this maybe...  
明日香靠近这个，仔细观察。大概就是这样……但是记住这样的事情，就一定是最好的事情吗？明日香继续盯着它，试图理解她所说的话。类似这样的事情也许...

But she reached forward anyway, and touched it.  
但她还是向前伸出手，触摸了它。

Pain exploded inside of Asuka's head. She screamed out, remembering the feel as her mind was violated, everything laid forth for the angel to see. Everything that she had ever happened during her childhood, she remembered, many things that she had done with Shinji, she saw and felt. And then-  
明日香的脑袋里一阵剧痛。她尖叫起来，回想起她的心灵被侵犯的感觉，一切都摆在天使面前。童年时发生的一切，她都记得，她和真嗣一起做过的许多事情，她都亲眼所见，感受到。进而-

Asuka's eyes turned white as the pain became unbearable. She felt hands touch her, running all along her body, grasping her painfully. She bit down on her tongue, preventing herself from screaming out. She saw a face, a horrible face which made her cringe, made her lose herself completely.  
疼痛变得难以忍受，明日香的眼睛变成了白色。她感觉到有双手抚摸着她，沿着她的身体，痛苦地抓着她。她咬住舌头，不让自己尖叫出来。她看到了一张脸，一张可怕的脸，让她感到畏缩，让她完全失去了自我。

And then it stopped. 然后它就停了。

Asuka fell to the ground, her body covered in sweat as she shivered uncontrollably. Everything...she had relived everything in a seconds notice, even things she didn't fully understand. She felt strange, disgusted, weak, violated. Her head hurt, her body hurt, her heart heart. Things were foggy, her recovered memories of Shinji blurred around the edges.  
明日香倒在地上，浑身都是汗，无法控制地颤抖着。一切……她在一瞬间就重温了一切，甚至是她不完全理解的事情。她感到奇怪、厌恶、软弱、被侵犯。她的头很痛，她的身体很痛，她的心也很痛。事情变得扑朔迷离，她恢复的有关真嗣的记忆也变得模糊起来。

'No...I don't want this...this pain,' thought Asuka.  
“不……我不想这样……这种痛苦，”明日香想。

'This is the price that comes with remembering everything again. You remember the good, and the bad.'  
“这就是再次记住一切的代价。”你会记住好的和坏的。

'No...no...' wined Asuka.  
“不……不……”明日香喝道。

From in front of her, came a memory unlike the others, a memory with no images, only black. Asuka saw this memory, and immediately knew that this was a bad memory, something that she never wanted to see. She stood up slowly, bracing herself as she did so. No matter what, she didn't want to know what-  
从她的面前，传来了一段与其他人不同的记忆，一段没有图像，只有黑色的记忆。明日香看到这段记忆，立刻就知道这是一段不好的记忆，是她永远不想看到的。她慢慢地站了起来，同时也做好了准备。无论如何，她不想知道什么——

The memory suddenly surged forward, enclosing Asuka's entire body in darkness. She was immediately thrown back to that time, that point in when she had been at her weakness. She saw the face, felt the breath of him, the feel as he touched her body. She wanted to scream out for help, but nobody was nearby, nobody to help her. He hit her repeatedly, tore at her body, mocked her. She wasn't going to make it...he was getting closer. The pain hit her; her heart cried out for help, her mind was growing hazy.  
记忆猛然向前涌动，将明日香的全身笼罩在黑暗之中。她立刻就被抛回到了那个时候，那个她最软弱的时候。她看到了他的脸，感觉到了他的呼吸，感觉到了他触碰她身体的感觉。她想大声呼救，但附近没有人，也没有人帮助她。他不断地打她，撕扯她的身体，嘲笑她。她不会成功的……他越来越近了。疼痛向她袭来；她的心在呼喊救命，她的思绪越来越模糊。

Bright light suddenly broke through the darkness, and Asuka saw Shinji standing there, an odd glow seeming to radiate off of him. His eyes glowed bright red as he marched towards the rapist. It happened in an orange flash of light. The body was torn asunder. Bone was crushed, limbs were shredded, fluid sprayed across the ground, and the head was turned into a ground meat.  
明亮的光芒突然冲破了黑暗，明日香看到真嗣站在那里，身上似乎散发着奇怪的光芒。当他走向强奸犯时，他的眼睛发出鲜红的光芒。事情发生在一道橙色的闪光中。身体被撕裂了。骨头被压碎，四肢被撕碎，液体喷洒在地上，头颅也变成了肉末。

Asuka shivered uncontrollably, her mind still hazy. This was...this was...  
明日香无法控制地颤抖着，她的大脑仍然一片混沌。这是……这是……

Something which should have stayed buried.  
一些本应被埋葬的东西。

The attempted rape, Shinji's ascension, the two things wove a web within Asuka's mind, preventing her to think of anything else. She could remember the feel of the hands, smell the blood, hear the crushing of the skull.  
强奸未遂，真嗣的升天，这两件事在明日香的脑海中编织了一张网，让她无法思考其他事情。她记得手的感觉、血的味道、头骨破碎的声音。

She felt like puking. 她感觉想吐。

How could she have forgotten something like this? But it was best that she had forgotten it...and now that she had.  
她怎么会忘记这样的事情？但最好她已经忘记了……现在她已经忘记了。

The feel...the feel of helplessness...even now it still.  
那种感觉……那种无助的感觉……至今依然如此。

"Shinji," mumbled Asuka as she sat there, staring at the white ground.  
“真嗣，”明日香坐在那里，盯着白色的地面，咕哝道。

It was overpowering her, that feel. Unable to do anything, never able to do a thing. Her father, the angel, the rapist. It all felt too real. She didn't know how to-  
那种感觉压倒了她。什么都做不了，什么都做不了。她的父亲，天使，强奸犯。这一切都感觉太真实了。她不知道如何——

Asuka suddenly felt her eyes lose focus. No! Not now! If you pass out now-  
明日香突然感觉自己的目光失去了焦点。不！现在不要！如果你现在昏倒了-

Asuka forced herself to fight the pain. She could beat it, she had before.  
明日香强迫自己对抗疼痛。她可以战胜它，她以前就做到了。

But that was because Shinji was with her, and now without him-  
但那是因为真嗣和她在一起，而现在他不在了——

Asuka tilted to her right, and fell to the ground, tears streaming from her eyes. Even if she could remember Shinji, having him by her side wasn't the same. If only she could feel him, know that he was still somewhere out there. But she didn't even know where was.  
明日香向右倾斜，倒在地上，泪水从眼中流淌出来。即使她记得真嗣，有他在她身边也不一样。如果她能感觉到他，知道他还在外面的某个地方就好了。但她根本不知道这是哪里。

Everything was too overpowering. Her memories held cherished thoughts, but they also held bitter ones, sad ones, ones that were too painful to think about. She wanted everything to just slip away. If this was how things would be, then she would rather not have remembered any of this.  
一切都太过势不可挡。她的记忆里有珍贵的想法，但也有苦涩的、悲伤的、痛苦不堪的想法。她希望一切就这么溜走。如果事情真的是这样，那她宁愿不记得这一切。

'It hurts,' mumbled Asuka. 'It hurts a lot.'  
“很痛。”明日香咕哝道。 '非常疼。'

And without anybody there to comfort her, Asuka slowly started to slip away...  
没有人安慰她，明日香慢慢地开始溜走……

---

Shinji was starting to get desperate. He had no idea how long it had been since he had entered the black sphere, but he still hadn't managed to find Asuka. What was he doing wrong? Why wasn't he able to find her. Was it impossible as Lilith had hinted at? But he was trying with everything he had damn it! If he wasn't able to find Asuka...  
真嗣开始绝望了。他不知道自己进入黑色球体已经有多久了，但他仍然没有找到明日香。他做错了什么？为什么他找不到她。难道真像莉莉丝暗示的那样不可能吗？但他正在竭尽全力地尝试！如果他找不到明日香的话……

'No, don't think like that,' Shinji told himself. 'Everything will be fine!'  
“不，不要这样想，”真嗣告诉自己。 '一切都会好起来的！'

But there was a small voice in the back of his mind that asked, 'What if?'  
但他内心深处有一个小小的声音问：“如果呢？”

Shinji didn't want to answer what if.  
真嗣不想回答“如果”的话。

The LCL fluid still seemed to have a mind of its own, and just carried him wherever it pleased. Even though Shinji had his mind on Asuka, it still didn't seem to be enough.  
拼箱液体似乎仍然有自己的意志，可以带着他去任何它想去的地方。尽管真嗣把心思放在明日香身上，但似乎还不够。

So then what did he have to do?  
那么他必须做什么呢？

Shinji had managed to tune most of the voices out by then, so that wasn't the problem here. It was like the LCL fluid didn't want him to go to where Asuka was.  
那时真嗣已经成功地消除了大部分声音，所以这不是这里的问题。就好像拼箱液不想让他去明日香所在的地方一样。

'Fuck that,' thought Shinji bitterly as he paused in the midst of the LCL fluid. He looked all around him, looking for anything that might help him. Asuka was somewhere within here right now, and Shinji new that she needed him. Some of her memories were best left untouched if at all possible, if she did remember them...  
“操，”真嗣在拼箱液体中间停了下来，痛苦地想。他环顾四周，寻找任何对他有帮助的东西。明日香现在就在这儿的某个地方，真嗣得知她需要他。如果可能的话，她的一些记忆最好不要被触及，如果她确实记得的话……

'Damn it,' thought Shinji.  
“该死，”真嗣想。

Now stationary, Shinji put all his thoughts into Asuka, and projected his AT-field outward, searching for her. The AT-field was an embodiment of who he is as a person, and with his feelings of Asuka projected into it, he should hopefully be able to find her.  
真嗣一动不动，将全部心思集中在明日香身上，向外投射AT力场，寻找她。 AT场是他这个人的体现，加上他对明日香的感情投射到其中，他应该有希望能够找到她。

But after many times of searching, Shinji didn't seem to be able to find Asuka. It was almost like she wasn't even there.  
但经过多次寻找，真嗣似乎都没有找到明日香。就好像她根本不存在一样。

'Is that possible though?' wondered Shinji. 'Could she be somewhere else?'  
“那可能吗？”真嗣想知道。 “她会不会在别的地方？”

But if she wasn't here, then where would she be?  
但如果她不在这里，那么她会在哪里？

'No, she had to be here, Lilith was sure of that much. But the problem is where. She likely sectioned herself off from everyone else, because of her grasp on herself, so that would mean-'  
“不，她必须在这里，莉莉丝确信这一点。但问题是在哪里。她很可能因为对自己的掌控而将自己与其他人隔离开来，所以这意味着——”

"Is there another part of this place?" mumbled Shinji. He didn't really see how there could be, unless Asuka had somehow created it herself.  
“这个地方还有别的地方吗？”真嗣咕哝道。他真的不明白怎么会有这种东西，除非明日香自己创造了它。

Shinji looked around him, but only saw LCL fluid that went on forever. But even so, the voices had diminished so that he didn't hear them as clearly anymore. It was like he had reached a different part of the sphere almost.  
真嗣环顾四周，却只看到了一直持续不断的拼箱液体。但即便如此，声音还是变小了，他听得不太清楚了。就好像他几乎到达了球体的另一个部分。

'More than anything else, I want to find Asuka right. To find her...and tell her anything. If those feelings aren't strong enough...'  
“最重要的是，我想找到明日香的正确身份。找到她……并告诉她任何事情。如果这些感觉还不够强烈的话……”

Once again, Shinji projected his AT-field outward, this time in a different direction.  
真嗣再一次向外投射他的AT力场，这次是在不同的方向。

'Asuka...Asuka...where are you right now? Are you lonely? What are you doing right now? What are you thinking? I want to see you...'  
“明日香……明日香……你现在在哪里？你孤单吗？你现在在做什么？你在想什么？我要见你...'

Shinji felt something strike his heart then, heard something almost echo inside of him. What was it? Something that was conjured up, something from a long time ago. A memory? Yes, a memory! A certain feel? A certain warmth? Between two people? The feel of embracing, the feel of kissing, the feel of love?  
真嗣感到有什么东西击中了他的心，几乎听到了他内心深处的回声。它以前如何？一些被召唤出来的东西，一些很久以前的东西。记忆？是的，一段回忆！某种感觉？某种温暖？两个人之间？拥抱的感觉，亲吻的感觉，爱的感觉？

Shinji's eyes darted towards a certain spot within the LCL fluid. Maybe it was simply the angel half of him speaking up, or it was something more human reacting to it, but this spot felt...unnatural almost.  
真嗣的目光飞向拼箱液体中的某个地方。也许这只是他一半的天使在说话，或者是一些更人性的反应，但这个地方感觉……几乎不自然。

Shinji paused in front of it, and ran a hand over the air. Nothing happened, but Shinji felt as though his hand had passed through something. Moving forward, and walked through what could only be described as a curtain of water. LCL fluid filled this entire space also, but in the center of it, floating unsupportably was-  
真嗣在它面前停了下来，伸出一只手在空中抚摸。什么都没发生，但真嗣感觉自己的手好像穿过了什么东西。继续往前走，走过了只能用水幕来形容的地方。拼箱液体也充满了整个空间，但在它的中央，却难以支撑地漂浮着——

"Asuka!" “飞鸟！”

Shinji moved forward, guided by his thoughts until he reached Asuka. He stretched out his hand, and caressed her face gently. She was unusually cold.  
真嗣在思绪的引导下向前移动，直到到达明日香面前。他伸出手，轻轻抚上她的脸。她异常冷漠。

"...Asuka," repeated Shinji. It felt like an eternity since he had seen her. But something was wrong. Her eyes were closed, and she wasn't moving.  
“……明日香，”真嗣重复道。自从见到她以来，他感觉就像过了一个世纪。但出了点问题。她的眼睛紧闭着，一动不动。

Without a second thought, Shinji projected his AT-field over her, and immediately noticed a change within her. Some of her memories had returned, some of which he had wished hadn't. He winced horribly and felt a low throb in his heart as he remembered his anger and rage over a certain event.  
真嗣不假思索地将AT力场投射到她身上，并立即注意到她体内的变化。她的一些记忆已经恢复，其中一些他希望没有。当他想起自己对某件事的愤怒和愤怒时，他猛地皱起眉头，心里一阵低沉的抽动。

But if she had remembered memories like that...  
但如果她还记得那样的记忆的话……

'You may not like the outcome.'  
“你可能不喜欢这个结果。”

Lilith's words echoed inside his head.  
莉莉丝的话在他脑海中回响。

If he didn't like the outcome, then he would just change it. Wasn't that what he had been doing for the longest time now after all?  
如果他不喜欢这个结果，那么他就会改变它。这不正是他已经做了很长时间的事了吗？

Shinji closed his eyes, and blended his AT-field with Asuka's. If any two people had tried this, it likely would not have worked. But since these two individuals were able to understand and love each other, it was able to work.  
真嗣闭上眼睛，将自己的AT力场与明日香的融合起来。如果任何两个人尝试过这一点，很可能都不会成功。但由于这两个人能够相互理解和相爱，所以它能够发挥作用。

Shinji slowly felt his mind start to fade as he entered into Asuka's thoughts. He only hoped that this decision was the right one.  
当真嗣进入明日香的思绪时，他慢慢地感觉到自己的思绪开始模糊。他只希望这个决定是正确的。

---

Shinji opened his eyes, taking several seconds to adjust to the light; everything was a whiteness that went on forever. Shinji stood up and looked down at his body, noticing that he was naked, but not caring that much.  
真嗣睁开了眼睛，花了几秒钟才适应了光线。一切都是一片白色，永远持续下去。真嗣站起来，低头看着自己的身体，发现他赤身裸体，但并没有太在意。

As he looked around he didn't see any defining features. He didn't even see Asuka in this emptiness. But she had to be here somewhere.  
当他环顾四周时，他没有看到任何明显的特征。在这片空虚中，他甚至没有看到明日香。但她必须在这儿的某个地方。

Shinji started moving forward, turning every which way as he went, searching for some sign of Asuka. Once or twice, he tried sending out his AT-field, but he supposed that was impractical right now.  
真嗣开始向前走，边走边转，寻找明日香的踪迹。有一两次，他尝试发出他的 AT 场，但他认为现在这是不切实际的。

'Just how big is this place exactly?' wondered Shinji.  
“这个地方到底有多大？”真嗣想知道。

As Shinji thought this, he saw something which made him rub his eyes, thinking he was tired. A bubble was floating along in the air, a bubble which was flashes images of himself. Shinji stared at this for a long while, watching it as it passed him. Shinji then turned towards the direction of where it had came from, and saw many other bubbles like it.  
正当真嗣这么想的时候，他看到了一些东西，让他揉了揉眼睛，以为自己累了。空气中漂浮着一个气泡，一个气泡中闪烁着他自己的影像。真嗣盯着它看了很久，看着它从他身边经过。真嗣转头看向它来的方向，看到了许多类似的气泡。

'Are these Asuka's memories?' thought Shinji.  
“这些是明日香的记忆吗？”真嗣想。

As Shinji rushed in the direction the memories came from, he noticed all of them had something to do with him, ones that Asuka should certainly have forgotten, yet here they were. Some of them Shinji had even forgotten himself, so he was surprised to see them. He had forgotten how different things were before he had gotten his angel powers. If things could only have stayed the same...  
当真嗣冲向记忆来源的方向时，他发现所有这些记忆都与他有关，明日香当然应该忘记的，但它们却在这里。其中一些真嗣甚至忘记了自己，所以他看到他们感到很惊讶。他已经忘记了在获得天使力量之前事情有多么不同。如果事情能保持不变就好了……

Shinji finally reached where the memories had congregated, and ran towards them, careful to dodge them as he went, afraid of popping them. As he neared the center, he saw a shape on the floor, completely different than that of the memories. The fiery hair of Asuka stood out particularly bright in the expanse of whiteness.  
真嗣终于到达了记忆聚集的地方，向他们跑去，边走边小心地躲开它们，生怕撞到它们。当他接近中心的时候，他看到地板上有一个与记忆中完全不同的形状。明日香火红的头发在一片白色中显得格外耀眼。

"Asuka!" shouted Shinji. “飞鸟！”真嗣喊道。

Asuka gave no sign that she heard him, but her head did turn slightly to its left, looking towards him.  
明日香没有表现出听到他说话的迹象，但她的头确实稍微向左转，看向他。

Shinji threw himself to the ground beside her, grabbing her shoulders and pulling her towards himself, cradling her in his arms, giving no sign that he cared that she also was naked. Even now she was unusually cold. Her skin was pale white, and her lips had a light purple tinge to them. But it was her eyes that scared Shinji. They were hazy, as though not really seeing anything.  
真嗣倒在她身旁的地上，抓住她的肩膀，将她拉向自己，将她搂在怀里，丝毫没有表现出他在意她也赤身裸体。即使现在，她也异常冷漠。她的皮肤白皙，嘴唇带着浅紫色。但真正让真嗣害怕的是她的眼睛。他们目光朦胧，仿佛什么也没看见。

"Asuka...c'mon Asuka...wake up..."  
“明日香……来吧，明日香……醒醒……”

Shinji stared down at her face. Her eyes were fixated on him, but Shinji knew that she wasn't really seeing him.  
真嗣低头看着她的脸。她的眼睛盯着他，但真嗣知道她并不是真的在看他。

"C'mon...this is a joke...right? Asuka!"  
“得了吧……这是个玩笑……对吗？明日香！”

Shinji yelled her name again, pressing his body against hers, trying to convey the feeling of warmth. He buried his face in her hair, running his hand along her bare back, trying to bring her back.  
真嗣再次喊着她的名字，将自己的身体压在她的身上，试图传达温暖的感觉。他把脸埋进她的头发里，用手抚摸着她光秃秃的后背，试图把她拉回来。

"Something...anything...Asuka please." Shinji started crying, his tears falling upon her face.  
“有事……有事……明日香拜托了。”真嗣开始哭泣，泪水落在她的脸上。

He never even got to tell her-  
他甚至都没来得及告诉她——

...shin... ...胫...

Shinji opened his tear strained eyes and looked down at her  
真嗣睁开泪眼，低头看着她

...shin...ji... ……申……吉……

Asuka opened and closed her mouth, her voice barely more than a whisper.  
明日香张开嘴又闭上，她的声音几乎只是耳语。

"Asuka!" “飞鸟！”

"Shin...ji? “新……吉？

"Asuka are you-" “明日香你是——”

"Shinji...listen..." mumbled Asuka.  
“真嗣……听着……”明日香咕哝道。

"Asuka don't say anything else, I-"  
“明日香别再说什么了，我——”

"I remembered everything...everything painful, everything wonderful..."  
“我记得一切……一切痛苦的事情，一切美好的事情……”

Shinji was silent as he held her, looking down at her face. She was speaking in a very low voice, her eyes still clouded over.  
真嗣沉默地抱着她，低头看着她的脸。她说话的声音很低，眼神依然阴沉。

"And Shinji...there was a lot of pain involved, but I'm still glad that I chose to remember you..."  
“而真嗣……虽然经历了很多痛苦，但我仍然很高兴我选择记住你……”

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

Asuka smiled, and cupped Shinji's face with one of her hands. "Idiot...don't cry like that."  
明日香微笑着，用一只手捧起真嗣的脸。 “笨蛋……别哭了。”

"But...you..." started Shinji.  
“但是……你……”真嗣开口道。

But Asuka placed her index finger against his lips, silencing him.  
但明日香将食指放在他的嘴唇上，让他闭嘴。

"Don't say anything, because this is difficult for me," said Asuka with a low sigh. I've just remembered countless things, many of which I'd rather not remember. So don't say anything right now...I'm still not feeling very well...but having you here is..."  
“别说什么，因为这对我来说很难。”明日香低声叹了口气说道。我刚刚想起了无数的事情，其中​​很多我宁愿不记得。所以现在什么都别说……我还是感觉不太舒服……但是有你在这里是……”

Asuka turned her face, pressing it against Shinji's chest.  
明日香转过脸，将脸贴在真嗣的胸口上。

"...better," she mumbled quietly.  
“……好多了。”她低声咕哝道。

Shinji stared down at Asuka's face pressed against his chest. Her body was slightly warmer now, and her eyes seemed to be regaining their normal clear blue color.  
真嗣低头看着明日香贴在自己胸口的脸。她的身体现在稍微暖和了，她的眼睛似乎也恢复了正常的清澈蓝色。

"Hmmm...okay," said Shinji as he rested his chin upon her head.  
“嗯……好吧，”真嗣把下巴靠在她的头上说道。

They stayed like that for an unforetold amount of time, and Shinji had nodded off several times while watching Asuka. After a long while though, Shinji felt himself being roused awake by something soft. As he slowly opened his eyes, his vision was completely taken up by Asuka who was sitting in front of him and lightly tapping his cheek.  
他们就这样呆了很长一段时间，真嗣看着明日香，好几次打瞌睡。过了好一会儿，真嗣感觉自己被某种柔软的东西惊醒了。当他缓缓睁开眼睛时，他的视线完全被坐在他面前轻轻拍着他脸颊的明日香占据。

"Shinji? You awake?" “真嗣？你醒了？”

"...Yeah...sorry..." “……是啊……抱歉……”

"No...don't be. You came to get me. Any longer and I probably would have faded completely."  
“不……别这样。你是来抓我的。再拖下去我可能就彻底消失了。”

"What happened to you? What were you like that? I thought that you had-"  
“你怎么了？你当时是什么样子？我以为你——”

"I remembered...certain things. They affected me heavily, probably always will. I almost shut myself out, simply because it was easier to do that have to remember the pain. Without you there Shinji, I wasn't able to continue. Any later and I would have-"  
“我记得……某些事情。它们对我影响很大，可能永远都会。我几乎把自己拒之门外，只是因为记住痛苦更容易做到。没有你在，真嗣，我无法继续下去再晚一点，我就会——”

"Don't say that, I don't want to think about that," said Shinji as he shook his head.  
“别这么说，我不想考虑这个。”真嗣摇摇头说道。

"Thank you," said Asuka wearily.  
“谢谢你。”明日香疲倦地说。

"Are you okay?" asked Shinji.  
“你还好吗？”真嗣问道。

"Yes..and no," said Asuka. "Everything hurts, but I am at the same time happy that I could see you, which makes me have to ask, where are we exactly?"  
“是的……也不是，”明日香说。 “一切都很痛苦，但我同时很高兴能见到你，这让我不得不问，我们到底在哪里？”

"In the Black Egg of Lilith I suppose," said Shinji.  
“我想是在莉莉丝的黑蛋里。”真嗣说道。

"So then, this is Third Impact? Are we in the middle of Instrumentality?"  
“那么，这是第三次冲击吗？我们正处于工具性之中吗？”

"We were, but I talked to Lilith, and we reached an understanding. Its really thanks to Lilith and Rei that I was able to find you."  
“是的，但是我和莉莉丝谈过，我们达成了谅解。真的多亏了莉莉丝和丽，我才能够找到你们。”

Asuka was silent however, her face expressionless.  
然而明日香却沉默不语，面无表情。

"Are you angry at her, for killing you?" asked Shinji eventually.  
“你因为她杀了你而生她的气吗？”真嗣最终问道。

"I am, but I can still feel the pain of dying..."  
“是啊，但我还是能感受到死亡的痛苦……”

"Don't worry, it will pass," Shinji assured her.  
“别担心，一切都会过去的。”真嗣向她保证。

"...I...hope so," sighed Asuka.  
“……我……希望如此，”明日香叹息道。

Shinji looked down at her face, surprised at how worn it seemed. Even though Asuka was only fifteen, she seemed to have aged exponentially during her time in here.  
真嗣低头看着她的脸，惊讶地发现她的脸是如此憔悴。尽管明日香只有十五岁，但在这里的这段时间里，她似乎苍老了很多。

"How are you feeling?" Shinji asked her.  
“你感觉怎么样？”真嗣问她。

"Better I suppose, though still very tired. My mind is a whirl of things, and I'm having trouble keeping track of the different memories. Its like, a different me existed in the memories from before; I'm having trouble coming to terms with that. And yourself also...you were also very different."  
“我想好多了，虽然还是很累。我的脑子里乱七八糟，我很难记住不同的记忆。就像，记忆中存在着一个与以前不同的我；我很难恢复过来。”就这一点而言，你自己也很不同。”

"I know..." mumbled Shinji.  
“我知道……”真嗣咕哝道。

"Why did you do it Shinji? Why didn't you just tell me flat out that we had loved each other? Even at the end, you still lied to me about us, saying that we were only friends."  
“你为什么要这么做，真嗣？你为什么不直接告诉我我们彼此相爱？甚至到了最后，你仍然对我们撒谎，说我们只是朋友。”

Shinji had hoped that she wouldn't bring this up, but he didn't have any way of evading the question.  
真嗣本来希望她不要提起这件事，但他却没有办法回避这个问题。

"I told you before about my visions and how I was able to see possibilities of the future involved with the people around me. You were always at the forefront of my mind, and I tried denying that by rejecting what I felt. I sealed off my own emotions after you lost your memories, but that didn't work of course. I still remembered things, even if they were very vague. I knew what had happened once, and knew that it could happen again. I couldn't let anything happen to you however, and promised myself that I would do everything in my power to prevent you from entering an Evangelion again. But you proved too stubborn, and surprised me again and again."  
“我之前告诉过你我的愿景，以及我如何能够看到与周围的人有关的未来的可能性。你总是在我的脑海中，我试图通过拒绝我的感受来否认这一点。我封锁了你失去记忆后我自己的情绪，但这当然不起作用，即使它们非常模糊，我知道曾经发生过什么，并且知道它可能会再次发生。不管你发生什么事情，我都向自己保证，我会尽一切努力阻止你再次进入新世纪福音战士，但事实证明你太固执了，一次又一次让我感到惊讶。”

Asuka stared back at him, her face mere inches away from his. Looking down at his chest, she rest her head against it and spoke softly.  
明日香回望着他，她的脸距离他的脸只有几英寸。低头看着他的胸口，她把头靠在他的胸口上，轻声说道。

"The feeling had always been there as you said, but it always hurt...just seeing you hurt sometimes. And those earrings...that day confuses me, but I still understand what had happened, and yet, everything was snatched away afterwards."  
“就像你说的，这种感觉一直都在，但总是很痛……只是有时看到你受伤。还有那些耳环……那天让我很困惑，但我仍然明白发生了什么，然而，一切都被夺走了。”然后。”

"It was," Shinji nodded. “是的。”真嗣点点头。

Asuka was silent now, her face still pressed against Shinji's chest, not carrying that hers and his bodies were so entwined with each other.  
明日香现在沉默了，她的脸仍然贴在真嗣的胸口上，没有意识到她和他的身体如此纠缠在一起。

"What...will we do now?" asked Asuka.  
“我们……现在做什么？”明日香问道。

"Lilith promised me something," said Shinji after a few seconds. "I don't know what it is, but if it can get rid of your pain..."  
“莉莉丝答应了我一件事。”几秒钟后真嗣说道。 “我不知道那是什么，但如果它能解除你的痛苦的话……”

"That would be nice," sighed Asuka.  
“那就太好了，”明日香叹息道。

Shinji smiled slightly, and wrapped his arms around her back, running his hands along it, pausing at the groves and tracing a line. Asuka shivered slightly at his touch, but let him continue on as he pleased. She didn't care that they were both naked right now, she only cared about this feeling that was running through her right now. But she was afraid that if Shinji let go, the pain of her memories would overtake her again.  
真嗣微微一笑，用双臂搂住她的背，用手抚过她的背，在树林处停下来，画出一条线。明日香在他的触碰下微微颤抖，但还是让他继续说下去。她不在乎他们现在都赤身裸体，她只在乎此刻流淌在她身上的这种感觉。但她害怕，如果真嗣放手，记忆中的痛苦会再次降临到她身上。

"Hey Shinji..." “喂，慎二……”

"Hmmm?" “嗯？”

"Do you still love me?"  
“你还爱我吗？”

Her question caught him off guard, and he paused with the stroking of her back. Did he still love Asuka? He always told himself that he did, but sometimes he didn't rightfully understand what love was, or if this was how it was supposed to feel.  
她的问题让他措手不及，他停了下来，抚摸着她的背。他还爱明日香吗？他总是告诉自己他做到了，但有时他并没有正确理解爱是什么，或者这是否应该是这样的感觉。

"I do," said Shinji slowly. "Though I don't understand it myself..."  
“我愿意。”真嗣缓缓说道。 “虽然我自己也不太明白……”

Asuka looked up at Shinji, a frown on her face.  
明日香抬头看着真嗣，脸上皱起了眉头。

"Do you really have to understand it?" wondered Asuka.  
“你真的必须明白吗？”明日香想知道。

"Huh?" “嗯？”

Letting out a low sigh, Asuka's breath tickled Shinji's chest, making him squirm. Asuka smiled slightly at this and said, "Love isn't something easily understood in the first place, something which I've realized recently. But if being around somebody makes you happy, shouldn't that be enough?"  
明日香低低地叹了口气，呼吸喷在真嗣的胸口，让他浑身蠕动。明日香闻言微微一笑，说道：“爱情本来就不是一件容易理解的事情，我最近才意识到这一点。但如果有人在身边能让你快乐，那不就足够了吗？”

Shinji looked at Asuka's face, feelings and emotions running through him which he had forgotten. Asuka was...had always been, somebody important to him, somebody that could never be replaced. If this was love...then-  
真嗣看着明日香的脸，他已经忘记了他的感受和情绪。明日香是……一直都是，一个对他来说很重要的人，一个永远无法取代的人。如果这就是爱……那么——

Shinji wrapped his arms around Asuka's back, and pulled her towards him, resting his forehead against hers as he did so. Asuka smiled slightly as she closed her eyes, enjoying the feel of closeness that radiated from herself and Shinji.  
真嗣用双臂搂住明日香的背，将她拉向自己，同时将额头抵在她的额头上。明日香微微一笑，闭上眼睛，享受着自己和真嗣散发出的亲密感。

"Hey Shinji...would it be selfish of me to do something?" asked Asuka quietly.  
“嘿，真嗣……我这样做会不会很自私？”明日香轻声问道。

Shinji opened his eyes and looked at her. Her eyes were open as well as she stared back at him; they were incredibly clear.  
真嗣睁开眼睛，看着她。她的眼睛睁着，也盯着他。他们非常清楚。

Shinji shook his head softly.  
慎二轻轻摇了摇头。

"Okay," mumbled Asuka as she leaned into him, pressing her breasts against his chest as she kissed him. Though momentarily caught off guard, Shinji let his own emotions take hold, and kissed Asuka back, projecting his love of her through the kiss.  
“好吧，”明日香低声说道，她靠向他，将乳房贴在他的胸前，亲吻他。尽管一时措手不及，真嗣还是控制住了自己的情绪，回吻了明日香，通过这个吻表达了他对她的爱。

They broke apart shortly, and stared back at each other. It had been painful, but they had been able to overcome that pain.  
很快他们就分开了，互相对视着。这很痛苦，但他们能够克服这种痛苦。

"Hey Shinji," mumbled Asuka as she cupped his face in her hands.  
“嘿真嗣，”明日香用手捧着他的脸，咕哝道。

"Yeah..." nodded Shinji. “嗯……”慎二点头。

Asuka leaned forward, and kissed him again, her lips overlapping with his, her warmth meshing with his. Shinji placed his arms behind her bare back, running his hands along it. Asuka shivered at his touch again, but continued kissing him. She wanted this, even if they forgot it. She wanted to feel Shinji like this at least once. The future was uncertain, so she wanted to enjoy this moment without worry about what was to come.  
明日香倾身向前，再次吻了他，她的嘴唇与他的嘴唇重叠，她的温暖与他的交融。真嗣将双臂放在她赤裸的背后，抚摸着她的背。明日香因他的触碰再次颤抖，但仍继续亲吻他。她想要这个，即使他们忘记了。她想至少有一次真嗣这样的感觉。未来是不确定的，所以她想享受这一刻，而不用担心即将发生的事情。

Asuka broke the kiss off first, and looked away from Shinji. Her cheeks were slightly pink, but looking out of the corner of her eye, she saw that Shinji's as well were pink. She chuckled a little at that.  
明日香率先结束了这个吻，并把目光从真嗣身上移开。她的脸颊微微泛着粉红色，但她用眼角的余光看到真嗣的脸颊也是粉红色的。说到这里她轻笑了一声。

'We are only fifteen years old after all,' thought Asuka. Hopefully though, there would be many more moments like this to come.  
“我们毕竟才十五岁，”明日香想。但希望以后还会有更多这样的时刻。

"...Asuka...uhh..." stuttered Shinji  
“……明日香……呃……”真嗣结结巴巴地说

"Hmmm?" asked Asuka with a raised eyebrow, regaining some of her flare.  
“嗯？”明日香扬起眉毛问道，她的怒火又恢复了一些。

"Sorry...just surprised is all."  
“抱歉……只是惊讶而已。”

"I told you it was selfish," said Asuka as she stood up and threw her arms above her head, stretching her body. Now that they weren't so close, Shinji wasn't able to look at her. Partly because Asuka was still naked, but partly because he was still embarrassed over what had happened.  
“我告诉过你这是自私的，”明日香站起来，将双臂举过头顶，伸展身体。现在距离不再那么近，真嗣无法看她。部分是因为明日香仍然赤身裸体，但部分是因为他仍然对所发生的事情感到尴尬。

"Is this still inside the Black Egg though?" asked Asuka as she looked around.  
“这还在黑蛋里面吗？”明日香环顾四周问道。

"Yes...but this is inside your mind," said Shinji as she sat up, his eyes still looking at the ground.  
“是的……但这是在你的脑海里，”真嗣坐起身说道，他的眼睛仍然看着地面。

"How are you here exactly then?"  
“那你怎么在这里？”

"AT-field," said Shinji simply.  
“AT-field，”真嗣简单地说。

"Then how exactly are we supposed to get out?"  
“那我们到底该怎么出去呢？”

"That would be your doing I'm guessing," said Shinji.  
“我猜那是你干的，”真嗣说。

Asuka looked over at him, and frowned, annoyed that he wasn't looking at her. All right, yes this was highly embarrassing, and yes they were both naked, but hadn't they both basically said they still loved each other?  
明日香看着他，皱起眉头，因为他没有看她而生气。好吧，是的，这非常尴尬，是的，他们都赤身裸体，但他们不是基本上都说他们仍然爱着对方吗？

"Well...I'll try," said Asuka.  
“嗯……我会尽力的，”明日香说道。

Asuka closed her eyes then and searched for her body within the sea of LCL fluid. It was difficult at first, but Asuka knowing who she was, found her body relatively quickly. That and the fact it was sectioned off from everybody else.  
明日香闭上眼睛，在拼箱液的海洋中寻找着自己的身体。一开始很难，但明日香知道她是谁，很快就找到了她的身体。事实是它与其他人隔离开来。

"Did you find it?" asked Shinji. He felt the plane they were in suddenly lose some of its foundation.  
“你找到了吗？”真嗣问道。他感觉他们所在的位面突然失去了一些根基。

"Yeah, I did," said Asuka as she walked over to him and held a hand out. Shinji wordlessly took it, still trying not to look directly at her.  
“是的，我做到了，”明日香走到他身边并伸出一只手说道。真嗣一言不发地接过它，仍然试图不直视她。

"See above then," said Asuka with a small smile.  
“那就看上面吧。”明日香微笑着说道。

"Yeah..." mumbled Shinji.  
“是啊……”真嗣咕哝道。

The white walls around them shattered, and darkness engulfed the two of them. At first, Shinji was surprised by this, but saw Asuka unaffected by it, and assumed everything was okay.  
周围的白色墙壁破碎，黑暗吞没了两人。起初，真嗣对此感到惊讶，但看到明日香没有受到影响，并认为一切都很好。

Shinji opened his eyes within the sea of orange LCL fluid and looked quickly down at the girl next to him. After several seconds, Asuka opened her eyes slowly, blinking as she looked up at Shinji.  
真嗣在橙色的拼箱液体海洋中睁开了眼睛，迅速低头看着身旁的女孩。几秒钟后，明日香缓缓睁开眼睛，眨着眼睛抬头看着真嗣。

"Is this it?" asked Asuka as she sat up.  
“是这个吗？”明日香坐起来问道。

"It is..." said Shinji. “这是……”真嗣说道。

"I'm starting to wish I stayed in there."  
“我开始希望我能呆在那里。”

Shinji didn't appreciate the joke. Asuka however looked down at her body, and quickly covered it; she was still naked. Darting her gaze towards Shinji, she looked at him annoyingly, since he still had clothes on.  
真嗣不喜欢这个玩笑。明日香却低头看了看自己的身体，赶紧捂住了自己的身体。她仍然赤身裸体。她的目光投向真嗣，恼怒地看着他，因为他还穿着衣服。

"How come I'm naked and you're not?"  
“为什么我是裸体的，而你却不是？”

"Probably because I came from the outside," said Shinji. "And you seemed fine before."  
“可能是因为我是从外面来的吧。”真嗣说道。 “而且你之前看起来还不错。”

'Because you were naked also,' thought Asuka wordlessly.  
“因为你也赤身裸体。”明日香无言地想。

"Well...whatever. Lets get out of there. I want to see Lilith-"  
“好吧……无论如何。我们离开那里吧。我想见莉莉丝——”

Pain hit Asuka's heart as her memories caught up with her. Flashes of everything seared her mind so that she was forced to clutch her head in agony.  
当她的记忆追上她时，明日香的心感到疼痛。眼前的一切一幕幕闪过，让她的心灼痛不已，她不得不痛苦地抱住头。

"Asuka!" shouted Shinji. “飞鸟！”真嗣喊道。

Rushing to her side, he gripped her shoulders and held her against his chest. She was shaking uncontrollably.  
他冲到她身边，抓住她的肩膀，将她按在自己的胸前。她无法控制地颤抖着。

"Shinji...it hurts," Asuka groaned as tears started leaking from her eyes.  
“真嗣……好痛。”明日香呻吟着，泪水从她的眼中流淌出来。

'Damn it,' thought Shinji. Asuka's mind still wasn't able to cope with the new memories. Everything contradicted everything else so that she didn't know what was right anymore. And the rape...Shinji knew this is what tormented Asuka the most. Having to remember the feeling of it must have been too terrible.  
“该死，”真嗣想。明日香的大脑仍然无法应对新的记忆。一切都互相矛盾，让她不知道什么才是正确的。还有强奸……真嗣知道这才是最让明日香痛苦的事情。必须记住那种感觉一定太可怕了。

'But Lilith should be able to help,' Shinji told himself.  
“但是莉莉丝应该能够帮忙，”真嗣告诉自己。

"C'mon on Asuka. I'll guide you out."  
“来吧明日香。我带你出去。”

Asuka sniffed slightly and pressed her head against Shinji's chest, uncaring now that she was naked.  
明日香轻轻吸了吸鼻子，把头靠在真嗣的胸口上，毫不在意她赤身裸体。

Shinji continued moving forward through the stream of LCL fluid, carrying Asuka in his arms as he went, holding onto her dearly. Asuka was silent, but she was still shaking in Shinji's arms. Shinji didn't know what he was supposed to say to her, or how to even comfort her right now. He could try to alter her memories with his AT-field he supposed, but nothing good would likely come of that.  
真嗣继续在拼箱液流中前进，边走边抱着明日香，紧紧地抱住她。明日香沉默了，但她在真嗣的怀里仍然颤抖着。真嗣现在不知道自己该对她说什么，甚至不知道该如何安慰她。他认为他可以尝试用他的 AT 场改变她的记忆，但这样做不太可能有什么好处。

No, it was only Lilith that he could rely on right now.  
不，现在他能依靠的只有莉莉丝。

---

After what felt like hours, Shinji finally broke free of the Black Egg. The last stretch had surprised him however, as nobody tried to impede them. He suspected that Lilith might have had something to do with this.  
过了好几个小时，真嗣终于挣脱了黑蛋。然而最后一段让他感到惊讶，因为没有人试图阻止他们。他怀疑这件事可能与莉莉丝有关。

His body was of course still resting inside Unit 01, providing the equation to Third Impact, so this was where he was transported to after he broke free of the Egg. He felt his mind slowly float down into his body, but only one thing was missing.  
当然，他的身体仍在01号单元内，为第三次冲击提供了方程式，所以这就是他挣脱蛋后被传送到的地方。他感觉自己的神识慢慢飘落到体内，却唯独少了一样东西。

"Asuka?" asked Shinji. “明日香？”真嗣问道。

She had returned there with him. But he had been sure that she had been with him when he-  
她和他一起回到了那里。但他确信她一直在他身边，当他——

"I have her here with me Shinji," came Lilith's voice from around him.  
“我让她和我在一起，真嗣，”莉莉丝的声音从他身边传来。

"Lilith, if you do anything to harm Asuka, I swear."  
“莉莉丝，如果你做了任何伤害明日香的事，我发誓。”

"Relax, I wont harm her in any way. I just want to talk with you for now, about what happens now. I've put her mind at rest momentarily so she doesn't have to deal with the pain however."  
“放心，我不会以任何方式伤害她。我现在只想和你谈谈，谈谈现在发生的事情。我已经让她暂时安息了，这样她就不用承受痛苦了。”

"Fine, I'm coming over," said Shinji.  
“好吧，我这就过去。”真嗣说道。

Leaving his mind, he traveled to the Garden of Eden, and felt his feet slam down on the white soil there. He was standing in front of the Tree of Life. He stared at it for several seconds, looking at its withered state before he turned towards the two people beside it. Asuka was laying on the ground, breathing deeply as she rested. Shinji almost wished that things could stay like that forever, that Asuka wouldn't have to feel anymore pain. But such a thing was impossible.  
他抛开思绪，来到了伊甸园，感觉自己的脚踩在了那里的白色泥土上。他站在生命之树前。他盯着它看了几秒，看着它枯萎的样子，这才转向旁边的两人。明日香躺在地上，深呼吸着休息。真嗣几乎希望事情能永远这样下去，明日香再也不用感到痛苦了。但这样的事是不可能的。

Turning towards the person beside her, he looked at Lilith for a few seconds. She was looking down at Asuka with a curious expression on her face, something which reminded Shinji of Rei momentarily.  
他转头看向身边的人，看了莉莉丝几秒。她低头看着明日香，脸上带着好奇的表情，这让真嗣瞬间想起了丽。

"You found her," said Lilith simply.  
“你找到了她，”莉莉丝简单地说。

"There was never a moment when I didn't think I would," said Shinji.  
“我从来没有想过我会这么做，”真嗣说。

Lilith turned towards him and said, "But you were also a bit late. She remember things that her already weakened mind was not able to take, and without you there, she faded away. Though she is sleeping peacefully now, if she were to wake up, that pain would still be there."  
莉莉丝转头看向他，道：“不过你也来晚了一些，她已经记不清了，她本就虚弱的心智无法承受，没有你在，她就渐渐消失了。虽然她现在睡得很安稳，但如果她醒醒吧，疼痛依然存在。”

"But you said there was something you could do."  
“但你说过你可以做点什么。”

"I did, but I must first ask you Shinji about the circumstances of which you will be thrown in. I told you already that the world will be as it is for several years until the planet starts to regrow. If humans leave things untouched for a time, it will speed up the process. Not every human will return of course, some desiring the false reality, and they can become enamored in it for all I care. That is there decision. But humans will return nonetheless."  
“是的，但我必须先问你，真嗣，你将被扔进什么样的环境。我已经告诉过你，世界将在数年之内保持原样，直到地球开始重新生长。如果人类不去碰触一切，当然，并不是每个人都会回归，有些人渴望虚假的现实，他们可能会迷恋它，但这就是我所关心的决定，但人类仍然会回归。”

"As for you and Asuka...it seems impossible to separate you. Whether you have your memories in tact or not, you two still sot each other out. I don't believe it is a thing that can be prevented, but I can alleviate your pain to some degree, as I am partially to blame because of that pain."  
“至于你和明日香……似乎不可能分开。无论你们的记忆是否完整，你们两个人还是在互相较量。我不认为这是可以阻止的事情，但我可以在某种程度上减轻你的痛苦，因为我对这种痛苦负有部分责任。”

"Shinji, as you know, Adam created the bodies of you humans, and I created your AT-field, everything that incorporates a person. There personality, thoughts, and memories, they all make up who a person is. The angels each had a power, and Adam and myself being the forerunners had powers of creation. I created things more abstract, while Adam created things more physical. The AT-fields are an example of this. They are impossible to see or feel by normal humans, but they exist nonetheless."  
“真嗣，如你所知，亚当创造了你们人类的身体，而我创造了你们的 AT 场，以及包含一个人的一切。有个性、思想和记忆，它们都构成了一个人。每个天使都有亚当和我自己是先驱者，我创造了更抽象的事物，而亚当创造了更物理的事物，AT 场就是一个例子，它们是普通人无法看到或感觉到的。尽管如此，它们仍然存在。”

"Shinji...though you and Asuka love each other, you both unknowingly hurt each other and were hurt by the things around you, and this is no more apparent then with what Asuka is dealing with right now. If she had never met you, would she ever have experience those things? The same for you; if you had never met Asuka, would you ever have discovered your angel powers and the fact that you are Adam's son? All these things hurt you however, even if they are the truth, for the truth usually hurts."  
“真嗣……虽然你和明日香彼此相爱，但你们都在不知不觉中互相伤害，并被周围的事物所伤害，而这一点在明日香现在所面对的情况下就更不明显了。如果她从未见过你的话，她会经历这些事情吗？如果你从未见过明日香，你会发现你的天使力量和你是亚当的儿子这一事实，即使它们是亚当的儿子？真相，因为真相通常会带来伤害。”

"I'm sorry for everything that I've done, and as I said, I am partially to blame. I showed you how to control your powers, I nudged you along the way, hoping that things would fall into place as they did. But still, you rejected me, you rejected Instrumentality, you rejected the false reality, all for the girl that you love, even though you were uncertain about that love. That girl replied in turn, loving you as you loved her. But the pain of everything will still exist, even with that love there."  
“我对我所做的一切感到抱歉，正如我所说，我也有部分责任。我向你展示了如何控制你的力量，我一路上推动着你，希望事情能像他们所做的那样顺利进行。但你仍然拒绝了我，你拒绝了工具性，你拒绝了虚假的现实，这一切都是为了你所爱的女孩，尽管你不确定那个女孩反过来爱你，就像你爱她一样。即使有那样的爱，一切的痛苦仍然存在。”

"I've decided that I'll help you and Asuka in this regard however, and erase all your memories of each other."  
“不过，我决定在这方面帮助你们和明日香，并抹去你们关于彼此的所有记忆。”

Shinji was silent, thinking that he had heard wrong. Erase there memories of each other? Something like that was...but he cherished those memories he had of Asuka. He didn't want to lose them!  
真嗣沉默了，以为自己听错了。抹去彼此的记忆？类似的事情是……但他很珍惜与明日香有关的那些回忆。他不想失去他们！

"Lilith...that is-" 「莉莉丝……那是——」

"Something which you can't agree with?" asked Lilith.  
“有什么事情你不能同意吗？”莉莉丝问道。

"Of course! I just got Asuka back, and now you say that we should just forget about each other completely? Bullshit!"  
“当然！我刚把明日香带回来，你却说我们应该彻底忘记对方？胡扯！”

"Shinji, think about it this way. Those memories will forever be ingrained in your mind. You are strong, and that is largely thanks to your angel prowess, but Asuka is still human, and having memories from two completely separate moments in her life will torment her until she wont know which one is truly her."  
“真嗣，这样想吧。那些记忆将永远在你的脑海中根深蒂固。你很坚强，这很大程度上要归功于你的天使力量，但明日香仍然是人类，她拥有生命中两个完全不同时刻的记忆会折磨她，直到她分不清哪个才是真正的她。”

"But-" “但-”

"This is all I can do Shinji. It is the only way to take care of Asuka's pain. And you yourself are in pain, even if you don't want to admit it. You locked many things away inside you, but if those were to spill forth suddenly, your rage and anger may break people dear to you. Do you want that?"  
“这就是真嗣所能做的一切。这是解决明日香痛苦的唯一方法。而你自己也很痛苦，即使你不想承认。你把很多东西锁在心里，但如果那些东西如果突然爆发，你的愤怒和愤怒可能会伤害你所爱的人，你愿意吗？”

"No, but-" “不是，但-”

Lilith shook her head and looked down at Asuka.  
莉莉丝摇摇头，低头看着明日香。

"I spoke to her briefly before you arrived here, and told her about my offer. She, like you was hesitant, but I think she believed as I do that even if your memories of each other no longer exist, the love for each other will still remain. Memories may disappear and fade, but the body remembers a person important to it. You and Asuka connected on a level few humans are able to, and even though you are both at such a young age, you were both able to recognize each for who they were. Many humans, and even couples are unable to do this, and don't understand what the other is really thinking. But you and Asuka aren't like that."  
“在你到达这里之前，我和她简短地交谈过，告诉她我的提议。她和你一样犹豫不决，但我想她和我一样相信，即使你们彼此的记忆不再存在，对彼此的爱仍然存在。”记忆可能会消失和褪色，但身体会记住一个对它来说很重要的人，而你和明日香的联系程度是人类无法企及的，尽管你们都那么年轻，但你们都能够做到。许多人类，甚至情侣都做不到这一点，也不明白对方的真实想法，但你和明日香不是这样的。”

"So then...she agreed to it?"  
“那么……她就同意了？”

"Only if you do," replied Lilith. "Ultimately, it has to be both your decisions."  
“只要你愿意，”莉莉丝回答道。 “最终，这必须是你们两个的决定。”

Shinji's eyes moved towards Asuka momentarily gazing at her longingly.  
真嗣的目光移向明日香，一时充满渴望地注视着她。

"Lilith...if I agree to this...what about the other humans. What will happen to them?"  
“莉莉丝……如果我同意了……其他人类呢？他们会怎么样？”

Lilith paused for a brief second and thought about this.  
莉莉丝停顿了一下，思考了这个问题。

"For a time, I shall keep them within the Black Egg until I deem the time ready for the Lilim's rebirth. During that time, you and Asuka will be able to live alone, free from any turmoil. I can give you several years to grow with each other."  
“我会把他们暂时留在黑蛋里，直到我认为莉莉姆重生的时机已经成熟。在那段时间里，你和明日香将能够单独生活，不受任何动乱。我可以给你几年的时间。互相成长。”

"And what of my angel powers? Can you do anything about those?"  
“那我的天使力量呢？你能做点什么吗？”

Lilith's face fell slightly, as she remembered the conversation she had had with Rei.  
想起和雷的对话，莉莉丝的脸色微微沉了下来。

"Unfortunately Shinji, I can't do anything about that, nor could Adam even. You born from Adam and human, and were given the powers of an angel. I don't have any say in the matter. You are you are and will forever be. Even if you memories are gone, that part of you still remains."  
“不幸的是，真嗣，我对此无能为力，甚至亚当也无能为力。你是亚当和人类所生，并被赋予了天使的力量。我在这件事上没有任何发言权。你是你是，即使你的记忆消失了，那部分的你仍然存在。”

"...I see," said Shinji. “……我明白了，”真嗣说道。

Lilith watched Shinji, wondering if she should voice her opinion on the subject, but her and Rei had already talked about that. It wasn't there place to interfere.  
莉莉丝看着真嗣，想知道她是否应该就这个话题发表自己的看法，但她和丽已经谈过了。没有地方可以干涉。

"Then you agree to this?" asked Lilith.  
“那你同意这个吗？”莉莉丝问道。

Shinji once again looked over Asuka; he nodded his head slowly.  
真嗣再次看向明日香。他缓缓地点点头。

"Okay," said Lilith. “好吧，”莉莉丝说。

Standing up, she walked over to Shinji and placed a hand of hers on his head.  
她站起来，走到真嗣身边，将一只手放在他的头上。

"One last thing Lilith...what will you do after this? What will you and Ayanami do?"  
「莉莉丝最后一件事……之后你会做什么？你和绫波会做什么？」

"...I thought about your words, and have decided to search for Adam. He's out there somewhere, and seeing you and Asuka reminded me of times I'd all but forgotten. I'll hold onto the hope that we can become one again. But for the time being, I'll watch over the earth until the Lilim return. Afterwards...well, I'll worry about that when the time comes."  
“......我考虑了你的话，并决定寻找亚当。他就在外面的某个地方，看到你和明日香让我想起了我几乎忘记的那些时光。我会坚持希望我们能够成为但暂时，我会守护地球直到莉莉姆回来……好吧，到时候我会担心的。”

Lilith smiled slightly at Shinji, who couldn't help but smile back.  
莉莉丝对真嗣微微一笑，真嗣也忍不住笑了笑。

"Its been enjoyable seeing you grow into the person you are today," said Lilith. "I wish you and Asuka all the best."  
“看到你成长为今天的样子，我很高兴，”莉莉丝说。 “祝你和明日香一切顺利。”

Lilith then lightly tapped Shinji on the forehead, and whiteness immediately engulfed his mind.  
莉莉丝轻轻拍了拍真嗣的额头，真嗣的脑海立刻一片惨白。

---

At first, Shinji thought that he was inside Asuka's mind again, but as he noticed, things were slightly different. Though everything was white, there was a distinct outline of a wooden bench in the middle of the plane.  
起初，真嗣以为自己又进入了明日香的脑海，但当他注意到时，情况略有不同。虽然一切都是白色的，但飞机的正中央却有着清晰的木凳轮廓。

As Shinji started walking towards it, he felt a light tap on the back of his shoulder and jumped immensely. Spinning around, he saw Asuka standing there, a wide grin on her face. She was wearing her plug suit, and looking down at himself, Shinji noticed that he was wearing his as well.  
当真嗣开始朝它走去时，他感到肩膀后面被轻轻拍了一下，然后跳了起来。转过身来，他看到明日香站在那里，脸上挂着灿烂的笑容。她穿着她的紧身衣，低头看着自己，真嗣发现他也穿着他的。

"Jump easily, don't you?" laughed Asuka as she teased him.  
“跳起来很轻松，不是吗？”明日香嘲笑他时笑道。

"What was that for?" “那是干什么用的？”

"Just felt like it," said Asuka as she walked past him. Sitting down on the bench, she patted the spot beside her, indicating that she wanted him to sit next to her. Shinji did so, glancing sideways at her as she did so. Asuka threw her hands behind the bench and stretched her feet out.  
“只是感觉就像这样，”明日香从他身边走过时说道。坐在长凳上，她拍了拍身边的位置，示意他坐到自己身边。真嗣这样做了，同时侧眼看了她一眼。明日香把手放到长凳后面，伸出双脚。

"Ah, it feels good to be wearing a plug suit again."  
“啊，又穿上插头套装了，感觉真好。”

"Says you," mumbled Shinji.  
“你说。”真嗣咕哝道。

"You never did enjoy using the Evangelions."  
“你从来都不喜欢使用新世纪福音战士。”

"And you did?" “你做到了？”

"Well, it was always someplace I could go...and Mama was there of course," said Asuka. "Though of course, meeting you messed that up completely."  
“嗯，总有一个我可以去的地方……当然，妈妈也在那儿，”明日香说。 “当然，遇见你让事情完全搞砸了。”

"Do you regret that?" “你后悔吗？”

"Not at all," said Asuka as she turned and looked at Shinji. "Meeting you was the best thing that has ever happened to me."  
“一点也不。”明日香转身看着真嗣说道。 “遇见你是我这辈子发生过的最好的事情。”

Shinji stared back at her, amazed that she had said such words.  
真嗣回头看着她，很惊讶她会说出这样的话。

"I mean, who else is always going to cook my meals," laughed Asuka.  
“我的意思是，还有谁会一直给我做饭呢？”明日香笑着说。

Shinji sighed; he should have known better than to expected anything else.  
真嗣叹了口气；他应该比预期更清楚地知道其他事情。

But all too suddenly, Asuka's head tilted sideways onto Shinji's shoulder.  
但突然间，明日香的头侧向真嗣的肩膀。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

"...Will you hold me Shinji?" Asuka whispered through half closed lips.  
「……你能抱抱我吗？」明日香半闭着嘴唇低声说道。

Shinji did so, wrapping an arm around Asuka's shoulder and pulling her close to himself. He then rest his chin on the top of her head and nuzzled it against her silky hair.  
真嗣这样做了，用一只手臂搂住明日香的肩膀，将她拉近自己。然后他将下巴抵在她的头顶上，用鼻子蹭着她柔滑的头发。

"Shinji...I'm scared about the future. Did we make the right decision?"  
“真嗣……我对未来感到害怕。我们做出了正确的决定吗？”

Shinji looked down at Asuka, and saw her eyes wide with fear. He didn't want such an emotion to ever pass through her once again. So-  
真嗣低头看着明日香，看到她的眼睛里充满了恐惧。他不想让这样的情绪再次在她身上流过。所以-

"The pain will be gone," said Shinji as he brushed his lips against her hair.  
“疼痛会消失的，”真嗣一边说，一边用嘴唇拂过她的头发。

"But will we be...will we be able to love each other again?"  
“但是我们……我们还能再次相爱吗？”

Shinji drew his head away from her. Resting his hand on her chin, he tilted her chin upwards so that she was looking at him.  
真嗣把头从她身上移开。他把手放在她的下巴上，抬起她的下巴，让她看着他。

"For us, such a thing is always possible."  
“对我们来说，这样的事情总是有可能的。”

Shinji then leaned down and kissed Asuka sweetly. Even if he forgot, it didn't matter. He wanted this to be the last thing they remembered together.  
真嗣俯下身子，甜蜜地吻住了明日香。就算他忘记了，也没关系。他希望这是他们一起记得的最后一件事。

As Shinji and Asuka broke apart, a bright light from somewhere in the far distance shot outward. Shinji noticed the space they were in start to disappear, almost like when he had left Asuka's mind. But it was fading away, almost like a millions feathers floating in the wind.  
当真嗣和明日香分开时，一道明亮的光芒从远处的某处射出。真嗣注意到他们所在的空间开始消失，就像他离开明日香的脑海一样。但它正在消失，几乎就像数百万根羽毛在风中飘扬。

Shinji wrapped his arms around Asuka then, hugging her tightly. If things were gonna disappear like this, he wanted them to be-  
真嗣伸手搂住明日香，紧紧地拥抱着她。如果事情就这样消失，他希望它们——

"Huh?" “嗯？”

Shinji sat alone on the bench, his arms wrapped around empty space.  
真嗣独自坐在长凳上，双臂环抱着空地。

'What was I?' he wondered.  
“我是什么？”他想知道。

Then the whiteness engulfed him as it had engulfed Asuka.  
然后白色吞没了他，就像吞没了明日香一样。

---

Lilith sat alone under the Tree of Life. Both Shinji and Asuka lay side by side in an almost comatose like state.  
莉莉丝独自坐在生命之树下。真嗣和明日香并肩躺着，几乎处于昏迷状态。

'Well, things can now progress as they wish,' thought Lilith as she let out a low sigh. Placing a hand over both Shinji's and Asuka's body, she moved them from the Garden of Eden, to the ruins of Tokyo-3 below.  
“好吧，现在事情可以如他们所愿地发展了。”莉莉丝低声叹了一口气。她将一只手放在真嗣和明日香的身上，将他们从伊甸园移至下方的第三东京废墟。

'Now comes the difficult part,' sighed Lilith. Without Shinji's body, Third Impact would crumble away. Even though the Black Egg would remain in tact, she now had to focus all her power into putting humanity to sleep.  
“现在困难的部分来了，”莉莉丝叹了口气。没有真嗣的身体，第三次冲击就会崩溃。尽管黑蛋完好无损，但她现在必须集中所有力量让人类陷入沉睡。

'I suppose I've got my work cut out for me,' thought Lilith. Turning back to the Tree of Life, she stared at it one final time. But she noticed something then.  
“我想我的工作已经完成了，”莉莉丝想。她转回生命之树，最后一次凝视它。但随后她注意到了一些事情。

"Hmph, Adam and Eve huh?"  
“哼，亚当和夏娃啊？”

Two sprouts had appeared on the Tree of Life's withered branches.  
生命之树枯萎的枝条上，已经长出了两根新芽。

'Well, its in there hands now,' thought Lilith.  
“好吧，现在它就在那儿了，”莉莉丝想。

Afterwards, she disappeared from that place, never again to return in any shape or form.  
之后，她就从那个地方消失了，再也没有以任何形式出现过。
