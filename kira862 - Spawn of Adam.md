### Chapter 1: The Demon From Hell  
第一章：来自地狱的恶魔  

Disclaimer: I don't own Neon Genesis Evangelion, any of the characters, or any of the stuff relating to the franchise.  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》，也不拥有其中的任何角色或与该系列相关的任何内容。

Rated M for: Strong Language, Violence, blood and gore (in later chapter), and adult themes.  
分级为 M，原因包括：强烈的语言、暴力、血腥和恐怖（在后续章节中），以及成人主题。

**Well I finally got around to posting my story of Evangelion. So here is the first chapter. One of the things that made NGE so interesting was the relationships between the characters. Though it was also because of the psychological aspects which made in interesting to me. I try to stick close to the core of what made it interesting by having the characters question themselves in their own minds and of course developing the love-hate relationship of Shinji and Asuka. And without further ado I give you Spawn of Adam.  
好吧，我终于抽出时间来发布我的《福音战士》故事了。以下是第一章。《新世纪福音战士》之所以引人入胜，其中一个原因在于角色之间的关系。当然，心理层面的描绘也让我觉得它非常有趣。我试图紧扣使其有趣的本质，让角色们在内心深处自我质疑，并自然地发展出真嗣和明日香之间爱恨交织的关系。废话不多说，现在就为您呈现《亚当的子嗣》。**

**Update: 12/26/14.  更新日期：12/26/14。**

**So I've long known that Spawn of Adam has its fair share of problems, from its many grammatical errors, to the early interactions between Shinji and Asuka being somewhat out of place compared to how things started to take shape. With that said, I'm gonna begin re-uploading each chapter, fixing mistakes, and overall rewriting some stuff. In this chapter in particular I've completely changed the first interaction between them so that Asuka's been toned way down compared to how she initially acted.  
我早就知道《亚当的子嗣》存在不少问题，从诸多语法错误，到真嗣和明日香早期的互动与后来逐渐成形的情节相比显得有些突兀。话虽如此，我打算开始重新上传每一章，修正错误，并整体上重写一些内容。特别是这一章，我彻底改变了他们第一次互动的情节，让明日香的行为比最初的表现要收敛得多。**

Shinji Ikari looked out the window from where he sat in his homeroom class. It had been raining for close to a week now, and the rain depicted what his mood felt like right now: miserable. Shinji had never cared much for a social life and shunned people away when they got to close to him. He preferred to sit in class and listen to his SDAT while the teacher ran through the normal, boring routine of lecturing without pause. His teacher had gotten tired of having to put up with Shinji's constant absences, and him not paying attention in class and just acted like his seat was empty. Shinji didn't care anymore whether he wanted him there or not. He just came to school and slept whenever his roommate at home became too much of a pain in the ass to deal with.  
碇真嗣坐在教室里，目光投向窗外。雨已经下了将近一周，这雨正如他此刻的心情：凄凉。真嗣向来不热衷于社交生活，每当有人试图靠近，他便避之不及。他更愿意坐在教室里，听着 SDAT，任由老师无休止地进行那枯燥乏味的讲课。他的老师早已厌倦了真嗣频繁的缺席和课堂上心不在焉的态度，仿佛他的座位空无一人。真嗣已不再在乎老师是否希望他留在那里。他来学校只是为了逃避，每当家里的室友变得难以忍受时，他就在课堂上打盹。

Shinji sighed and continued to look out the window. He had received an envelope this morning from his father stating that he would be moving the next day. That was one reason why Shinji never had a social life. His father who worked at the Nerv facilities somewhere in Tokyo-3, constantly kept his son moving from apartment to apartment not letting him stay in the same place very long. Shinji hated his father for this, and the fact that he hadn't even seen him for over a year. His father had abandoned him to go work on his stupid Nerv projects, 'Whatever those were,' thought Shinji.  
真嗣叹了口气，继续望向窗外。今早他收到了父亲的一封信，说明天就要搬家了。这也是真嗣从未有过社交生活的原因之一。在东京-3 某处 NERV 设施工作的父亲，不断让儿子从一个公寓搬到另一个公寓，不让他长时间待在同一个地方。真嗣为此憎恨父亲，更因为已经超过一年没见过他了。父亲为了那些愚蠢的 NERV 项目抛弃了他，“管它是什么呢，”真嗣心想。

He continued to look out the window when he heard the bell ring, signaling the start of lunch. 'God damn this day,' he thought. 'I wish it would just hurry up and be over with so I can go to my next home. I can just hope that it'll be better than what I'm stuck with now.'  
他继续望着窗外，这时铃声响起，标志着午餐时间的开始。“该死的今天，”他心想，“真希望它能快点结束，这样我就可以去下一个家了。我只希望它比我现在被困的地方要好。”

He was the last one to get up from his chair and walked swiftly past the teacher as he shot Shinji a scowl. 'Don't even think he bothered to write my name down on the register. Though it doesn't matter now. I'm leaving so I won't be seeing him any more.'  
他是最后一个从椅子上站起来的人，迅速走过老师身边，老师对真嗣投以怒视。“他甚至可能都没在名册上写下我的名字。不过现在无所谓了。我要离开了，不会再见到他了。”

---

Leaving the school grounds, he suddenly wished he would have just stayed put. Within minutes of exiting the school, he was soaked to the bone and his clothes felt like they were weighing him down a few extra pounds.  
离开学校后，他突然希望自己刚才没有动。刚走出校门几分钟，他就被淋得浑身湿透，衣服感觉像是重了几磅，压得他喘不过气来。

Shinji however didn't want to go home, or what he called a home right now. Later, he would get back, pack up, and simply wait for tomorrow to come. He didn't feel like facing his roommate right now. This morning they had gotten into a shouting match over last nights party that had been held. Shinji had come back from strolling the streets of Tokyo-3 to find his room a mess, empty bear bottles littering the floor, and the smell of vomit lingering. Worst of all, he was stuck disinfecting the whole place, and now just this morning he found out he was leaving.  
然而，真嗣并不想回家，或者说他现在称之为家的地方。晚些时候，他会回去收拾行李，然后简单地等待明天的到来。他现在不想面对他的室友。今早他们因为昨晚的派对吵了起来。真嗣从东京-3 的街头漫步回来，发现房间一片狼藉，满地都是空啤酒瓶，呕吐物的气味挥之不去。最糟糕的是，他不得不负责整个地方的消毒工作，而现在就在今早，他得知自己要离开了。

'Should have left the idiot to clean the mess up himself,' he thought bitterly.  
“早知道就让那傻瓜自己收拾烂摊子了。”他苦涩地想。

Most of his time spent in Tokyo-3, he had taken long walks through the streets and alleyways and he knew the place so well that he could close his eyes and walk by memory. It was one way that he used to escape the reality that he was facing. With his SDAT in hand, he would walk aimlessly through Tokyo until he found a suitable spot to fall asleep. He almost wished that his father would just let him sleep outside. At least he was more content this way.  
在东京-3 度过的多数时光里，他常常漫步于街道和巷弄之间，对这片地方了如指掌，甚至闭上眼睛也能凭记忆行走。这是他逃避现实的一种方式。手持 SDAT，他会漫无目的地穿梭于东京，直到找到一个合适的角落入睡。他几乎希望父亲能让他睡在外面，至少这样他更感满足。

He walked aimlessly for hours until he arrive at a spot that he visited often. He had arrived at the Bay of Tokyo and looked towards the sun which was just starting to set. It was stuff like this that brought him into his own world. Watching the sun, he could forget about everything and just watch until it set. Then, though he would be forced back to the sharp reality that was his life and plunged into his own misery again. 'Its not like its my fault that I'm miserable. All my father ever does is shun me from place to place.'  
他漫无目的地走了几个小时，直到来到一个常去的地方。他来到了东京湾，望着太阳刚刚开始西沉。正是这样的景象让他沉浸在自己的世界里。凝视着夕阳，他可以忘却一切，只是静静地看着它落下。然而，每当太阳沉没，他又会被迫回到那尖锐的现实生活，再次陷入自己的痛苦之中。'我这么痛苦又不是我的错。父亲总是把我从一个地方赶到另一个地方。'

'Ah, but its your decision not to connect with people,' said a small voice in his head.  
'啊，但与人建立联系是你自己的选择，'他脑海中有个细小的声音说道。

'I never get a chance though. I rarely stay at the same school for three months. How the hell am I supposed to connect with people and then stay in contact with them if I move around so much?'  
“但我从未有机会。我很少在一所学校待满三个月。如果我总是四处搬家，我怎么可能与人建立联系并保持联系呢？”

The voice didn't respond as though admitting defeat.  
那个声音没有回应，仿佛承认了失败。

Shinji now laid back against the grassy shore and looked up into the sky, or what he could see of it. Many building towered over him and their tall peaks made it difficult for him to see much of the sky. He felt like they were pressing down around him. 'Damn this city,' he thought. 'There is nothing to do except get drunk, according to my roommate.' Even Shinji had to smile at that thought. 'Probably bending over the toilet right now and feeling his dinner coming up.'  
真嗣现在背靠在草地上，抬头望向天空，或者说他能看到的那部分天空。许多建筑物高耸在他周围，它们的尖顶使得他很难看到更多的天空。他感觉它们像是在他周围压迫下来。‘该死的这座城市，’他想，‘除了喝醉，我的室友说这里什么都没有。’就连真嗣想到这一点也不禁微笑。‘现在大概正弯着腰对着马桶，感受着晚餐涌上来吧。’

Shinji would have liked to continue laying their until the sun finally set but willed himself to get up. Even though he hated his roommate he thought it appropriate to tell him that he would be leaving tomorrow. Pushing himself up into a sitting position he gave one final look at the sun before he turned to go, but then did a double take.  
真嗣本想继续躺着直到太阳最终落下，但还是强迫自己起身。尽管他讨厌室友，他觉得还是应该告诉他明天自己要离开。他用力坐起身，在转身离开前最后看了一眼夕阳，却突然愣住了。

He wasn't sure how long they had been there, but someone was down by the water looking out across the ocean. Shinji squinted his eyes trying to make out who could be down there. Standing up he looked again and saw that it was a girl and she must have been close to his age. She had long red hair that came down to the middle of her back, and her hair was separating into three parts thanks to the hair clips that she wore. She was wearing a simple yellow dress that was blowing against the wind. The contrast between herself and the setting sun in front of her was almost blinding. It was almost as though that fiery red hair and sun dress magnified herself and the sun so that she gave off an eerie orange glow. Shinji wasn't sure what made him do it but he stood there for sometime watching the back of her. He had a sudden urge to go down there and find out who she was, but then shook his head.  
他不确定他们在那里待了多久，但有人在水边眺望着大海。真嗣眯起眼睛试图辨认出那会是谁。他站起来再次望去，发现那是个女孩，年龄应该和他相仿。她有着一头长长的红发，垂至背部中间，发丝因佩戴的发夹而分成三股。她穿着一件简单的黄色连衣裙，随风飘扬。她与前方夕阳的对比几乎令人目眩。仿佛那火红的头发和太阳裙将她与太阳放大，散发出一种诡异的橙色光芒。真嗣不确定是什么驱使他这样做，但他站在那里凝视着她的背影。他突然有种冲动想走下去，弄清楚她是谁，但随即摇了摇头。

"No point," he said softly. "Tomorrow I'll be gone again so theres no point in finding out who she is."  
“没意义，”他轻声说，“明天我又将离开，所以没必要知道她是谁。”

Giving her back one last look he turned and walked back towards his soon to be old apartment. Though the thought of the setting sun and her was constantly on his mind for the rest of the night.  
最后看了一眼她的背影，他转身走回即将成为旧公寓的地方。尽管夕阳和她一直萦绕在他的脑海中，直到深夜。

---

Shinji woke up the next morning and waited outside his roommates door. When he had come home last night he had found him sleeping on the couch passed out. Deciding that he would just wait till the next morning, he had packed what little things he owned, and went to sleep.  
第二天早上，真嗣醒来后便站在室友的房门外等候。昨晚回家时，他发现室友醉倒在沙发上睡着了。决定等到第二天早上再说，他收拾了自己仅有的几样东西，便去睡了。

Now he was leaning against his roommates door with his bag in his hand waiting for him to get up. Shinji sighed and looked down at his watch. He was supposed to meet this Misato Katsuragi in the next few hours. Shinji frowned at the name of this unidentified person. From the sound of it she was a women, and Shinji hadn't had a woman as a roommate, yet.  
现在，他倚靠在室友的房门上，手里提着包，等待对方起床。真嗣叹了口气，低头看了看手表。他应该在接下来的几个小时内与这位葛城美里见面。真嗣对这个未曾谋面的人的名字皱了皱眉。听起来她是个女性，而真嗣还从未与女性同住过。

'Well, anything is probably better than what I'm stuck with right now,' he thought.  
“嗯，不管怎样，总比我现在的情况要好吧，”他心想。

Sighing again he slumped down into a sitting position and leaned his head against the door.  
他又叹了口气，颓然坐下，将头靠在门上。

'Ah hurry the hell up, he thought. 'I wanna get this over with.'  
'啊，快点吧，'他心想，'我想赶紧结束这事。'

Shinji wasn't sure how long he sat there waiting for his roommate to wake up, but it must have been at least half an hour. Feeling that he was starting to get drowsy from sitting there for so long, he stood up and turned to face the door. 'Enough. I'm getting his ass up.'  
真嗣不确定自己坐在那里等室友醒来有多久了，但至少有半个小时。感觉自己因为坐得太久而开始犯困，他站起身来，转向门。'够了。我要把他叫起来。'

He swung the door open about to tell his roommate to get the hell up. He was shocked to see that the bed was empty and seemed to have been for several hours.  
他猛地推开门，正准备叫室友起床。却惊讶地发现床上空无一人，似乎已经离开好几个小时了。

"What the hell. This is the first time I've known him to get up early."  
“搞什么鬼。这是我第一次知道他早起。”

Shinji looked at his watch again and knew that he wouldn't be able to tell him in person.  
真嗣再次看了看手表，知道无法当面告诉他了。

"I guess I'll just leave him a note telling him I've left. I'm sure he wont care. He's been talking about having his girlfriend start sleeping over."  
"我想我会给他留张字条，告诉他我已经走了。我肯定他不会在乎的。他一直在说要让他的女朋友开始留宿。"

Shinji looked around and realized how weird it was that he was talking about this out loud to himself and suddenly felt lonely. At least he had had someone to talk to, but now...  
真嗣环顾四周，意识到自己大声谈论这件事有多奇怪，突然感到孤单。至少他曾经有个人可以交谈，但现在...

"It'll work out," he said. Then shook his head and thought, 'I've got to stop talking out loud, its weird."  
"会好起来的，"他说。然后摇了摇头想，'我得停止自言自语，这太奇怪了。"

Walking over to the table he tore off a piece of paper on the notepad that was sitting there and rummaged in his bag to find a pen that would work. Finding one that was suitable he hastily scribbled a quick message about where he was going.  
他走到桌前，从放在那里的便签本上撕下一张纸，然后在包里翻找能用的笔。找到一支合适的笔后，他匆忙地草草写下他要去哪里的信息。

Hey, I see you woke up early, odd. Anyway I'm leaving finally and thought that I should at least tell you about it. I think I told you that I might get moved again by my father, but you might not have been sober at the time. Well, I'm finally leaving now so you don't have to worry about me upsetting your girlfriend when she's over.  
嘿，我看到你早起了，真奇怪。不管怎样，我终于要走了，觉得至少应该告诉你一声。我可能跟你说过我爸可能又要搬家，但当时你可能还没清醒。好吧，我现在真的要走了，这样你就不用担心我会在你女朋友来的时候惹她不高兴了。

Shinji paused here and remembered when he had walked in on the two of them making love. The thought of that still brought stomach acid up his esophagus. Not sure how to finish it now he simply signed his name at the end of it and carried it into his room and placed it on his futon.  
真嗣在这里停顿了一下，回想起他无意中撞见他们做爱的情景。一想到那个，他仍感到胃酸涌上食道。不确定现在该如何结束，他简单地在末尾签上名字，然后拿着纸条走进房间，放在他的被褥上。

Walking back into what was considered the living room, he gave everything one last look before he turned his back on his old home and walked out the door.  
他再次走进被视为客厅的地方，在转身离开旧家之前，他最后环顾了一眼四周，然后走出了门。

---

Shinji walked the quickest way to get to his destination. He had a little under forty-five minutes to get to this cafe where he was supposed to me Misato. Taking many short cuts down alleyways and old gravel roads, he paused for a minute against a street sign catching his breath. His SDAT had repeated itself several times over now and he pulled the earphones out of his ear getting bored with the music.  
真嗣以最快的路线赶往目的地。他还有不到四十五分钟的时间到达那家咖啡馆，他要在那里与美里见面。他穿过许多小巷和老碎石路，抄了近路，在一根路标旁停下来喘口气。他的 SDAT 已经重复播放了好几次，他感到无聊，便把耳机从耳朵里取了出来。

Stuffing it back in his bag he straightened up and swung his bag over his shoulder and continued on to the cafe.  
他把 SDAT 塞回包里，挺直身子，将包甩到肩上，继续向咖啡馆走去。

When Shinji arrived his first impression of it was one of disgust. It was tucked away in a corner of the street and looked as though it was reserved for only the poor. Now though that Shinji looked around he saw that he was in one of the old slums of Tokyo-3. It looked like a shack more than anything. The sign which hung over the front of the cafe was slightly lopsided and the nails that held it to the wood where rusted and obviously strained from the weight on the metal sign. The roof looked as though it had suffered many a battering from past storms and some of the shingles were missing. Shinji figured that it smelled like rot and mold inside and decided to wait outside. Or he felt that he would be mimicking his old roommate and vomiting.  
当真嗣到达时，他对这个地方的第一印象是厌恶。它蜷缩在街道的一角，看起来似乎只留给穷人。然而现在，当真嗣环顾四周，他发现自己身处东京-3 的老旧贫民窟中。它看起来更像是一个棚屋。悬挂在咖啡馆前方的招牌略微倾斜，固定它的钉子锈迹斑斑，显然因金属招牌的重量而承受着压力。屋顶看起来经历过多次暴风雨的摧残，有些瓦片已经缺失。真嗣猜测里面弥漫着腐烂和霉菌的气味，决定在外面等待。或者，他觉得自己可能会模仿旧室友，呕吐起来。

Sitting himself down on the edge of the sidewalk he waited there for Misato to pick him up and take him away to whatever place she came from. Shinji started feeling drowsy again and tried to keep himself awake, but to no avail.  
他坐在人行道边缘，等待美里来接他，带他去她来自的任何地方。真嗣又开始感到困倦，试图保持清醒，但无济于事。

It was sometime later when Shinji awoke to the sound of a car engine. It sounded like it was in agony and if it had voice Shinji knew it would be screaming. Pushing himself up into a sitting position he looked to his left where he thought he heard the sound coming from. Suddenly he saw a blue spec speeding towards him.  
过了一段时间，真嗣被汽车引擎的声音吵醒。那声音听起来像是在痛苦中挣扎，如果引擎能说话，真嗣知道它一定会尖叫。他撑起身子坐起来，朝他认为声音传来的左边看去。突然间，他看到一个蓝色的小点正飞速向他逼近。

'Shit,' he thought. 'That drivers crazy. If I don't move out of the way I'm gonna have my feet flattened into pancake.'  
“该死，”他想，“那司机疯了。如果我不躲开，我的脚就要被压成肉饼了。”

Rolling over so that he was several feet away from the curb he was suddenly glad that he had done so. The car hadn't slowed at all and only stopped when its two wheels on its right side struck the curb and ran up along it. If Shinji hadn't backed away as far as he had, he would have been pulled under the car.  
他翻滚着离开路边几英尺远，突然庆幸自己这么做了。那辆车完全没有减速，直到右侧的两个轮子撞上路边并沿着它行驶才停下来。如果真嗣没有及时后退，他就会被卷到车底下。

Shinji felt something trickling down his arm now and looked down to see that in his haste to get out of the way he had skinned his elbow. 'Wonderful,' he thought. 'Thanks to this crazy driver I'm bleeding now.'  
真嗣感觉到有什么东西顺着他的手臂流下来，低头一看，发现自己因为急于躲避而擦伤了手肘。'真倒霉，'他想，'都怪这个疯狂的司机，我现在流血了。'

Standing up slowly, he brushed the dust off his pants and shirt and now looked at his elbow. His elbow was tinged with gravel and dirt and was starting to sting a little bit. Kneeling down he reached for his bag to take a cloth out when someone grabbed his hand. He turned around slowly to see the driver of the blue car looking at him with a worried look in her eyes.  
他慢慢地站起来，拍掉裤子和衬衫上的灰尘，然后看向自己的手肘。手肘沾满了碎石和泥土，开始有点刺痛。他跪下来伸手去拿包里的布，这时有人抓住了他的手。他缓缓转过身，看到蓝色汽车的司机正用担忧的眼神看着他。

"Your not bleeding are you?"  
“你没流血吧？”

Shinji thought it would have been rude to state the obvious and make her feel ashamed and simply shrugged it off as though it was no big deal.  
真嗣认为直接指出这一点会显得很无礼，让她感到羞愧，于是他只是耸了耸肩，好像没什么大不了的。

"You are bleeding aren't you? Oh God I'm so sorry. I was just so late that I was forced to speed most of the way here, and I didn't see you and wasn't able to stop in time."  
“你流血了，对吧？哦天哪，真对不起。我太迟了，不得不一路加速赶来，没看到你，也没能及时停下来。”

She walked back to her car and opened the glove compartment and pulled out a simple first aid kit. Shinji thought this was going a bit far and opened his mouth to say so but she simply shook her head.  
她走回自己的车，打开手套箱，拿出一个简易急救包。真嗣觉得这有点过头了，正要开口说，但她只是摇了摇头。

"Its my fault that you're injured so let me do this."  
“你受伤是我的错，所以让我来处理吧。”

Shinji simply shrugged again and let her tend to his elbow. Then he felt the stinging grow stronger and had a sudden urge to yell out. He looked down and saw that she was rubbing his elbow with a small cloth that he suspected had alcohol on it. Looking away quickly so she wouldn't see the painful expression on his face. It was an odd feeling that he wasn't able to express. It almost felt like something a mother would do. Though he wasn't sure what a mother was like, since his had died when he had been young. Thoughts of his mother led to his father and he felt boiling hatred surge through him.  
真嗣只是再次耸了耸肩，任由她处理他的手肘。随后，他感到刺痛感愈发强烈，突然有种想要大叫的冲动。他低头一看，发现她正用一块小布擦拭他的手肘，他怀疑那布上沾了酒精。他迅速移开视线，以免她看到他脸上的痛苦表情。这是一种他无法表达的奇怪感觉，几乎像是母亲会做的事情。尽管他不确切知道母亲是什么样的，因为他的母亲在他年幼时就去世了。想到母亲，他不禁想起了父亲，一股沸腾的恨意涌上心头。

This stranger must have seen this and asked if he was all right. Shinji nodded and thought that he should at least thank her for what she was trying to make up for what she had done.  
这位陌生人一定察觉到了这一点，便问他是否还好。真嗣点点头，心想至少应该感谢她，因为她正试图弥补她所造成的伤害。

"Hey...um...thanks for well...helping..."  
"嘿...嗯...谢谢你...帮忙..."

"No problem," she smiled. "Its all my fault anyway so I feel responsible for cleaning it."  
"没事的，" 她微笑着说。"反正都是我的错，所以我有责任清理干净。"

"Thanks," Shinji mumbled again.  
"谢谢，" 真嗣又咕哝了一声。

The female stranger responded by putting a bandage over Shinji's scrape. Shinji now raised his elbow looked at it. It still stung a little, but at least it was clean. He could see that some blood was trying to seep through the bandage and knew he'd have to change it later.  
那位女陌生人用一个创可贴覆盖了真嗣的擦伤。真嗣抬起手肘看了看，虽然还有点刺痛，但至少干净了。他能看到有些血迹试图透过创可贴渗出来，知道稍后得更换它。

Looking over at the female driver he finally got a good look at her face. She seemed to be in her mid to late twenties. She had long purple hair that was tied back in a pony tail and on top of her head she had a pair of sun glasses. 'Way to young to be my mother,' thought Shinji. Then he looked at her chest and was surprised to see a Nerv I.D. badge pinned to her jacket which he now saw had the Nerv emblem of a leaf embedded on the shoulder.  
他转头看向那位女司机，终于看清了她的脸。她看起来二十多岁，有着一头紫色的长发，扎成马尾，头上还戴着一副太阳镜。'年纪太小了，不可能是我妈妈，'真嗣心想。然后他注意到她的胸前别着一个 NERV 的身份证章，现在他才看到她的夹克肩部嵌有 NERV 的叶子标志。

"Look I'm really sorry about what happened just now. I just..."  
“听着，我真的很抱歉刚才发生的事。我只是……”

"Don't worry so much about it. You've more than made up for what just happened." Shinji now gave her a small smile that she returned somewhat forcefully.  
"别太担心了。你已经远远弥补了刚才发生的事。" 真嗣现在给了她一个微笑，她也有些用力地回应了他。

Shinji surprised himself at the bluntness of his next question. "You don't happen to work at Nerv do you?"  
真嗣对自己接下来问题的直率感到惊讶。"你不会正好在 NERV 工作吧？"

The female driver frowned at him. "I didn't know many people knew about the existence of Nerv."  
女司机皱着眉看着他。"我没想到很多人都知道 NERV 的存在。"

"Well, the badge is in full few and you've got the emblem on your jacket. So it was a little bit obvious."  
"嗯，徽章闪闪发亮，你的夹克上也有标志。所以稍微有点明显。"

"How do you know so much? Do you know someone who works there?"  
"你怎么知道这么多？你认识那里工作的人吗？"

"Err yeah. My father does, at least, last time I talked to him he did. Though that was about a year ago."  
"呃，是的。我父亲在那儿工作，至少上次我跟他通话时是这样。虽然那已经是大约一年前的事了。"

"Your father," said the female driver now with a shocked look on her face.  
"你父亲，"女司机此刻脸上露出震惊的表情。

"I think so. Why you don't know him do you?"  
"我想是的。你怎么会不认识他呢？"

"Wait," she paused. "Your last name doesn't happen to be Ikari does it?"  
"等等，"她停顿了一下。"你的姓氏该不会是碇吧？"

"Yeah it does," said Shinji just as surprised.  
“是啊，确实如此，”真嗣同样感到惊讶地说道。

Suddenly the female driver sat down on the curb next to him and laughed out. This shocked Shinji more than anything that had happened so far that day. Her mood immediately changed from concerned to one of complete laxness. She suddenly hit him rather hard on the back, looked at him again, and laughed.  
突然，女司机坐在了他旁边的路边，放声大笑。这让真嗣比那天发生的任何事情都更加震惊。她的情绪立刻从关切转变为完全的放松。她突然重重地拍了一下他的背，再次看着他，又笑了起来。

"So I take it you know my dad?"  
“这么说，你认识我爸爸？”

"Know him. Everyone in Nerv knows who your father is. I work for him. He's the man thats in charge of Nerv. Gendo Ikari is well known for his experiments with-"  
"认识他。NERV 里的每个人都知道你父亲是谁。我为他工作。他是 NERV 的负责人。碇源堂因其与……"

She cut herself off and Shinji looked back at her rather blankly.  
她突然停了下来，真嗣茫然地回头看着她。

"Well," she said. "This makes my job a lot easier. Though I never would have thought that I'd almost run you over. I was a bit worried that you would have gotten tired of waiting for me."  
"好吧，"她说。"这让我的工作轻松多了。虽然我从没想过会差点撞到你。我还担心你会等得不耐烦呢。"

Shinji frowned at her, "You act as though you were planning to meet with...wait," and here Shinji turned to her and his eyes widened slightly. "You don't happen to be Misato Katsuragi."  
真嗣皱着眉头看着她，"你表现得好像是计划去见...等等，"说到这里，真嗣转向她，眼睛微微睁大。"你该不会就是葛城美里吧。"

She simply winked at him and said, "Bingo Shinji."  
她只是向他眨了眨眼，说："答对了，真嗣。"

Shinji was surprised but also felt happy with the change of circumstances. "So I take it that I'll be living with you for a while," he asked.  
真嗣感到惊讶，但也对情况的转变感到高兴。"那么，我是不是要和你一起住一段时间？"他问道。

"That appears to be so."  
"看来确实如此。"

Shinji suddenly felt happier than he could last remember. She didn't seem all that much like an adult now that she knew who he was but he didn't seem to care. He was just happy that he seemed to be able to talk with her easily.  
真嗣突然感到比他最近记忆中的任何时候都要快乐。她现在知道他是谁了，看起来并不那么像一个成年人，但他似乎并不介意。他只是很高兴能和她轻松地交谈。

"Well," she said standing up. "Now that I found you I suggest that we head back to my apartment and get you settled in." She looked at the bag that was sitting next to him. "I take it thats all the stuff you own."  
"好吧，"她站起身来说道，"既然我找到了你，我建议我们回我的公寓，让你安顿下来。"她看了看他旁边的包，"我想这就是你所有的东西了吧。"

Shinji looked down and nodded. It wasn't a whole lot of stuff. Most of it he had had for several years and he needed to get some new clothes. His old ones were starting to get too small.  
真嗣低头看了看，点了点头。东西并不多。大部分他已经用了好几年，需要添置些新衣服了。旧的已经开始显得太小了。

"Well, I think that I'll have to take you shopping sometime so you can get whatever you like. I take it you haven't had many choices to choose what you want."  
“嗯，我想我得找个时间带你去购物，这样你可以买到你喜欢的任何东西。我猜你之前没多少选择自己想要的东西的机会吧。”

Shinji continued to look down and mumbled a barely audible 'no.'  
真嗣继续低着头，用几乎听不见的声音咕哝了一声‘没有’。

Misato looked at him and felt a small smile appear on her face. Tapping him slightly on the shoulder she gestured for him to put his stuff in the back, which he did.  
美里看着他，脸上不由自主地露出了微笑。她轻轻拍了拍他的肩膀，示意他把东西放到后面去，他照做了。

"OK," she said. "Next stop my apartment. And I'll try not to drive too sporadically so you don't feel sick."  
“好，”她说，“下一站是我的公寓。我会尽量平稳驾驶，免得你晕车。”

At this point Shinji was just happy to have found somebody that seemed to care about him.  
此时，真嗣只是庆幸自己找到了一个似乎关心他的人。

---

Whatever Misato Katsuragi was, she was not clean. Navigating through the mess that was her apartment was almost impossible. Shinji took a small room adjacent to another room that was currently empty. He had thought about asking why he wasn't using that one, but decided it was best not to be rude. She was giving him a place to sleep after all.  
无论米萨托·卡苏拉基是什么样的人，她绝不是个整洁的人。穿越她那乱糟糟的公寓几乎是不可能的任务。真嗣住进了一个紧邻另一间空房间的小房间。他本想问为什么不让他住那间，但觉得还是不要失礼为好。毕竟，她给了他一个睡觉的地方。

One thing that he hadn't been expecting about her was the fact that she drank a lot of beer. Upon opening the fridge to get something to drink, he saw more six packs of beer than what had been at his old roommates place. Shinji wasn't sure whether to laugh, or feel annoyed and simply closed it and got water out of the tap.  
有一件事他没料到，那就是她喝很多啤酒。打开冰箱想找点喝的，他发现啤酒六包装的数量比他以前的室友那儿还多。真嗣不确定是该笑，还是感到恼火，最后他只是关上冰箱，从水龙头接了水喝。

Misato had to go back to work almost immediately when they had gotten back and said that she wouldn't be back until later in the afternoon. She said that she would tell his father that she had picked him up, and that now he was now living in her apartment. Shinji was guessing that his father didn't care. As long as he wasn't bothering him at all.  
米萨托几乎一回来就得立刻回去工作，她说下午晚些时候才能回来。她告诉他，她会通知他父亲已经把他接来了，现在他住在她的公寓里。真嗣猜想他父亲并不在乎。只要他不打扰他就行。

Shinji had gotten tired of the bottles of beer and bags of junk food littering the floor and decided to do clean the apartment. From what he saw, she mainly ate take out or instant meals.  
真嗣对满地的啤酒瓶和垃圾食品袋感到厌倦，决定打扫一下公寓。从他看到的来看，她主要吃外卖或速食。

'Well, good thing I taught myself how to cook these past years,' thought Shinji.  
'还好这几年我自学了烹饪，'真嗣心想。

Finished with the cleaning, he proceeded to take a shower but opened the wrong door and found himself face to face with a penguin. Shinji let out a loud yell that could be heard several floors down as he backed up to the fridge reaching for a blunt object. The penguin simply looked back at him blinking at him sleepily. Yawning widely the penguin grasped a hold of the sliding door and closed it once again, but not before giving a loud squawk in Shinji's direction  
打扫完毕后，他去洗澡，却误开了另一扇门，迎面撞见一只企鹅。真嗣惊声尖叫，声音响彻几层楼，他后退到冰箱旁，伸手去拿钝器。企鹅只是睡眼惺忪地眨眼看着他。打了个大大的哈欠，企鹅抓住推拉门再次关上，临走前还朝真嗣的方向发出一声响亮的鸣叫。

Shinji's heart was beating faster than he could last remember. 'What the hell is that woman thinking. Keeping a penguin in an environment like this.' Now though he wondered if the penguin had some bit of intelligence in it and decided to ask her later.  
真嗣的心跳比他记忆中任何时候都要快。'那个女人到底在想什么。在这种环境下养企鹅。' 不过现在他好奇那只企鹅是否有些许智慧，决定稍后再问她。

Sighing slightly he walked to the correct bathroom this time, stripped quickly, and was pleased to feel the hot water hitting his skin. For no apparent reason, his thoughts strayed to last night when he had seen that girl down by the shore against the setting sun. If he knew that things would have happened like this and he would be staying in Tokyo-3, then he would have asked her name at least. Though now it seemed that he wouldn't see her again. "Wonder what she's like..." He wondered out loud.  
他轻叹一声，这次走向了正确的浴室，迅速脱掉衣服，感受着热水洒在皮肤上的舒适。不知为何，他的思绪飘到了昨晚，他在海边看到那个女孩，夕阳映衬着她的身影。如果他早知道事情会变成这样，他会留在第三新东京市，至少会问她的名字。但现在看来，他可能再也见不到她了。“不知道她是什么样的人...”他自言自语道。

Suddenly he hit his head against the wall of the shower. Certain thoughts had just crossed his mind and he didn't quite appreciate them. He didn't even know who she was. Hadn't even seen her face for that matter. 'Stop thinking like that you idiot. The chances of seeing her again are almost nil.'  
突然间，他的头撞到了淋浴间的墙上。某些念头刚刚闪过他的脑海，他并不喜欢这些想法。他甚至不知道她是谁，连她的脸都没看清。'别再这么想了，你这个傻瓜。再见到她的可能性几乎为零。'

Turning off the hot water before anything else crossed his mind, he wrapped a towel around his waist and walked to his bedroom to change.  
他首先关掉了热水，然后围上一条毛巾，走向卧室换衣服。

Misato didn't come home until late at night. Shinji had fallen asleep in his new room with his SDAT waiting for her to come home. He awoke when he heard her stumbling around the kitchen and slid his door open a little to see her looking in the fridge for something.  
美里直到深夜才回家。真嗣在他的新房间里睡着了，SDAT 播放器还在等着她回来。听到她在厨房里跌跌撞撞的声音，他醒了过来，轻轻拉开房门，看到她在冰箱里找东西。

"Misato-san, you're home later than you said you would be."  
“美里小姐，你回来得比说的要晚呢。”

"Oh sorry Shinji. I had some things I had to take care of. Thanks for cleaning up around her. I've been meaning to, but I just don't have enough time."  
“哦，抱歉，真嗣。我有些事情需要处理。谢谢你帮她打扫。我一直想做，但就是没时间。”

Shinji highly doubted that she would have cleaned, even if she had a week of nothing to do, but he didn't care. It kept him occupied at least when he had nothing to do.  
真嗣高度怀疑即使她有一周的空闲时间，她也不会打扫，但他并不在意。至少在他无所事事时，这让他有事可做。

Sitting down in a chair next to her, he frowned when he saw that she had a can of beer in her hand. Even though Shinji was only fifteen he knew that drinking before bed wasn't the smartest thing to do, and opened his mouth to say something when she cut across him.  
他坐在她旁边的椅子上，看到她手里拿着一罐啤酒时皱起了眉头。尽管真嗣只有十五岁，但他知道睡前喝酒不是明智之举，正要开口说些什么时，她打断了他。

"I talked to your father and he wanted me to tell you something."  
"我和你父亲谈过了，他有些话让我转告你。"

Shinji wasn't it the mood to listen to anything that his father felt worthwhile but simply nodded.  
真嗣此刻并无心情听父亲认为有价值的事，只是简单地点了点头。

"He wants you to continue going to the school your currently attending."  
"他希望你继续在目前就读的学校学习。"

Shinji was surprised at this. "Does he want to keep me here for a while or something?"  
真嗣对此感到惊讶。“他是想让我在这里待一段时间吗？”

"Can't say," said Misato taking a huge gulp of beer.  
“不好说，”美里说着，猛灌了一大口啤酒。

"I met that penguin of yours but the way," said Shinji.  
“我顺便见到了你的那只企鹅，”真嗣说道。

Misato raised an eyebrow at him and put her beer down. "Forgot that I hadn't shown Pen-Pen to you yet. He didn't attack you or anything did he?"  
美里对他挑了挑眉，放下手中的啤酒。“忘了我还没带你见过 Pen-Pen 呢。他没攻击你吧？”

"No. Seemed like I woke him up though, but he just went back to sleep."  
“没有。不过我好像把他吵醒了，但他只是又睡回去了。”

"Just like him." She finished her beer and belched rather unladylike. She was a lot different than what he had expected.  
“他就这样。”她喝完啤酒，打了个相当不淑女的嗝。她和他的预期大相径庭。

"I'm going to bed now. I expect you to go to school like a good boy tomorrow. Make sure you do go, or you'll have to answer to me."  
"我现在要去睡觉了。我希望你明天能像个乖孩子一样去上学。一定要去，否则你得向我解释。"

Shinji chuckled, "You sound like a mother."  
真嗣轻笑道：“你听起来像个妈妈。”

"I'm now your guardian so its only natural that I look after you."  
"我现在是你的监护人，所以照顾你是理所当然的。"

Shinji blinked and felt tears forming in his eyes and hastily wiped them away with the back of his hand.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，感觉泪水在眼眶中形成，急忙用手背擦去。

"Well, I'll see you tomorrow Shinji, good night."  
“那么，明天见，真嗣，晚安。”

"Yeah, good night Misato."  
“嗯，晚安，美里。”

---

When Shinji arrived at school the next day whispers followed him wherever he went. Apparently most of the kids had thought he had finally dropped out. They were therefore surprised to see him there the next day. True to his word Shinji, didn't even bring his SDAT so that it wouldn't distract him. Now that he had a place that he could happily call home he felt like putting more of an effort into his school work, even if the other kids didn't believe him.  
第二天，当真嗣踏入学校时，耳边传来的窃窃私语如影随形。显然，大多数孩子都以为他终于退学了。因此，看到他第二天出现在学校，他们都感到惊讶。正如他承诺的那样，真嗣甚至没有带上他的 SDAT，以免分心。现在他有了一个可以称之为家的温馨之地，他觉得自己应该更加努力学习，即使其他孩子不相信他。

His teacher still didn't think that he was trying seriously though, and ignored him for most of the day. The morning passed without much of a difference in what Shinji was normally used to, and he was just thinking of going home when there teacher addressed them.  
尽管如此，他的老师仍然认为他没有认真对待学习，大部分时间都忽视了他。上午的时光与真嗣平常所经历的并无太大差别，正当他想着回家时，老师向他们讲话了。

"We have a new student that will be joining us today. She is an exchange student from Germany and she can speak Japanese fluently. She has also graduated from a German university at the age of fourteen and is extremely brilliant."  
“我们今天有一位新同学加入。她是从德国来的交换生，日语说得非常流利。她在十四岁时就从德国的一所大学毕业，极其聪明。”

He looked up from the piece of paper that he was reading from and looking towards the door. "Is that it then?" he asked with a slight annoyed tone in his voice?  
他从正在阅读的纸张上抬起头，望向门口。“就这样了吗？”他带着一丝不悦的语气问道？

"Yeah, thats enough," said an energetic voice from the other side of the door leading out into the hallway.  
“是的，够了，”门外走廊传来一个充满活力的声音。

Shinji was starring out the window and was only picking up about half of this. 'Just another annoying girl like the rest of them,' he thought.  
真嗣正望着窗外，只听进了一半的内容。'不过是又一个像其他女孩一样烦人的家伙，'他心想。

Again there teacher starting talking but the girl had cut across him now. "I can introduce myself," she said.  
老师再次开始讲话，但女孩此刻打断了他。“我可以自我介绍，”她说。

Even though Shinji wasn't paying attention to what was going on he could tell that a change in the room had happened. All the guys around him had started whispering all at once and Shinji could only assume that it had something to do with the new girl.  
尽管真嗣没有注意周围发生的事情，但他能感觉到房间里发生了变化。他周围的男生们突然同时开始窃窃私语，真嗣只能猜测这与新来的女孩有关。

The girl had started talking again either oblivious to the muttering of the guys or simply enjoying it.  
女孩又开始说话了，无论是对男生们的低语浑然不觉，还是单纯地享受着这种氛围。

Shinji heard the light tapping of chalk against the board and now heard her start talking again though this time he was paying attention enough to at least get her name.  
真嗣听到粉笔轻敲黑板的声音，现在又听到她开始讲话了，这次他至少注意到了她的名字。

"My name is Asuka Langely Soryu. Pleasure to meet all of you."  
“我叫惣流·明日香·兰格雷。很高兴见到大家。”

All at once their was a massive babbling from all the guys except Shinji who was once again ignoring the whole thing. Asuka had questions launched at her from all over the place and she couldn't help but smirk as all the guys fawned over her.  
一瞬间，除了真嗣外，所有男生都开始七嘴八舌起来。明日香被四面八方的问题轰炸，忍不住对那些围着她献殷勤的男生们露出得意的笑容。

It took sometime for there teacher to get everyone quieted down. When he had yelled at several guys who had tried to get her phone number and threatened several others to send them to the principles office, he told Asuka to take the empty seat in front of Shinji.  
花了些时间，老师才让所有人安静下来。他对着几个试图要她电话号码的男生大吼，又威胁要把其他几个人送到校长办公室，然后让 Asuka 坐在 Shinji 前面的空位上。

Shinji only caught this last part and sighed slightly. From the sound of this girl, she thought that she was superior to everyone else. He would have preferred to just continue looking out the window, but saw that somebody was standing over him.  
Shinji 只听到了最后这部分，微微叹了口气。从这女孩的语气来看，她自认为高人一等。他本想继续望着窗外，却注意到有人站在他面前。

Looking away from the window he came face to face with Asuka, who was starring back at him. The entire classroom had gone quiet and Shinji felt his heart stop as soon as he looked into her face.  
他转过视线，不再看向窗外，迎面遇上了 Asuka 的目光，她正盯着他。整个教室都安静了下来，Shinji 一看到她的脸，心跳仿佛都停止了。

'No way,' he thought. 'She can't be, but...no its gotta be her.'  
“不可能，”他心想，“她不可能是，但……不，肯定是她。”

He was looking up into the face of the girl he had seen on the beach. Her hair was the correct color and Shinji confirmed that it was her when he saw the hair clips that she had in her hair. His eyes strayed to her face and saw that she had blue eyes which seemed to be rather stern. He couldn't believe that he was looking into the face of her, and that he also knew her name now. What's more she was looking at him rather intently and curiously. 'This is awkward,' thought Shinji as beads of sweat formed on his forehead.  
他抬头看着那个在海滩上见过的女孩的脸。她的发色完全吻合，当看到她头发上的发夹时，真嗣确认了就是她。他的目光移到她的脸上，发现她有着相当严肃的蓝色眼睛。他不敢相信自己正凝视着她的脸，而且现在还知道了她的名字。更甚的是，她正相当专注且好奇地看着他。“这真尴尬，”真嗣想着，额头上冒出了汗珠。

Suddenly she put her hand out and flicked her forefinger against his forehead making him flinch slightly. Shinji wasn't sure what to make of this behavior. Was she teasing him, or what?  
突然，她伸出手，用食指弹了一下他的额头，让他微微一缩。真嗣不确定她这是什么意思。是在逗他吗，还是别的什么？

Suddenly their teacher cleared his throat slightly and Asuka turned around to frown at him. Shinji's eyes strayed over her again taking her in. Shinji felt that if he continued to stare at her, he would start having strange thoughts again, and quickly turned his gaze back to the window. Asuka saw this and now there was a very annoyed look on her face. She turned her back on him and sat down in front of him.  
突然，他们的老师轻轻清了清喉咙，明日香转过身来皱眉看着他。真嗣的目光再次掠过她，细细打量。真嗣觉得如果继续盯着她看，他又会开始产生奇怪的想法，于是迅速将视线转回窗外。明日香看到这一幕，脸上露出了非常不悦的表情。她转过身背对着他，坐在他前面。

Shinji could hear the muttering of the fellow males in his classroom all discussing what had just happened between the two. "Why does he get to sit behind her?"  
真嗣能听到教室里其他男生在窃窃私语，讨论着刚才两人之间发生的事情。"为什么他能坐在她后面？"

"And why did she flick his forehead? Do they know each other from somewhere?"  
“还有，她为什么弹他的额头？他们是不是在哪儿认识？”

Shinji was getting annoyed at this, and saw that in front of him Asuka was steadily turning red.  
这让真嗣感到恼火，他看到前方的明日香正逐渐涨红了脸。

However the teacher started to call out roll and brought the class back order.  
然而，老师开始点名，将课堂秩序恢复了。

Asuka meanwhile was thinking about what had just happened. When she had walked into the class every single guy was drooling over her, though that one behind her hadn't even flinched when she walked in. Either he was gay, retarded, or had no emotions of which she thought the last one was mostly true. She had attempted to get a reaction out of him by flirting with him a little, just to tease him, but he didn't even respond. 'How pathetic,' she thought. She couldn't stand weak guys.  
与此同时，明日香正在思考刚刚发生的事情。当她走进教室时，每个男生都对她垂涎三尺，唯独她身后的那个家伙在她进来时连眼皮都没动一下。要么他是同性恋，要么是智力障碍，要么就是毫无情感，她认为最后一种可能性最大。她试图通过稍微调情来激起他的反应，只是为了逗逗他，但他甚至没有任何回应。'真是可悲，'她想。她无法忍受软弱的男人。

Meanwhile the teacher had continued to call out names and Asuka answered when she heard hers called. When the teacher asked if Ayanami Rei was still absent Asuka smirked, 'So the precious First Child goes to this school as well. What a fun experience that will be, trying to have a conversation with the doll. She's even more lifeless than the guy behind me.'  
与此同时，老师继续点名，听到自己的名字时，明日香应了一声。当老师询问绫波零是否仍缺席时，明日香轻蔑一笑，'原来那个珍贵的第一适格者也在这所学校啊。跟那个娃娃交流一定很有趣，她比坐在我后面的家伙还要死气沉沉。'

The teacher went through the list of names and Shinji was starting to wonder if his name was even still on their when the teacher called out his name rather reluctantly.  
老师逐一念出名单上的名字，真嗣开始怀疑自己的名字是否还在上面，这时老师颇为勉强地叫出了他的名字。

"And Shinji Ikari. You're still here aren't you?" It was as if the teacher wished he wasn't.  
“还有碇真嗣，你还在这里吧？”仿佛老师希望他不在似的。

"Yeah," replied Shinji. 'Though I sure as hell don't want to be,' he thought.  
“嗯，”真嗣回答道。'虽然我绝对不想这样，'他心想。

Asuka however had spun around in her chair when she heard Shinji's last name, and frowned at him.  
然而，听到真嗣的姓氏后，明日香在椅子上转过身来，皱着眉头看向他。

Shinji noticed this but continued to stare out the window. 'God what is wrong with her? As far as I know she has no reason to hate me at all. Or is she just normally annoyed at everyone?'  
真嗣注意到了这一点，但继续凝视着窗外。'上帝啊，她怎么了？据我所知，她没有任何理由恨我。还是她对每个人都这样烦躁？'

Asuka had heard that Shinji's last name was Ikari but was still surprised to hear it. 'So your the son of Gendo Ikari who's in charge of Nerv, huh. I guess going to this school wasn't a complete waste of my time.'  
明日香曾听说真嗣的姓氏是碇，但亲耳听到还是感到惊讶。'原来你是那个负责 NERV 的碇源堂的儿子啊。看来来这所学校也不完全是浪费我的时间。'

Turning around, Asuka faced the front of the room, ignoring Shinji for the rest of the class period.  
明日香转过身，面向教室前方，整个课间再也没有理会真嗣。

Shinji however couldn't help but have his eyes stray towards her occasionally. She was really quite beautiful, even if her attitude was a little rough. Shinji was really starting to wish that he had just asked her name yesterday. If he had, maybe things wouldn't have gotten off to such a rough start.  
然而，真嗣忍不住时不时将目光投向她。她真的很美，尽管态度有些粗鲁。真嗣开始后悔昨天没有问她的名字。如果当时问了，也许事情就不会一开始就那么糟糕。

---

After school Shinji slowly walked back towards Misato's apartment. He figured that she would be wanting to hear about what he did in school today. 'She can be a bit annoying at times,' he thought. But then she was the best roommate that he had, so he wasn't complaining.  
放学后，真嗣缓缓走向美里小姐的公寓。他猜想她会想听听他今天在学校做了些什么。'她有时确实有点烦人，'他想。但她是他最好的室友，所以他并不抱怨。

As Shinji walked he couldn't help but notice that Asuka was walking on the sidewalk opposite of where he was. It seemed that the two of them where heading in the same direction and Shinji felt slightly nervous, remembering that their paths would cross at the next intersection.  
真嗣走着走着，忍不住注意到明日香在他对面的便道上走着。看起来他们俩正朝着同一个方向前进，真嗣感到有些紧张，记得他们的路线会在下一个路口交汇。

As she crossed the sidewalk to get on his side, he hurriedly sped up so that he could be in front of her. He was nervous now about talking to her, considering she seemed to dislike him. Shinji really didn't want to talk with her right now, and constantly looked over his shoulder to check that she was still a good distance away. Call him a coward if you will, but the last thing he wanted was to get on this girls bad side. Surprisingly though, he heard her calling out to him.  
当她穿过便道来到他这边时，他急忙加快脚步，以便能走在她前面。他现在对和她说话感到紧张，考虑到她似乎不喜欢他。真嗣真的不想现在和她说话，并不时回头确认她还在一段距离之外。如果你愿意，可以称他为懦夫，但他最不想的就是惹恼这个女孩。然而，出乎意料的是，他听到她在叫他。

"Oi, you, from this morning. Slow down a minute, I want to talk to you."  
“喂，你，今早的那个。慢点儿，我有话跟你说。”

Shinji did his best to ignore her, and kept walking forward, but his pace quickened slightly. He heard hurried footsteps behind him however, and soon, Asuka was matching her pace with his, several feet behind him. Ignoring her he continued to walk at a steady pace.  
真嗣尽力忽视她，继续向前走，但脚步稍稍加快了些。然而，他听到身后急促的脚步声，不久，明日香便与他保持了几步之遥，步伐一致。他继续稳稳地走着，对她视而不见。

'My god,' she thought in German. 'What does it take to get a reaction from this idiot?'  
“我的天，”她用德语想，“要怎样才能让这个白痴有点反应？”

She continued walking directly behind him, but changed pace again, so that she was walking at the same pace next to him. Shinji couldn't help it, and glanced over at her. Asuka was looking over at him. Her lips were smiling, but there was something malicious in her eyes that Shinji didn't care for.  
她继续直接跟在他身后走着，但又改变了步伐，以便与他并肩而行。真嗣忍不住瞥了她一眼。明日香正看着他。她的嘴角带着笑意，但眼中却闪烁着真嗣不喜欢的恶意。

'Does she expect me to say something? Or should I be acting like all the other guys in my classroom did?'  
'她是不是期待我说些什么？还是我应该像班上其他男生那样表现？'

Asuka didn't try say anything to him though, and after walking alongside him for a while in silence, Shinji heard her mumble something inaudible under her breath, and then she sped up past him, throwing him a rather vicious glance as she did.  
然而，明日香并没有试图对他说什么，在沉默中与他并肩走了一会儿后，真嗣听到她低声咕哝了一句听不清的话，然后她加快脚步超过了他，经过时还狠狠地瞪了他一眼。

Shinji slowed down, and then stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, looking up at the sky. 'Wonderful,' he thought. 'I get a cool roommate who acts like my guardian, but now I've met the strangest girl ever. Great way to start my new life out.'  
真嗣放慢了脚步，然后在人行道中央停了下来，抬头望向天空。'真是奇妙，'他心想，'我有了一个酷似监护人的室友，但现在又遇到了有史以来最奇怪的女孩。开启新生活的绝佳方式啊。'

Sighing slightly, he returned his eyes to the sidewalk, and continued walking. He was rather eager to get back to Misato's apartment, his new home, but he wished that Asuka would just go back to Germany.  
他轻轻叹了口气，将目光转回人行道上，继续前行。他相当渴望回到美里小姐的公寓，他的新家，但他希望明日香能直接回德国去。

---

"Misato I'm back," Shinji called as he took off his shoes and stepped into the apartment.  
“美里小姐，我回来了，”真嗣一边喊着，一边脱下鞋子走进了公寓。

"Ah good I was just getting worried. You took longer than I expected."  
"啊，太好了，我正担心呢。你比我想象中花的时间要长。"

"Well, some things happened," said Shinji as he walked into the kitchen and stopped dead when he saw that Misato was drinking tea with someone.  
"嗯，发生了一些事情，" 真嗣说着走进厨房，却在看到美里正和某人喝茶时愣住了。

Asuka was sitting at the kitchen table with Misato holding a tea cup in her hand which immediately fell to the floor, shattering, sending tea in all directions.  
明日香坐在厨房的桌子旁，手里拿着茶杯，茶杯立刻掉到地上，碎裂开来，茶水四溅。

Shinji blinked blankly back and suddenly realized what she was wearing. She was dressed in a loose tang-top which fell loosely around her chest revealing a little more then Shinji cared to comment on. She had apparently abandoned the need to even bother with pants and was in nothing more than her underwear, which were also white. What's more she had removed the hair clips and now her hair was meshed together in one long wave.  
真嗣茫然地眨了眨眼，随即突然意识到她穿的是什么。她身着一件宽松的唐装上衣，松松垮垮地垂在胸前，露出了比真嗣愿意评论的还要多的部分。她显然已经放弃了穿裤子的念头，只穿着内衣，同样也是白色的。更甚的是，她摘掉了发夹，现在她的头发如同一道长长的波浪般披散着。

Asuka stared blankly back at him for several seconds before shouting, "WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?"  
明日香茫然地盯着他看了几秒钟，然后大喊道：“这他妈是什么鬼？”

She ran at him and grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him ferociously. Thankfully Misato stepped in between them before she was able to cause him any more bodily harm.  
她向他冲去，抓住他的肩膀猛烈摇晃。幸好美里及时介入，阻止了她进一步对他造成身体伤害。

"Asuka calm down," said Misato as she dragged her away from Shinji.  
“Asuka，冷静点，”Misato 边说边把她从 Shinji 身边拉开。

"Why is he here!?" “他为什么在这里！？”

Misato simply laughed. "I see that the two of you know each other from somewhere."  
Misato 只是笑了笑。“看来你们俩之前在哪儿见过面。”

Shinji now spoke up and said, "Unfortunately yes."  
真嗣这时开口说道：“不幸的是，确实如此。”

"What was?" yelled Asuka.  
“什么确实如此？”明日香大声问道。

"Now come on you two," said Misato. "You guys are both going to be living here, so I expect you to be able to get along."  
“好啦，你们两个，”美里说，“你们俩以后都要住在这里，所以我希望你们能和睦相处。”

They both stared blankly back at her.  
他们俩都茫然地回望着她。

"Come again?" asked Asuka. "I don't think I heard you correctly?"  
"再说一遍？" 明日香问道，"我觉得我没听清楚？"

"You. Two. Will. Be. Living. Together. Here," repeated Misato.  
"你们两个。将要。一起。住在这里，" 美里重复道。

Asuka looked blankly back at her and then turned around and walked out of the kitchen.  
明日香茫然地回头看了她一眼，然后转身走出了厨房。

"Asuka where are you going?" asked Misato as Asuka gathered up her things.  
“明日香，你要去哪儿？”美里问道，而明日香正在收拾自己的东西。

"I'm leaving. No way in hell can I live in the same apartment with this moron."  
“我要走了。我绝不可能和这个白痴住在同一个公寓里。”

With that she slammed the door and left the apartment.  
说完，她砰地一声关上门，离开了公寓。

Shinji was left standing alone in the kitchen as the whole thing hit him. 'Oh God. Me and Asuka living together? I wouldn't survive a day.' However when Misato came back in, she told him that Asuka had left without any intention of coming back.  
真嗣独自站在厨房里，这一切突然击中了他。'哦，天哪。我和明日香住在一起？我一天都撑不过去。'然而，当美里回来时，她告诉他明日香已经离开，没有回来的打算。

"What the hell happened between the two of you?" asked Misato.  
“你们俩之间到底发生了什么？”美里问道。

"...I'm not even sure," was all Shinji said, before he launched into the school day and what happened afterwards.  
“……我也不确定，”真嗣只说了这么一句，便开始讲述起学校里发生的事以及之后的经过。

---

By the time he had finished several hours had gone by and she could hear the steady plop plop as it started to rain outside.  
当他讲完时，几个小时已经过去了，她能听到外面开始下雨，传来一阵阵稳定的滴答声。

Misato looked out the window. She was starting to get worried about Asuka. She had left in nothing but that tang-top and underwear and was worried that she would be getting cold by now.  
美里望向窗外。她开始担心明日香了。明日香只穿着那件吊带衫和内衣就出去了，她担心她现在可能已经感到冷了。

Walking into the living room she saw that Shinji was contently sitting on the couch listening to his SDAT and reading a book. 'Does he really not care about here? Its not like she's the most unattractive girl out there.' Then she suddenly winced at the prospect of someone taking advantage of her with it raining like this.  
走进客厅，她看到真嗣正惬意地坐在沙发上，听着他的 SDAT，读着一本书。'他真的不在乎这里吗？她又不像是最不吸引人的女孩。'随后她突然因想到在这样的雨天有人可能会利用她而皱起了眉头。

"Shinji get up," she said pushing against his arm rather forcibly.  
“真嗣，起来，”她相当用力地推了推他的手臂说道。

"Huh...Oh Misato, what do you want?"  
“嗯...哦，美里，你想要什么？”

"What I want is for you to go out and find Asuka."  
"我想要的是你去找到明日香。"

Shinji frowned, "Why? You heard her, she doesn't want to be in the same room with me."  
真嗣皱眉，"为什么？你听到了，她不想和我待在同一个房间里。"

"So are you saying you aren't worried about her at all?"  
"那么你是说你一点都不担心她吗？"

"I..." he hesitated. "She can taking of herself," he said finally.  
"我..." 他犹豫了一下。"她能照顾好自己，" 他最终说道。

"Look its raining out and she's left in clothes that aren't even suitable for the summer."  
"看，外面在下雨，她却穿着连夏天都不合适的衣服。"

"Thats her problem not mine."  
"那是她的问题，不是我的。"

This earned him a slap. Putting his hand up to his face, he felt the spot that stung slightly from where Misato's hand had struck him. Looking up, he saw that she was glaring at him with something close to hatred.  
这让他挨了一巴掌。他抬起手摸向脸颊，感觉到被美里手掌击中的地方微微刺痛。抬头一看，只见她正用近乎憎恨的目光瞪着他。

"Are you that insensitive, Shinji? Do you seriously not care what could happen to her? She's out there in the freezing rain, possibly being picked up by some guy in a truck with who knows what happening to her. And you say that it's her problem not yours. She's right you don't have emotions. You're a coward."  
“你就这么迟钝吗，真嗣？你真的不在乎她可能遭遇什么吗？她在外面冰冷的雨中，可能被某个开着卡车的家伙带走，谁知道会发生什么。而你却说那是她的问题，不是你的。她说的没错，你没有感情。你是个懦夫。”

He looked back at her and suddenly felt ashamed of himself for thinking like that. She was right he was emotionless and a coward.  
他回望向她，突然为自己那样想感到羞愧。她说得对，他是个没有感情的懦夫。

Sitting bolt upright now he flung himself off the couch and ran to his room tossing on a pair of jeans a long sleeve shirt and a jacket. He was about to leave the room when he decided that he better bring a spare for Asuka.  
他猛地坐直身子，从沙发上跳下来，冲进自己的房间，迅速套上一条牛仔裤、一件长袖衬衫和一件夹克。正要离开房间时，他决定最好给明日香带件备用的。

He ran out of his room and found himself face to face with Misato.  
他跑出房间，迎面撞上了美里。

"I...I-I'm sorry for being such an insensitive jerk. I'll be sure to find her and bring her back."  
“我……我……我很抱歉，我真是个不体贴的混蛋。我一定会找到她，把她带回来。”

With that he ran out the door into the downpour.  
说完，他便冲出门外，投身于倾盆大雨之中。

Misato smiled slightly at him now, "Hmph he just doesn't want to let on to his emotions."  
美里此刻对他微微一笑，"哼，他就是不想表露自己的情感。"

---

Shinji ran through Tokyo-3, thinking of all the possibilities where Asuka could have gone. It had been at least three hours since she left and forty-five minutes since this downpour had started. 'She must have found shelter somewhere,' he thought and decided to check around some of the slums that littered Tokyo-3. Though he hoped that she had stayed out of those. Even though he had only known her for a short while, and he couldn't say he liked her, he was feeling worried for her sake.  
真嗣在第三新东京市中奔跑，脑海里不断闪现着明日香可能去的地方。她离开至少已有三个小时，而这场大雨也已持续了四十五分钟。'她一定在某处找到了避雨的地方，'他想，并决定去检查一下遍布第三新东京市的贫民窟。尽管他希望她没有涉足那些地方。虽然他认识她不久，也谈不上喜欢她，但他还是为她感到担忧。

Soon Shinji found himself going door to door to peoples houses asking if they had seen a girl around age fifteen or sixteen with long red hair and blue eyes. He didn't feel like mentioning what she was wearing. None of them where able to provide any answer and Shinji eventually decided that she wasn't in this part of Tokyo-3.  
不久，真嗣发现自己挨家挨户地敲门，询问是否有人见过一个大约十五六岁、长着红色长发和蓝色眼睛的女孩。他觉得没必要提及她的穿着。没有人能提供任何线索，真嗣最终断定她不在这片东京-3 的区域。

His mind was starting to scream out at him for letting things escalate to this point. 'AH IF ONLY I HAD JUST ASKED HER NAME YESTERDAY THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED.' Suddenly he remembered the beach yesterday.  
他的内心开始尖叫，责怪自己让事情发展到这个地步。'啊，如果昨天我直接问她的名字，也许就不会发生这种事了。'突然，他想起了昨天的海滩。

'Yes,' he told himself. 'Thats got to be where she is.'  
'没错，'他对自己说，'她一定在那里。'

Running faster than he could remember, with the spare jacket flopping along his shoulders, he managed to get to the beach within the span of minutes. Looking down he couldn't see much, owing to the fact that a mist had settled on the beach. He quickly ran down the steps leading to the beach, and started calling out her name frantically.  
他跑得比记忆中任何时候都快，备用夹克在肩上拍打着，几分钟内就赶到了海滩。低头一看，由于雾气笼罩，几乎看不清什么。他迅速跑下通往海滩的台阶，开始疯狂地呼喊她的名字。

'Damn it, she better be here,' he thought.  
“该死，她最好在这里，”他心想。

This mist was so hard to see, that several times had tripped over wooden logs that had been washed up onto the beach. Suddenly, he tripped over something that was rather large and heavy. Falling to the ground he reached over and felt that it was a bag of some sort. 'Asuka's bag?'  
这雾气如此浓重，以至于好几次他都被冲上沙滩的木头绊倒。突然，他被一个又大又重的东西绊倒了。摔倒在地，他伸手一摸，发现那是一个包。“明日香的包？”

Suddenly he yelled out, "Asuka where are you!?"  
突然，他大喊道：“明日香，你在哪儿！？”

At first, all he could hear was his own voice returning to him on the wind, but then he thought he heard a reply from somewhere off to his right. Scooping up her bag, he ran in the direction of the voice only to trip over something much more squishy and heard a small yelp of surprise. He realized that he had fallen on top of her but didn't care about the position when he heard her voice.  
起初，他只能听到自己的声音随风回荡，但随后他似乎听到右边某个地方传来了回应。他抓起她的包，朝着声音的方向跑去，却不料绊倒在一个软绵绵的东西上，听到了一声小小的惊呼。他意识到自己压在了她身上，但听到她的声音时，他并不在乎这个姿势。

"Idiot, what are you doing out here in the freezing cold."  
“笨蛋，这么冷的天你在外面干什么。”

The mist cleared and he saw that he was a few inches away from her face.  
雾气散去，他发现自己离她的脸只有几英寸远。

"...Asuka," he said weakly.  
"...明日香," 他虚弱地说道。

She frowned up at him, and sighed. "How long do you plan on lying on top of me."  
她皱着眉头看向他，叹了口气。"你打算在我身上躺多久？"

"Ah, no...this is," muttered Shinji.  
“啊，不……这是，”真嗣喃喃道。

He pushed himself off of her, and saw that she had gotten up also. His face opened up into his first blush as he saw that the rain had made her tang-top see through. It clung to her body like a fly clung to fly paper and Shinji had to tear his gaze away from her.  
他推开她，发现她也站了起来。看到雨水让她的短上衣变得透明，紧贴在身上如同苍蝇粘在苍蝇纸上，真嗣的脸颊泛起了第一抹红晕，不得不移开视线。

"So what do you want?" she asked with a scowl.  
“那你想要什么？”她皱着眉问道。

Shinji looked back at her rather surprised. "Why do you think I'm out here in the freezing rain? It certainly isn't to go for a jog."  
真嗣回头看着她，显得有些惊讶。“你觉得我为什么会在这种冰冷的雨中？当然不是为了去跑步。”

"Real witty," she smirked.  
“真机智，”她微微一笑。

"I was worried about you."  
“我担心你。”

Asuka had to let that flow through her mind before it registered.  
明日香不得不让这些思绪在脑海中流淌，然后才逐渐理解。

"You where worried about me?" she whispered.  
“你担心我？”她低声问道。

"Of course. You just left without a word. Then this storm started up, and you...well weren't wearing much so...and also I well...I mean...your not the most err unattractive girl so...I was a bit well...worried about your well being. What with how you looked and...some guys might have wanted to take advantage of that."  
“当然。你一声不吭就走了。然后这场风暴开始了，而你……嗯，穿得不多，所以……而且我也……我的意思是……你不是那种……呃，不吸引人的女孩，所以……我有点……担心你的安危。考虑到你的样子和……有些家伙可能会想占你便宜。”

Asuka was amazed at what he was referring to.  
明日香对他所指的事情感到惊讶。

"You were scared that I might have been raped?" she whispered.  
“你担心我可能被强奸了？”她低声问道。

"Yeah," he mumbled. “嗯，”他含糊地应道。

She was touched by his chivalrousness but didn't want to admit it.  
她被他的骑士精神所感动，但不想承认这一点。

"Idiot, I can take care of myself." Frowning at him, she continued with, "Thanks though, I guess...or...well...yeah"  
"傻瓜，我自己能照顾好自己。" 她皱着眉头对他说，接着又补充道，"不过，还是谢谢了，我想...或者...嗯...好吧"

It was a little awkward for the two of them. Barely three hours ago they had been looking daggers at each other. Shinji took this moment to hand her her bag and also give her the spare coat.  
对他们两人来说，这有点尴尬。仅仅三个小时前，他们还彼此怒目而视。真嗣趁这个机会递给她她的包，还把备用外套给了她。

She looked at him, surprised at the thoughtfulness of this and took it without question. Though when she put it on she started shivering worse than ever.  
她惊讶于他的体贴，毫不犹豫地接过那件衣物。然而，当她穿上后，却开始比之前颤抖得更厉害。

"Is something wrong," he asked?  
“有什么不对劲吗？”他问道。

"Of course idiot, this thing is soaking wet. I felt better without it."  
“当然，傻瓜，这东西湿透了。不穿还好些。”

"Well, then take mine. It's warmer."  
"那好吧，用我的。我的更暖和。"

"With your body touching it, not a chance."  
"你那身体贴着它，别想了。"

"Oh just deal with it Asuka. Your freezing cold."  
"哎，别抱怨了，明日香。你冷得要命。"

"Fine," she snapped at him.  
"好吧，"她厉声对他说。

They both looked at the ground for a while before Shinji said, "Come on lets go back. Misato's worried sick about you."  
他们俩都盯着地面好一会儿，然后真嗣说："走吧，我们回去。美里担心得要命。"

"No, I still don't want to live in the same house as you."  
"不，我还是不想和你住在同一个屋檐下。"

"What, you have another place to go, or where you planning to sleep outside?"  
"怎么，你有别的地方可去，还是打算露宿街头？"

Asuka flushed angrily at what he said about her not having a place to sleep. "Anythings better than having to share an apartment with you, idiot."  
听到他说她无处可睡，明日香气得脸红。"总比和你这个白痴共住一个公寓强。"

"Fine then," sighed Shinji. "Have fun spending the night under a cardboard box."  
"好吧，"真嗣叹了口气。"祝你睡纸箱愉快。"

He turned to leave but felt her grab onto his wrist. He smiled slightly, 'Hmph figures.'  
他转身欲走，却感觉她抓住了他的手腕。他微微一笑，'哼，意料之中。'

She spun him around with surprising force and gave him something reminiscent of a smile. "Fine, you win, idiot. I'll stay at Misato's place until I find a proper place to stay. However," and here her tone turned deathly cold. "If I ever catch you sneaking into my room in the middle of the night, or peeking at me in the shower, I'll be sure to kick you so hard in the balls you'll have to have them surgically removed out of your ass."  
她以惊人的力量将他转过身来，给了他一个类似微笑的表情。"好吧，你赢了，傻瓜。我会暂时住在美里那里，直到找到合适的地方。不过，"说到这里，她的语气变得极其冰冷。"如果我再发现你半夜溜进我房间，或者偷看我洗澡，我一定会狠狠踢你的蛋蛋，让你不得不从屁股里做手术取出来。"

She walked past him, but not before giving him a light jab on his shoulder. 'What did I just do,' asked Shinji to himself? 'I actually convinced her to stay. I must be loosing my mind. I won't last till sunrise.'  
她从他身边走过，临走前轻轻戳了一下他的肩膀。'我刚才做了什么？' 真嗣自问。'我居然说服她留下来了。我一定是疯了。我撑不到天亮了。'

---

Asuka arrived back at Misato's apartment a little ahead of Shinji. Shinji hadn't wanted to give her an excuse to start physically abusing him again and walked several paces behind her.  
明日香比真嗣早一步回到了美里小姐的公寓。真嗣不想给她再次动手打自己的借口，于是故意落后她几步。

When Asuka walked back into Misato's apartment Misato threw her arms around Asuka and gave her a big hug. Shinji arrived back in time to see this and had to suppress a grin. 'Maybe it wont be so bad. Having her stay here.'  
当明日香走进美里小姐的公寓时，美里张开双臂给了她一个大大的拥抱。真嗣刚好赶到，看到这一幕，忍不住想笑。'也许她住在这里不会太糟糕。'

Misato let go of Asuka and now walked over to Shinji and gave him the same big hug. Shinji felt that his back was about ready to split in two. He looked over Misato's shoulder and saw that Asuka was laughing at him silently. The difference it brought to her features was astounding. Where before their had been moody, angry German girl, their now stood someone who seemed rather friendly, Shinji smirked at her slightly. Seeing this Asuka stopped laughing and gave him a scowl before she walked past them, to her room and slammed the sliding door to a close only to have it bounce back open.  
美里放开明日香，走向真嗣，同样给了他一个大大的拥抱。真嗣感觉自己的背快要被压断了。他透过美里的肩膀看到明日香在无声地嘲笑他。她的表情变化令人惊叹。之前还是个阴沉、愤怒的德国女孩，现在却显得相当友好。真嗣微微对她笑了笑。看到这一幕，明日香停止了笑声，瞪了他一眼，然后走过他们，回到自己的房间，用力拉上推拉门，结果门又弹了回来，敞开着。

"DAMN JAPANESE DOORS! CAN'T I EVEN GET SOME PRIVACY!? I'M GONNA NEED TO GET A LOCK ON THIS THING TO KEEP THAT IDIOT OUT!"  
"该死的日本门！我连一点隐私都得不到吗？！我得在这东西上装个锁，把那个白痴挡在外面！"

Shinji just laughed at her outburst and walked to his own room feeling suddenly tired. Flopping down on his own futon he couldn't help but feel slightly happy that he would be living together with Asuka. Rolling over onto his side he turned of his SDAT and fell asleep.  
真嗣只是对她的大喊大笑，然后走向自己的房间，突然感到疲惫。他扑倒在榻榻米上，忍不住感到一丝高兴，因为他将与明日香同住。翻身侧躺，他关掉了 SDAT，沉沉睡去。

### Chapter 2: The Chosen Child  
第二章：被选中的孩子  

**Posting Chapter 2 along with chapter 1. Its just how I do things. Get a nice long stream of chapters and post them together. Well I've also got another story going at the same time and that one currently takes precedence over this one. So don't expect to see this update as much as I (or you) would like it.  
与第一章一起发布第二章。我就是这么做事的。先写好一长串章节，然后一起发布。另外，我还有另一部作品同时在进行，目前那部作品优先级更高。所以别指望这部作品会像我（或你）希望的那样频繁更新。**

---

Touji and Kensuke were sitting at their desks waiting for class to start, and talking about none other than Asuka.  
当真和健介坐在他们的课桌旁，等待上课开始，谈论的正是明日香。

"I can't believe that we get a girl as hot as she is, and to think she's foreign. Just thinking about her gets me rigid," said Touji.  
"真不敢相信我们能遇到像她这么火辣的女孩，而且还是个外国人。光是想到她，我就硬了，" 东治说道。

Kensuke just nodded his consent aware that the same thing happened every time she walked by him. "I brought my best camera today just incase in case I was able to get a view up her skirt."  
真嗣只是点头表示同意，他知道每次她从他身边走过时，同样的事情都会发生。"我今天带了我最好的相机，以防万一我能拍到她的裙底风光。"

Touji turned to his friend, grabbed him by the shoulders and said, "If you do be sure to give a copy to me. That's gonna be some of the best jerk off material that we can get our hands on."  
东治转向他的朋友，抓住他的肩膀说："如果你拍到了，一定要给我一份。那将成为我们能弄到的最棒的打飞机素材。"

"What kind of underwear do you think she wears," asked Kensuke.  
“你觉得她会穿什么样的内衣？” 真嗣问道。

"With luck a silky red thong with matching bra if were lucky," replied Touji as he was fantasizing about it.  
“希望是红色丝质丁字裤配同款胸罩，如果运气好的话，” 东治一边回答一边幻想着。

Just then the two of them were brought out of their discussion by loud voices coming from the hall way.  
就在这时，走廊传来的嘈杂声打断了他们的讨论。

"What the fuck do mean you let Misato make our lunches for us today. You know how bad of a cook she is right?"  
“你他妈什么意思，让美里今天给我们做午饭？你知道她厨艺有多糟糕吧？”

Touji and Kensuke heard a loud audible sigh, then a response, "Hai Asuka, but I was to tired from last night to bother making anything," came Shinji's voice  
听到一声明显的叹息后，传来真嗣的声音：“嗨，明日香，但我昨晚太累了，懒得做任何东西。”

Kensuke and Touji's eyes widened in fear. 'Since when were Asuka and Shinji on a first name basis. 'And what the fuck did Shinji mean when he was to tired from last night. Surely they didn't have sex.'  
"健介和透治的眼睛因恐惧而睁大。‘明日香和真嗣什么时候开始直呼其名了？’‘还有真嗣说的昨晚太累是什么意思？他们该不会是……’”

The classroom door was then thrown open and in stepped the familiar German red head who every male had recently had thoughts about in their showers at home.  
教室的门突然被猛地推开，随即走进来的是那位熟悉的德国红发女孩，最近每个男生在家洗澡时都会想起她。

"Shinji no baka, how the fuck do expect me to eat the shit called food that Misato makes."  
“真嗣你个笨蛋，你他妈怎么指望我吃美里做的那堆狗屎一样的食物。”

"Then just eat the school food," said Shinji starting to get annoyed.  
“那就吃学校的食物吧，”真嗣开始感到不耐烦地说。

Asuka wheeled around and grabbed him by the shirt before yelling at him, "That shits almost as worse as Misato's cooking. I'd rather starve then eat it."  
明日香猛地转身，一把抓住他的衬衫，冲他吼道：“那玩意儿简直和美里做的饭一样糟糕。我宁愿饿死也不吃。”

"THEN STARVE," yelled Shinji back at her finally losing his patience.  
“那就饿死吧！”真嗣朝她吼回去，终于失去了耐心。

Asuka was surprised at his outburst. She always got what she wanted and she wasn't about to let him make a fool of herself in class. Drawing back her hand she intended to slap him with everything she had but he caught her hand as it was brought up to his face. She was now frozen in silent disbelief. 'This weak ass coward has the nerve to touch me. Well, he won't be standing much longer.' Now she brought up her knee and intended to knee him in the balls but she was frozen when she heard his comment.  
明日香对他的爆发感到惊讶。她总是能得到她想要的，绝不允许他在班上让自己出丑。她收回手，打算用尽全力扇他一巴掌，但他的手在她抬手到脸前时抓住了她。她现在僵住了，无声地难以置信。“这个懦弱的胆小鬼居然敢碰我。哼，他站不了多久了。”她抬起膝盖，打算用膝盖顶他的下体，但听到他的话时她僵住了。

"Incase you haven't realized Asuka their is only a certain amount of shit that I can take before I get pissed off and let it all out. So if you ever want to see the angry side of me continue to do what your doing. I've got enough hate built up over the span of my life, and wouldn't mind sending it all in your direction."  
“如果你还没意识到的话，我告诉你，明日香，我忍耐的极限是有限的，一旦超过我就会爆发。所以如果你想见识我生气的样子，就继续做你现在做的事。我这一生积累了足够的恨意，不介意全部发泄在你身上。”

Shinji let go of her hand and walked over to his desk, only realizing now that their fight was witnessed by the whole class. 'Maybe they'll think twice before talking behind my back.'  
真嗣松开了她的手，走到自己的桌前，这时才意识到他们的争吵被全班同学看到了。“也许他们以后在背后议论我之前会三思。”

Every male in the class was now looking at Shinji with absolute loathing. "Where the hell does he get off yelling at Asuka like that," said somebody whispering to their friend.  
班上所有的男生现在都用绝对厌恶的眼神看着真嗣。“他到底凭什么那样对明日香大吼大叫，”有人低声对朋友说。

"It looks like Asuka is in shock over what happened."  
"看起来明日香对刚才发生的事感到震惊。"

"Well, can't blame her, she's a new student and she now knows how much of an ass Shinji is."  
"嗯，也不能怪她，她是个新生，现在知道了真嗣有多混蛋。"

Asuka stood their for several minutes still looking straight ahead. This was the first time that she had ever been yelled at like that before, not even her step mother who she loathed. Getting control of herself she walked over to her desk, ignoring the fact that Shinji was behind her, and sat down.  
明日香站在那里好几分钟，依旧直视前方。这是她第一次被人那样吼，就连她讨厌的继母也没有过。她控制住自己，走到桌前，无视身后的真嗣，坐了下来。

Most of the class continued to stare at the two of them, though they were both staring off into space completely unaware of the stares they were getting.  
班上大部分同学继续盯着他们俩，尽管他们俩都茫然地望着远方，完全没有意识到自己正被人盯着。

---

During lunch Shinji was starting to have regrets about blowing up in Asuka's face. But she really was so damn bitchy sometimes. He thought that after last night they could have gotten along fairly well but that morning wasn't very fun.  
午餐时，真嗣开始后悔对明日香发火。但她有时候真的太刻薄了。他原以为经过昨晚他们能相处得不错，但今早并不愉快。

Shinji had woken up to his alarm going off and saw that he had almost no time to get ready. He had taken a quick shower tossed on some clothes and ran into the kitchen only to find Asuka sitting their tapping her finger on the table.  
真嗣被闹钟吵醒，发现自己几乎没有时间准备。他匆匆洗了个澡，套上衣服，冲进厨房，却发现明日香坐在那里，用手指敲打着桌子。

She had given him a sour look and just said food. Shinji had raised his eyebrows at this point and had asked why she didn't make it herself. He remembered that this was the start of one of her bitchy moods again. She had said that since Misato was such a lousy cook then it was his job to cook for her every morning before school and every afternoon when they came home.  
她给了他一个酸溜溜的眼神，只说了句“食物”。此时，真嗣挑了挑眉，问她为什么不自己动手。他记得这标志着她又一次进入了那种刻薄的情绪。她声称，既然美里是个糟糕的厨师，那么每天早上上学前和下午回家后，为他准备饭菜就成了他的职责。

Shinji had refused at first but then after receiving a sharp blow to the face he gave in and cooked her something that he had never tried since she didn't seem to like Japanese food. All in all he thought that his first attempt at a German breakfast was rather decent. Even Asuka seemed to think the sauerkraut was good, though she didn't mention anything of it.  
起初，真嗣拒绝了，但在脸上挨了一记重击后，他妥协了，为她做了些自己从未尝试过的东西，因为她似乎不喜欢日本料理。总的来说，他认为自己第一次尝试做德国早餐还算不错。就连明日香似乎也觉得酸菜不错，尽管她对此只字未提。

Then though when they were just about to leave Asuka had demanded that he also make lunch for them. Shinji had simply pointed to two sack lunches that were obviously supposed to be for them. Asuka had said that Misato had made those and that their was no way that she was going to touch anything that Misato cooked. Shinji could understand her reasoning, he had already had a bad experience with Misato who didn't even seem to know how to cook rice.  
然而，就在他们即将离开时，明日香要求他也为他们准备午餐。真嗣只是指了指两个显然是为他们准备的便当。明日香说那是美里做的，她绝不会碰美里做的任何东西。真嗣能理解她的理由，他之前已经有过一次糟糕的经历，美里甚至连煮饭都不会。

Asuka however had thrown her sack lunch at Shinji's face spilling the contents all over his face and forcing him to take a shower. Which made her even more pissed at him for almost making them late.  
然而，明日香却将她的便当袋扔向了真嗣的脸，里面的东西洒了他一脸，逼得他不得不去洗澡。这让她更加恼火，因为他差点让他们迟到。

Now though as Shinji had his back against railing up on the school roof he was starting to wish that he had just done what she asked. In truth he wanted to be her friend but she just blew off his attempts to make conversation when yesterday she had practically tried to seduce him. Though if he had done anything he assumed she would have kicked him in the balls. Suddenly he heard the opening and closing of a door and looked around to see two of his class mates, Touji and Kensuke. Touji was standing their rather threatening cracking his knuckles while Kensuke was holding his camera up as though preparing to start taking pictures.  
现在，真嗣背靠在学校屋顶的栏杆上，开始后悔没有听她的话。实际上，他很想和她做朋友，但昨天她几乎试图引诱他，而今天却对他的搭话置之不理。尽管如此，如果他真的做了什么，他猜她会一脚踢向他的下体。突然，他听到了开门和关门的声音，转头一看，是他的两个同学，东治和健介。东治站在那里，威胁性地活动着手指，而健介则举着相机，似乎准备开始拍照。

Shinji raised an eyebrow up at them and asked, "What do you two want."  
真嗣对他们挑了挑眉，问道：“你们两个想要什么？”

Touji's response was a mean right hook to the side of Shinji's face.  
冬二回敬的是一记狠辣的右勾拳，直击真嗣的脸颊。

Shinji was caught unaware and went flying to the concrete landing hard and reopening his cut that he had received when Misato almost ran him over. Feeling a steady pain in his arm and something warm trickling down and dripping down on the ground he looked up only to be greeted by another punch of Touji's.  
真嗣毫无防备，被击飞到水泥地上，重重摔落，之前被美里差点撞到时留下的伤口再次裂开。他感到手臂持续疼痛，有温热的液体缓缓流下，滴落在地。抬头一看，迎接他的却是冬二的又一拳。

This next one dazed him slightly as he saw white spots in front of him. Wiping a trickle of blood that had appeared at the side of his mouth he heard Touji say, "You little shit. What the fuck where you harassing Asuka for this morning."  
这一拳让他有些晕眩，眼前出现了白点。他擦去嘴角渗出的一丝血迹，听到冬二说道：“你这个小混蛋，早上干嘛骚扰明日香？”

Shinji would have loved to retort that she had it coming but felt like his head was going to split open any moment. It didn't help that Kensuke had now started taking pictures and was making his vision fade and turn blurry. Shinji then felt a sharp jab to his stomach and felt all the wind knocked out of him including his lunch. Wiping his mouth again which now tasted like blood and bile he looked up again to see Touji looking down on him, disgust all over his face.  
真嗣本想反驳说她自找的，但感觉自己的头随时都要裂开似的。更糟糕的是，健介现在开始拍照，让他的视线变得模糊不清。接着，真嗣感到腹部一阵剧痛，仿佛所有的空气连同午餐都被击飞了。他再次擦了擦嘴，现在嘴里满是血和胆汁的味道。他抬头一看，只见东治俯视着他，满脸的厌恶。

Touji then picked him up by the collar of his shirt and gave him a final warning, "If I ever see you yelling at Asuka again I'll make sure that you lose more than just your lunch."  
东治随后揪住他的衣领将他提起，给了他最后的警告：“如果我再看到你对明日香大喊大叫，我保证你失去的不仅仅是午餐。”

Looking up slowly at the jocks face Shinji smirked with what remained of his consciences and said, "If you were living with the redheaded bitch then you wouldn't be so inclined to hitting me." Upon saying this Shinji felt a blow to the front of his face and felt his nose breaking spewing blood everywhere before he passed out.  
真嗣缓缓抬头看着东治的脸，用仅存的意识冷笑道：“如果你和那个红发婊子住在一起，你就不会这么想打我了。”话音刚落，真嗣感到脸上重重一击，鼻子断裂，鲜血四溅，随后便失去了意识。

---

The first thing Shinji realized when he was conscious again was that someone had woken him up with a light pound on the top of his head. The second thing he realized was that his whole head was on fire. Touching the side of his face he felt a sticky sensation and pulled his hand away to see crimson blood on his hand. Remembering what had happened he put his had up to his nose and felt that it had been bent into a weird angle. Wincing slightly at how it felt he now moved his tongue around in his mouth to see if any teeth had been knocked loose. Not finding any he spit on the ground expecting to see blood but only seeing white saliva.  
当真嗣再次恢复意识时，他首先意识到的是有人用轻轻一击唤醒了他。接着，他意识到整个头部如同着火一般剧痛。他触摸脸颊，感觉到一种粘稠的感觉，抽回手时，手上沾满了鲜红的血。回想起发生的事情，他将手伸向鼻子，感觉到鼻梁已经扭曲成了一个奇怪的角度。微微皱眉，感受着这种不适，他开始在嘴里转动舌头，检查是否有牙齿松动。没有发现松动的牙齿，他吐了一口在地上，期待看到血迹，却只看到了白色的唾液。

"Thats disgusting," a voice in front of him said. "By the way you look like shit."  
“真恶心，”一个声音在他面前说道，“顺便说一句，你看起来糟透了。”

Shinji looked up and was surprised to see Asuka standing over him with a frown on her face. A mixture of emotions surged through Shinji including, loathing, spite, self hatred, and for some reason longing. How the hell he could still like her even with this being partially her fault for him ending up in this mess, he didn't know. Though now that he looked at her face more closely he thought he saw something else hidden behind that frown of hers, worry. Even so Shinji didn't want to have her laughing in his face so he rudely said, "What do you want?"  
真嗣抬头一看，惊讶地发现明日香正皱着眉头站在他面前。一股复杂的情绪涌上心头，包括厌恶、怨恨、自我憎恨，还有不知为何的渴望。他不知道自己怎么还能喜欢她，尽管这一切在某种程度上也是她的错，让他陷入这种困境。不过，现在仔细看她的脸，他觉得在那皱眉背后还隐藏着别的情绪，是担忧。即便如此，真嗣不想让她嘲笑自己，于是粗鲁地问道：“你想干嘛？”

Asuka was surprised at this tone of voice and said, "Nothing really, I just decided to skip class and was wandering around when I saw you passed out up here. What happened anyway."  
明日香对这种语气感到惊讶，说道：“没什么，我只是决定逃课，四处闲逛时看到你在这里昏倒了。到底发生了什么？”

Now Shinji could definitely detect the worry in her voice. "Why do you care? I figured seeing me like this would make you happy."  
现在真嗣可以肯定她的声音里带着担忧。“你为什么关心？我以为看到我这样你会高兴。”

This brought a sour look to Asuka's, "Asshole, why would I be happy about something like this."  
这让明日香露出了厌恶的表情，“混蛋，我怎么可能为这种事高兴。”

'And yet you seem to enjoy hitting me every chance you get,' thought Shinji. Giving her a final look he sighed and said, "Touji, that big dumb jock felt like fucking up my face after our little argument this morning."  
“尽管如此，你似乎每次有机会都要打我一顿，”真嗣心想。他最后看了她一眼，叹了口气说，“东治，那个大块头傻瓜，今天早上我们吵了一架后，他就想把我的脸打烂。”

Asuka starred back at him in surprise, "You mean that baka did this to you just because you yelled at me."  
明日香惊讶地回望着他，“你是说那个笨蛋就因为你对我吼了一声就把你打成这样？”

"Surprised? Expected for him to kick the shit out of me even more, I assume."  
"惊讶吗？我猜你以为他会把我打得屁滚尿流吧。"

Asuka looked back at him annoyed, "Why the hell do you think I'm enjoying this. It sickens me really."  
明日香回头恼怒地看着他，"为什么你他妈会觉得我喜欢这个。这真的让我恶心。"

"Hmph," was all Shinji managed to say.  
"哼，" 真嗣只能说出这么一句。

Suddenly he felt something soft hit his face and looked up to see a white rag hanging over the side of his head. Looking over in Asuka's direction he saw that she was watching him expectingly.  
突然，他感到有什么柔软的东西打在了脸上，抬头一看，发现一块白布挂在了他的头侧。他朝明日香的方向看去，只见她正期待地看着他。

"Thats to clean yourself off with. Now get a move on. I feel like vomiting from all that blood."  
“那是用来擦干净自己的。现在快点行动。我因为那些血感到想吐。”

Shinji nodded his consent and proceeded to wipe as much of the blood off of his face as he could. His white shirt was ruined though, the blood had already stained it.  
真嗣点头同意，开始尽可能地擦掉脸上的血迹。不过他的白衬衫已经毁了，血迹已经渗了进去。

"Why are you being nice to me all the sudden anyway, Asuka?"  
“为什么你突然对我这么好，明日香？”

Asuka who had had her back turned to him now wheeled around and said, "Don't get any ideas. I just feel like this is a good way for me to repay you for what you did last night. Also...I...feel that some of this...is well, my fault."  
背对着他的明日香转过身来，说道：“别多想。我只是觉得这样能回报你昨晚做的事。而且……我……觉得有些事情……嗯，是我的错。”

Shinji thought that his brain had shut down momentarily and he had miss heard what she just said. "Asuka, well, umm thanks. But this is more my fault. I was the one that got angry and yelled at you. Also, while Touji was hitting me, I kind of said somethings not so nice about you. I regret saying those now, it was more of the heat of the moment and I was still angry with you."  
真嗣觉得自己的大脑可能暂时关闭了，他怀疑自己听错了她的话。“明日香，嗯，谢谢。但这更多是我的错。是我生气了，对你大喊大叫。而且，当东治打我的时候，我好像说了一些不太好听的话。我现在后悔说了那些，那只是当时情绪激动，我还在生你的气。”

"Baka Shinji..." "笨蛋真嗣..."

Shinji continued to wipe the blood of his face while Asuka leaned over the railing and watched down town Tokyo-3. Shinji was surprised however when she crouched down next to him and frowned at his face. "You missed a spot by the way, bottom left lip."  
真嗣继续擦拭着脸上的血迹，而明日香则倚在栏杆上，俯视着东京-3 的市区。然而，当她蹲在他身边，皱着眉头看他的脸时，真嗣感到惊讶。“顺便说一句，你漏了一块，左下唇。”

Shinji hastily whipped the corner of his mouth, "Gone now?"  
真嗣急忙擦了擦嘴角，“现在干净了吗？”

Asuka laughed which again seemed to change the way she looked. "Yeah, you look a lot better."  
明日香笑了，这笑容似乎又改变了她的模样。“是啊，你看起来好多了。”

Now they stood their hanging over the railing looking at downtown Tokyo-3.  
现在他们站在那里，俯瞰着东京-3 的市中心。

"Hey Asuka how come you decided to skip class. Surely it wasn't to look for me."  
“嘿，明日香，你怎么决定逃课了？肯定不是为了找我吧。”

"What you baka. Of course not. I've already learned everything you guys are covering. Don't forget I graduated from a university at the age of fourteen. I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for...certain reasons."  
"你这个笨蛋。当然不是。我已经学完了你们正在学的一切。别忘了我十四岁就大学毕业了。如果不是因为...某些原因，我根本不会在这里。"

Shinji would have liked to know what those certain reasons but knew better than to ask. Suddenly he was pulled away from his thoughts when he saw Asuka reaching into the pocket of her blouse to pull out her phone.  
真嗣很想知道那些特定原因是什么，但他知道最好不要问。突然，他的思绪被拉了回来，因为他看到明日香把手伸进她的衬衫口袋里拿手机。

"Hai, yes I'm at school...I'll tell you later...NO!...You want me to come in?...Another one...hai, hai, I'll head their right now...OK see you soon." With that she hung up the phone and turned to Shinji. "Sorry baka but I've got some things that I've got take care of so I got to go. Though I expect you to have dinner cooked for me when I get home."  
"嗨，是的，我在学校...我稍后告诉你...不！...你想让我进去吗？...又一个...嗨，嗨，我马上过去...好的，待会儿见。" 说完，她挂了电话，转向真嗣。"抱歉，笨蛋，但我有些事情要处理，所以我得走了。不过我希望我回家时你已经把晚饭做好了。"

"Err what time will that be."  
"呃，那会是什么时候？"

Asuka knew that it could be anytime from now till the next day but just said sometime after six, hopefully.  
明日香知道这可能从现在到明天任何时候，但还是说大概六点后，希望如此。

"OK I'll have it ready when you get back. And Misato should be back around the same time to."  
"好的，你回来时我会准备好的。还有美里应该也差不多同一时间回来。"

Asuka didn't want to let on how close he was, just nodded and said that she would see him later that night.  
明日香不想透露自己有多接近他，只是点点头说晚上会再见他。

---

'Hmm I wonder what Asuka will want for dinner. She hates everything we Japanese eat so...I could go online I suppose and find something that she might like. Then again I think I read somewhere about something called Jagerschnitzel...err what did it include again.'  
'嗯，不知道明日香晚餐想吃什么。她讨厌我们日本人吃的一切……或许我可以上网找些她可能喜欢的东西。不过，我记得在某处读到过一种叫炸肉排的东西……呃，它包含什么来着？'

Suddenly Shinji was brought out of his train of thought when an announcement boomed through all of Tokyo-3. "The JSSDF has announced that Tokyo-3 will be going into lock down. All citizens will please head to the nearest shelter. I repeat all citizens will you please head to the nearest shelter. That is all."  
突然，真嗣的思绪被东京-3 全境的广播打断。"东京-3 特别防卫队宣布，东京-3 将进入封锁状态。请所有市民前往最近的避难所。重复一遍，请所有市民前往最近的避难所。完毕。"

Shinji stood their in shock, "Wonderful, what the hell could have happened that is sending all of Tokyo-3 into disarray." Not wanting to wait for something to happen Shinji quickly followed the now flashing signs that had popped up on street corners showing him the direction of the shelters.  
真嗣站在那里震惊不已，心想：“太好了，到底发生了什么鬼事情，让整个第三新东京市陷入混乱。”不想坐等事态发展，真嗣迅速跟随那些突然出现在街角的闪烁指示牌，指示着他前往避难所的方向。

Half way to the nearest shelter he stopped and thought, 'Wait what about Asuka...she'll be okay right. She heard the alarm.'  
在前往最近避难所的半路上，他停下脚步思索，‘等等，那明日香怎么办...她应该没事吧。她听到了警报。’

Running a little faster now he sped up and was soon in front of the shelter when he stopped again. 'But wait what if she is somewhere where she can't get to a shelter. Ahh why the hell am I even worrying about her. Its not like she ever showed any emotion to me.' Not true said a small voice in the back of Shinji's head. 'She obviously was worried about your condition earlier.'  
现在他跑得更快了，不久就来到了避难所前，却又再次停下。‘但是，万一她在某个无法到达避难所的地方怎么办。啊，我他妈为什么要担心她。她对我从来没表现出任何情感。’但内心深处一个小小的声音反驳道，‘她显然之前对你的状况很担心。’

'No not possible for her. Worrying about someone else is beneath her.'  
'不，她不可能的。担心别人对她来说是掉价的事。'

'Suit yourself then coward. But remember when you see her corpse, remember that you could have done something to prevent that from happening.'  
'随你便吧，懦夫。但记住，当你看到她的尸体时，记住你本可以做些什么来阻止这一切发生的。'

"GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY MIND," Shinji screamed out loud.  
“滚出我的脑海，”真嗣大声尖叫道。

"Hey kid stop screaming about random shit and get your ass in here."  
“嘿，小子，别再鬼叫那些乱七八糟的东西了，赶紧滚进来。”

Shinji looked up to see a middle aged man with his hand held out beckoning Shinji to get into shelter. "C'mon kid get in here or your gonna die."  
真嗣抬头一看，一个中年男子正伸出手招呼他进入避难所。“快点，小子，进来，不然你就要死了。”

Shinji almost put out his hand to grasp the middle aged man's hand when a small voice echoed in his mind, 'Coward.' It was the voice of Asuka and suddenly Shinji saw her as a corpse with the left side of her face torn away leaving one of her eyes dangling out of its socket. 'Where the hell where you Shinji. Cowering like the rest of them while I was trying to protect all your sorry asses. Your nothing but a coward.'  
真嗣几乎要伸出手去握住那位中年男子的手，这时一个微弱的声音在他脑海中响起：‘懦夫。’那是明日香的声音，突然间，真嗣眼前浮现出她尸体般的模样，左脸被撕裂，一只眼睛悬挂在眼眶外。‘你到底在哪里，真嗣？和其他人一样躲起来，而我却在试图保护你们这些可怜的家伙。你不过是个懦夫。’

'NO IT WASNT MY FAULT,' screamed Shinji in his head.  
'不，那不是我的错！' 真嗣在心里尖叫道。

'Yes it was, you abandoned me. I thought you cared about me. I thought something developed between us during that rainy night.'  
'是的，是你抛弃了我。我以为你关心我。我以为在那雨夜我们之间产生了某种情感。'

'HOW THE HELL, AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT I FEEL FOR YOU IF ALL YOU EVER DO IS YELL AT ME AND PUNCH ME.'  
'我他妈怎么知道我对你的感觉是什么，如果你总是对我大喊大叫还打我！'

'Wise up Shinji and find out what I'm really meaning.' The slowly rotting Asuka in Shinji's mind now put her hand up and slowly stroked the side of Shinji's face. Only now did Shinji see that the ends of some of her fingers were missing and the bones was perturbing out. 'No Asuka don't, I wont let this happen to you.'  
“醒醒吧，真嗣，弄清楚我真正的意思。”在真嗣心中逐渐腐烂的明日香举起手，缓缓抚摸着真嗣的脸颊。直到此刻，真嗣才注意到她的一些手指末端已经缺失，骨头令人不安地露了出来。“不，明日香，不要这样，我不会让你变成这样的。”

'Then you better get your sorry ass up and find me.' With that the Asuka in Shinji's mind gave him a light slap to the face jerking Shinji back to the present.  
“那你最好赶紧振作起来找到我。”话音刚落，真嗣心中的明日香轻轻扇了他一巴掌，将真嗣拉回了现实。

Shinji blinked his eyes slightly and now looked at the person with his hand extended. His appearance had changed and now he looked like a demon beckoning Shinji to hell. "C'mon kid. It will be okay. You'll be safe with us."  
真嗣微微眨了眨眼，现在看着那个伸出手的人。他的外貌变了，现在看起来像是一个召唤真嗣前往地狱的恶魔。“来吧，孩子。一切都会好起来的。跟我们在一起你会安全的。”

Shinji now looked behind him and saw that everyone had glowing red eyes. "No," said Shinji firmly. "I have something that I have to take care of. I wont be a coward anymore. I wont listen to you demons anymore."  
真嗣此刻回头一看，发现每个人的眼睛都闪着红光。“不，”真嗣坚定地说，“我有件必须要处理的事。我不会再当懦夫了。我不会再听你们这些恶魔的话了。”

With that Shinji turned his back on the shelter and walked away.  
说完，真嗣毅然决然地离开了避难所，背对着它走去。

---

Even though Shinji intended to look for Asuka he really had no idea where she was. Worse his noes which was still broken had started to bleed again and his vision was turning foggy again. 'God damn that Touji. If something happens to Asuka while I'm like this I will cut off his head,' he thought savagely.  
尽管真嗣打算去找明日香，但他其实根本不知道她在哪里。更糟糕的是，他那依然骨折的鼻子又开始流血，视线也再次变得模糊。‘该死的东治，如果我这样子的时候明日香出了什么事，我非砍了他的脑袋不可，’他恶狠狠地想。

Shinji suddenly caught his foot on the side walk and fell down hard on his chin. Shinji's teeth cut into his tongue and for a minute he thought that he had bitten his tongue off. Lying down on the side walk he spit and saw dark red in his saliva. 'Great by the time I find her I'll be a walking corpse.' Pushing himself off the ground he looked around. It appeared that he was the only person around still.  
真嗣突然绊倒在人行道上，重重地摔了个嘴啃泥。他的牙齿咬破了舌头，有那么一会儿，他以为自己把舌头咬断了。躺在人行道上，他吐了一口唾沫，看到唾液中带着暗红色。'太好了，等我找到她时，我已经是具行尸走肉了。'他用力撑起身体，环顾四周。看起来，他似乎是周围唯一的人。

'Damn it I've got to find her.' Pushing himself off the ground he suddenly fell back down when the ground start to shake. "What the fu-" was all he managed to say when the streets of Tokyo-3 started to bend and fold away into the ground. Turning around Shinji saw that the many skyscrapers where now being brought underground. Stunned at was happening he turned his head in every direction watching as buildings disappeared around him.  
'该死，我得找到她。'他用力撑起身体，突然地面开始摇晃，他又摔了回去。"搞什么鬼-"他刚开口，东京-3 的街道就开始弯曲折叠，沉入地下。真嗣转过身，看到许多摩天大楼正被带入地下。对眼前发生的一切感到震惊，他四处张望，看着建筑物在他周围消失。

"Shinji, hey Shinji, wake up, I SAID WAKE UP."  
“真嗣，嘿，真嗣，醒醒，我说了醒醒。”

Shinji felt a sharp pain to his already aching head and looked around to see Misato standing their with an anxious look on her face. "Shinji c'mon I've got to take you back to Nerv headquarters."  
真嗣感到本已疼痛的头部又是一阵剧痛，环顾四周，看到美里站在那里，脸上带着焦虑的表情。“真嗣，快点，我得带你回 NERV 总部。”

Shinji starred blankly back at her.  
真嗣茫然地回望着她。

"Shinji get up, you can't stay out here, its not safe."  
“真嗣，起来，你不能待在这里，这不安全。”

He continued to stare back at her.  
他继续盯着她。

"You wanted to help Asuka right?"  
“你想帮助明日香，对吧？”

This brought light to Shinji's eyes and he slowly stood up. "Asuka is at Nerv?"  
这使真嗣的眼睛亮了起来，他缓缓站起身。“明日香在 NERV 吗？”

Misato was afraid of how much she should tell Shinji. "Yes and I'll tell you about everything later, so lets go."  
美里担心自己该告诉真嗣多少。“是的，我稍后会把一切都告诉你，所以我们走吧。”

Shinji simply nodded and jumped into the passenger seat and Misato drove off.  
真嗣只是点点头，跳进了副驾驶座，美里便开车离开了。

---

Ten minutes later Shinji and Misato where on an elevator that was bringing them deep underground. Shinji thought that this was Nerv headquarters but never would have thought that it was directly under his feet. Finally getting control of his voice Shinji asked the question that had been nagging at him for the past ten minutes. 'Misato why are all the buildings of Tokyo-3 going underground? And why has an air raid siren been issued?"  
十分钟后，真嗣和美里在一部电梯里，电梯正将他们带到地下深处。真嗣以为这是 NERV 总部，但从未想过它就在自己脚下。终于控制住自己的声音，真嗣问出了过去十分钟一直困扰他的问题。“美里，为什么东京-3 的所有建筑都在向地下延伸？还有，为什么发布了空袭警报？”

Since Shinji had come this far Misato figured it would be best to answer some of his questions. "An Angel will be here soon and it will try to destroy us. Thats the best explanation I can give you right now, later I'll go into more detail later."  
既然真嗣已经走到了这一步，美里认为最好回答他的一些问题。“使徒很快就会来到这里，它会试图摧毁我们。这是我目前能给你的最好解释，稍后我会详细说明。”

"OK and please tell me, what is Asuka doing here, is it dangerous."  
“好的，请告诉我，明日香在这里做什么，这危险吗？”

Misato was silent for a minute before she said, "Lets just say that when everything is done she'll be glad that your here."  
美里沉默了一会儿，然后说：“这么说吧，当一切结束后，她会很高兴你在这里。”

"What did you mean by an angel anyway."  
"你说的天使到底是什么意思。"

"I told you I can't go into specifics right now, I'll tell you about it later."  
"我告诉过你现在不能细说，晚点再跟你解释。"

Shinji was surprised that Misato had snapped at him and just sat back in his seat and waited. Whatever these angels were they were making Misato panic worse then Shinji had ever seen. "They must be what the air raid is about."  
真嗣对美里突然对他发火感到惊讶，只是坐回座位等待。无论这些天使是什么，它们让美里恐慌的程度超过了真嗣所见过的任何情况。“它们一定是这次空袭的原因。”

Several minutes later Shinji found himself being ushered into something that looked strangely like the great pyramids in Egypt.  
几分钟后，真嗣发现自己被带到了一个看起来奇怪地像埃及大金字塔的地方。

"Misato wha-" "美里，这——"

"Quiet Shinji, I promise I'll explain detail but right now I need to think. Why do I always get lost when its a situation like this."  
"安静，真嗣，我保证会详细解释，但现在我需要思考。为什么每次遇到这种情况我都会迷路。"

"Well, you were always known as a bit of an air head during college," said a voice behind them.  
“嗯，你在大学时总是有点儿头脑简单，”一个声音从他们身后传来。

Misato spun around and saw her old college friend and coworker Ritsuko Akagi standing their smirking at her. "Ritsuko thank God you found me you know I always get lost around here."  
美里转过身，看到她大学时代的老朋友兼同事赤木律子站在那里，正对她露出微笑。“律子，谢天谢地你找到我了，你知道我在这儿总是迷路。”

Ritsuko simply said, "Unit 02 launched moments ago to combat the angel."  
律子只是简单地说：“2 号机刚刚出击，去对抗使徒了。”

Misato's smile fell at this bit of news. "OK I'll proceeded to the command center to take control of operations. She turned to leave but Ritsuko caught her hand, "Who's the kid," she said pointing to Shinji?  
听到这个消息，美里微笑消失了。“好的，我会前往指挥中心接管行动。”她转身要走，但律子抓住了她的手，“这孩子是谁？”她指着真嗣问道？

"Oh...well, this is the commanders son, Shinji Ikari."  
“哦……嗯，这是指挥官的儿子，碇真嗣。”

Ritsuko's eyes widened at this. "I thought the commander told you that under no circumstances were you supposed to bring him to headquarters."  
律子听到这话，眼睛睁大了。“我记得指挥官告诉过你，无论如何都不能把他带到总部来。”

"I know but Asuk...well, I found him in the middle of the street while the buildings were retracting underground. I couldn't just leave him out in the open. Also he seemed rather distressed."  
"我知道，但明日香...嗯，我在建筑物正在缩回地下的街道中央发现了他。我不能就这样把他丢在外面。而且他看起来相当不安。"

Ritsuko gave Misato a funny look before turning around and saying, "Fine but this is on your head and I have nothing to do with this. Just don't let anything happen to Unit 02."  
律子给了美里一个奇怪的表情，然后转过身说："好吧，但这事你自己负责，我可不掺和。只是别让零二号机出什么事。"

Misato looked at the back of her friend for a few seconds before turning to Shinji, grabbing his wrist and steering him in the correct direction.  
美里盯着她朋友的背影几秒钟，然后转向真嗣，抓住他的手腕，引导他走向正确的方向。

---

Shinji soon found himself in a wide room filled with computers and personal at each computer. In front of him was a massive screen that showed many different parts of Tokyo-3. He turned to ask Misato a question but saw that she was now issuing order to everyone  
不久，真嗣发现自己身处一个宽敞的房间，每台电脑前都坐着人。他面前是一块巨大的屏幕，显示着东京-3 的多个不同区域。他转身想向美里提问，却看到她正在向众人下达指令。

"What's the status of Unit 02?"  
“二号机的状态如何？”

"Pilots heart rate is seventy heart beats per minute. Sync rate is at a steady sixty-three with no signs of dropping. Umbilical cable is still attached."  
“驾驶员心率每分钟七十次。同步率稳定在六十三，没有下降迹象。脐带电缆仍连接着。”

"What about the angel...what are we calling this one?"  
"关于那个天使...我们怎么称呼这个？"

"Sachiel ma'am." "萨基尔女士。"

"Very well, what is the status of Sachiel."  
"很好，萨基尔的状况如何？"

"Computers show that its currently off the coast of Tokyo-3."  
"计算机显示它目前位于第三新东京市海岸外。"

"We are certain its an angel correct."  
"我们确定那是使徒，对吧。"

"Hai, pattern blue has been confirmed."  
"是的，已确认是蓝色模式。"

"OK, send up the rifles for Unit 02. Unit 02 will attack and destroy the enemy. What about Unit 00 by the way, has Rei recuperated enough yet to pilot it yet?"  
"好的，让 02 号单位准备好步枪。02 号单位将发起攻击并摧毁敌人。顺便问一下，00 号单位的情况如何，绫波恢复到可以驾驶了吗？"

"As for as I know no. Her right arm is still broken so she is not able to pilot it."  
"据我所知还不行。她的右臂仍然骨折，所以她还不能驾驶。"

"Very well...put Unit 01 on standby."  
"很好……让 01 号单位待命。"

Everyone looked at her. "Unit 01, I thought it was on an indefinite freeze?"  
所有人都看着她。“初号机，我以为它被无限期冻结了？”

"If we have to we will unfreeze it."  
“如果有必要，我们会解冻它。”

"What about the pilot?" “那驾驶员呢？”

Misato ignored the question and turned to the overhead screen. "Unit 02 I want you to engage the enemy away from Tokyo-3 attack it while its still off the coast."  
美里无视了这个问题，转向头顶的屏幕。“二号机，我要求你将敌人引离第三新东京市，趁它还在海岸线外时攻击它。”

"Hai," came a familiar voice over the speakers which Shinji recognized immediately.  
“明白，”扬声器中传来一个熟悉的声音，真嗣立刻就认了出来。

"As-u-ka?" “明日香？”

Misato heard him and looked around to see him starring at the screen in horror. Unit 02 was currently displayed on the screen fighting the angel. Unit 02 was painting in a bright red color which was to Asuka's liking. In its hand was a rifle which was currently zoomed in on the slowly approaching angel.  
美里听到他的声音，环顾四周，看到他正惊恐地盯着屏幕。屏幕上显示着 02 号机正在与使徒战斗。02 号机涂着鲜艳的红色，这正合明日香的心意。它手中握着一把步枪，目前正对准缓缓逼近的使徒进行瞄准。

"Asuka," said Shinji a little louder this time.  
“明日香，”真嗣这次稍微提高了声音说道。

Misato turned quickly to face him but to late. Shinji had darted to the nearest computer and wrapped his arms around the neck of the person stationed their, and pulled him backwards out of his chair. Standing over the microphone panting slightly he yelled into the microphone, "ASUKA WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF IN DANGER."  
美里迅速转身面对他，但为时已晚。真嗣已经冲到最近的电脑前，用双臂勒住坐在那里的人的脖子，将他向后拉出椅子。他站在麦克风前，微微喘息着，对着麦克风大喊：“明日香，你为什么要这样做？你不必让自己置身险境。”

Whether she heard him or not she gave no reply. Shinji was about to yell into again when he felt someone grab his wrist and drag him backwards before hitting him in the side of the face.  
无论她是否听到，她都没有回应。真嗣正要再次大喊时，突然感到有人抓住他的手腕，将他向后拖去，随后一拳打在他的脸颊上。

Shinji wasn't sure what number that made it today but he felt that his brain had finally popped loose and was floating freely in his head. Looking up slightly dazed he saw an angry Misato standing over him.  
真嗣不确定今天这是第几次了，但他感觉自己的脑子终于松动了，正自由地漂浮在脑袋里。他有些恍惚地抬头，看到愤怒的美里站在他面前。

"What do you think your doing," she hissed at him. "Under no circumstances are we allowed to bother the pilots while their in combat. I took you here knowing what charges I would face. Asuka however begged me to find you and make sure you were all right. And now you go pulling a stunt like this and-"  
“你以为你在做什么？”她低声呵斥他，“在任何情况下，我们都不允许在驾驶员战斗时打扰他们。我带你来这里，明知会面临什么指控。然而，明日香却恳求我找到你，确保你没事。现在你却做出这种事——”

Suddenly she was interrupted by one of the computer operators. "Unit 02's sync rate has dropped down to fifty-seven, fifty-six...still dropping."  
突然，一名电脑操作员打断了她。“二号机的同步率已经下降到五十七，五十六……还在继续下降。”

Misato cursed. "Keep monitoring her sync rate and heart rate let me know instantly if anything happens. What's the status on Unit 01?"  
美里咒骂了一声。“继续监控她的同步率和心率，一旦有任何情况立即通知我。初号机的情况如何？”

"The commander has lifted the freeze around it and has instructed you to do as you see fit. Though he said that under no circumstances does he want Unit 01 destroyed."  
“指挥官已经解除了对它的冻结，并指示您自行决定行动。不过他明确表示，在任何情况下都不希望初号机被摧毁。”

"I don't think he will have to worry about that."  
"我想他不必为此担心。"

Grabbing Shinji who was now sobbing on the floor she said, "If you want to help Asuka then follow my instructions."  
她抓住了在地上哭泣的真嗣，说道：“如果你想帮助明日香，那就听从我的指示。”

Shinji nodded and let her steer him towards his future.  
真嗣点点头，任由她引领自己走向未来。

---

Shinji was soon standing in front of Eva Unit 01. It looked like a demon more then anything that was supposed to defend mankind. On the way to Unit 01 Misato filled him in on everything from, the angels, Second Impact, the Eva's, and the purpose of Nerv. Shinji was now standing looking at Unit 01 digesting all the information that he had absorbed. Though throughout all Misato's information she left out everything about why Asuka was risking her life to protect him and everyone else. Shinji never would have guessed she would do that.  
真嗣很快站在了 EVA 初号机前。它看起来更像一个恶魔，而非本应守护人类的机器。前往初号机的路上，美里向他详细介绍了天使、第二次冲击、EVA 以及 NERV 的使命。真嗣现在站在初号机前，消化着所吸收的所有信息。尽管美里提供了大量信息，但她对为什么明日香会冒着生命危险保护他和所有人只字未提。真嗣从未料到她会这么做。

"Shinji," said a sudden booming voice.  
“真嗣，”一个突如其来的洪亮声音说道。

Shinji looked up past Unit 01 to a window at the top of the dock to see his father starring down at him.  
真嗣抬头望向初号机上方，码头顶端的窗户，看到他的父亲正俯视着他。

"Otou-san" "父亲大人"

"Shinji, do you know what piloting this Eva will do to change your life."  
"真嗣，你知道驾驶这个 Eva 会给你的生活带来怎样的改变吗？"

"Hai...and I'm prepared to take that responsibility. I will...protect Asuka and mankind."  
"是的...我已经准备好承担这个责任。我会...保护明日香和人类。"

His father continued to stare down at him. "Just remember that mankind as a whole is more important than a single individual."  
他的父亲继续低头盯着他。“记住，人类整体比单一个体更为重要。”

Shinji felt boiling rage at his father. 'So Asuka is just a simple object that lets you fulfill your objectives just like your using me now.'  
真嗣对他的父亲感到怒火中烧。‘所以明日香只是你实现目标的一个简单工具，就像你现在利用我一样。’

---

Gendo Ikari now cut the link between his son and himself and turned away to see his second in command Kozo Fuyutsuki standing their frowning at him.  
碇源堂切断了与儿子之间的联系，转身看到他的副手葛城美里站在那里，皱着眉头看着他。

"Is it wise to let your son pilot Unit 01."  
"让儿子驾驶初号机，明智吗？"

"Maybe not but with his help the Human Instrumentality Project will be sped up significantly. Its a risk I'm willing to take."  
"或许不明智，但有了他的帮助，人类补完计划将大大加速。这个风险我愿意承担。"

"What if _it_ happens." "万一发生了呢？"

"I have prepared for this day considerably. If _it_ does happen then I have taken the correct measures to prevent _it_ from getting out of hand. Also I still need Unit 02, for a while, so I don't want to lose it yet."  
“我已经为这一天做了充分的准备。如果真的发生了，我已经采取了正确的措施来防止事态失控。而且，我还需要 02 号机一段时间，所以现在还不想失去它。”

Kozo looked back at his friend. It was amazing how he could show so little emotion even when talking to his son. "If you think its worth it then we'll take it"  
“小藏回头看向他的朋友。令人惊叹的是，即使在与儿子交谈时，他也能表现出如此少的情感。“如果你认为值得，那我们就接受它。”

---

Shinji was sitting inside the entry plug inside Unit 01. He had received a shock when the plug had started to fill up with a clear fluid. He had at first panicked but relaxed when Misato said that it was to help him breath easier. Shinji felt slightly nauseous thought. It smelled like death somehow.  
“真嗣坐在 01 号机的插入栓内。当插入栓开始充满透明液体时，他受到了惊吓。起初他惊慌失措，但当美里说这是为了让他呼吸更顺畅时，他放松了下来。不过，真嗣还是感到有些恶心。不知为何，它闻起来像死亡的味道。”

"Shinji are you ready then."  
"真嗣，你准备好了吗？"

"Ha-hai." "哈-嗨。"

"Okay Asuka's Eva has just lost its umbilical cable so she has only five minutes left of energy left. We're sending you up elevator number five. It will put you closest to her position. When you get to the surface provide covering fire her while she dispatches the angel. Since you don't have any sync training this is as much as we expect of you."  
"好的，明日香的 EVA 刚刚失去了脐带电缆，所以她只剩下五分钟的能量了。我们派你乘坐五号电梯上去，它会把你送到离她最近的位置。当你到达地面时，为她提供掩护火力，同时她会处理掉那个使徒。由于你没有进行过同步训练，我们对你期望仅此而已。"

"Hai." "嗨。"

"Okay then release primary and secondary locks numbers one through thirteen. Have Eva Unit 01 proceeded to elevator number five."  
"好的，那么解除一到十三号主次锁定。让 Eva 初号机前往五号电梯。"

Shinji felt his Eva Unit being slowly moved forward on tracks that he couldn't see from where he was.  
真嗣感觉到他的 Eva 初号机正被看不见的轨道缓缓向前移动。

"What is Eva Unit 01's pilot sync rate," asked Misato.  
“EVA 初号机的驾驶员同步率是多少？”美里问道。

"Barely above the minimum forty-seven."  
“勉强高于最低的四十七。”

"Well, for a first time, its amazing. OK Eva Unit 01 at launch elevator. Release and close elevator shafts two, four, and seven. Propulsion system is all green. Sending Unit 01 to surface...now."  
“嗯，初次能做到这样已经很了不起了。好的，EVA 初号机，前往发射电梯。释放并关闭二号、四号和七号电梯井。推进系统一切正常。现在将初号机送往地面。”

Shinji was immediately jerked back into his seat as he felt himself rocketing up to the surface. 'Asuka please be okay,' he thought as he saw day light above him.  
真嗣立刻被猛地拽回座位，感觉自己正飞速冲向水面。'明日香，请一定要没事，'他想着，同时看到了上方的日光。

---

When Shinji first broke through to the surface he saw that Asuka and Unit 02 were being cornered against a building and was being hit repetitively.  
当真嗣首次破水而出时，他看到明日香和二号机被逼至一栋建筑旁，正遭受连续攻击。

"Damn it," yelled Shinji. "How the fuck do I even move this thing."  
“该死，”真嗣大喊，“这玩意儿到底怎么动啊。”

"Calm down Shinji," came Misato's voice. "Since the LCL fluid helps connect you to the Eva's mind all you have to do is think about moving and it will move. But you have to be concentrating really hard."  
"冷静点，真嗣，" 美里说道，"既然 LCL 液体有助于你与 Eva 的心灵连接，你只需集中精神想着移动，它就会动。但你必须非常专注。"

"Okay," said Shinji. He tried focusing on moving but an image of a slowly rotting Asuka kept on popping in his mind. 'No I promised her that I would help. I won't let that happen."  
"好的，" 真嗣说。他试图集中精力移动，但脑海中不断浮现出慢慢腐烂的明日香的形象。'不，我答应过她我会帮忙的。我不能让这种事发生。"

---

Misato was looking worriedly at the screen. "Unit 01 sync rate below minimum...what?"  
美里担忧地看着屏幕。"初号机同步率低于最低值...什么？"

Misato jerked over to the sound of the voice. "What?"  
美里听到声音猛地转过头。“什么？”

"Anomaly detected in the entry plug. Eva Unit 01 is rejecting the pilots thoughts."  
“插入栓内检测到异常。EVA 初号机正在排斥驾驶员的思维。”

"Quick eject the entry plug, protect the pilot."  
“快弹出插入栓，保护驾驶员。”

"Unable to, its rejecting the signature. Sync rate is dropping radically Eva Unit 01 has rejected the pilot and is shutting down. Life signs are dropping also. Unable to get a direct reading inside of Unit 01. Plug suit is not showing any vital signs."  
“无法执行，它在拒绝签名。同步率急剧下降，EVA 初号机已排斥驾驶员并正在关闭。生命迹象也在减弱。无法直接读取初号机内部情况。插入栓服未显示任何生命体征。”

Misato was standing horrified at Eva Unit 01. This was why no one was able to pilot it. It always rejected the pilot and killed it.  
美里站在 EVA 初号机前，惊恐万分。这就是为什么没人能驾驶它。它总是排斥驾驶员并将其杀死。

---

Inside the entry plug Shinji was gasping for breath. He had lost consciousness several times already but was still thinking over and over, 'move...move..move...move.'  
在插入栓内，真嗣喘息着。他已经多次失去意识，但仍一遍遍地想着，‘动啊...动啊...动啊...动啊...’

"GOD DAMN IT,' he screamed out loud. "I'VE GOT TO HELP ASUKA. DAMN YOU PILE OF SHIT MOVE...MOVE...move...mov-"  
"该死，'他大声咆哮。"我得去帮明日香。该死的破车，动啊...动...动...动-"

Shinji was slowly blacking out when he heard a voice in his head. 'So you want to help the person important to you.'  
真嗣渐渐失去意识时，他听到脑海中有个声音。'所以你想帮助对你重要的人。'

"Hai," he said weakly. "是的，"他虚弱地回答。

'Well I must say that out of all the pilots that have ever tried to sync with me you are easily the most interesting out of all of them. Your willpower is something to marvel at...very well I authorize you as the pilot of me Unit 01. From this day forth anybody else who tries to pilot me shall die upon entering this plug."  
“好吧，我必须承认，在所有试图与我同步的驾驶员中，你无疑是最引人注目的一个。你的意志力令人惊叹……很好，我授权你成为我的驾驶员，零一机。从今天起，任何试图驾驶我的人一旦进入驾驶舱，都将丧命。”

Shinji just smiled slightly and felt himself wake up. A faint green light was flashing on and off inside of the entry plug. It simply said Shinji Ikari.  
真嗣只是微微一笑，感觉自己醒了过来。驾驶舱内，一盏微弱的绿色灯光在闪烁。上面简单地写着：碇真嗣。

Suddenly Shinji felt white hot needles entering his skin. Looking down he saw that wires were digging into his skin and merging with his nerves. "What...are...you doing Unit 01."  
突然，真嗣感到皮肤像被滚烫的针刺入。低头一看，他发现电线正刺入他的皮肤，与他的神经融合。“零一机，你在做什么？”

'This is the only way to truly sync with me. With this I'm able to read your thought easier. Don't worry about the lose of blood. Its only temporary.'  
'这是唯一能与我真正同步的方法。这样一来，我能更容易读取你的思维。别担心失血，这只是暂时的。'

Now that Shinji looked he saw that a pool of blood was slowly building up around him, and that the LCL fluid was steadily turning into his own blood. 'Whatever,' he thought. 'As long as I save Asuka before I pass out I don't care.'  
现在，真嗣注意到自己周围正慢慢形成一滩血迹，LCL 液体也在逐渐变成他自己的血液。'无所谓了，'他想，'只要能在昏倒前救出明日香，我不在乎。'

'Thats what I like to hear,' said Eva Unit 01. 'Though if you don't mind its been a while since I was let loose like this so I'd like to have a little fun.'  
'我就喜欢你这种态度，'初号机说道，'不过，如果你不介意的话，我已经有段时间没这么自由了，所以我想稍微玩一玩。'

'What are you-' but then Shinji felt two hot wires pierce his temples and he knew no more.  
'你这是在——' 但随即，真嗣感到两股灼热如电的刺痛穿透了他的太阳穴，之后便一无所知了。

---

Shinji woke up to hear the sound of voices around him.  
真嗣醒来时，耳边环绕着周围的说话声。

"Its amazing that he survived with all the blood he lost."  
“他流了那么多血还能活下来，真是奇迹。”

"Even more amazing that Tokyo-3 isn't destroyed thanks to Unit 01 going berserk."  
"更令人惊叹的是，多亏了零号机发狂，第三新东京市竟然没有被摧毁。"

"Tell me what happened when you opened the entry plug again Misato?"  
"告诉我，当你再次打开插入栓时发生了什么，美里？"

"Shinji was just floating their with his plug suit on. All the controls had disappeared and he had those weird wires connected all along his body. What was even more disturbing was that the LCL fluid had mixed with his blood."  
"真嗣就那样穿着插入服漂浮在那里。所有的控制装置都消失了，他身上布满了奇怪的电线。更令人不安的是，LCL 液体已经和他的血液混合在一起了。"

"Doctor Akagi is that even possible?"  
"Doctor Akagi，这真的可能吗？"

"Theoretically yes, though its never been proven before."  
"理论上是的，尽管以前从未被证实过。"

Shinji slowly opened his eyes and saw a crowd of people around him.  
真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛，发现自己被一群人围着。

"Well, at least the angel was dispatched."  
"好吧，至少天使已经被派遣了。"

"Yes and thankfully Asuka had enough energy to disconnect Unit 01's umbilical cable or Unit 01 would still be rampaging around Tokyo-3."  
"是的，幸好明日香还有足够的能量断开 01 号机的脐带电缆，否则 01 号机还会在第三新东京市肆虐。"

Shinji opened his eyes wide at the mention of Asuka's named and looked back at everyone that was crowded around his bed, most of them which he had never seen before.  
听到明日香的名字，真嗣睁大了眼睛，回头看着围在他床边的众人，其中大多数他从未见过。

"What, where am I," he asked?  
"什么，我在哪里？" 他问道。

"Nerv hospital," replied Misato.  
"NERV 医院，" 美里回答道。

"What...how...I." "什么...怎么...我。"

"Calm down Shinji, everything is okay. The angel was defeated."  
"冷静点，真嗣，一切都好。使徒已经被打败了。"

Suddenly Shinji sat bolt upright which surprised everyone. "What happened to Asuka, where is she."  
突然，真嗣猛地坐直了身子，这让所有人都吃了一惊。“明日香怎么了，她在哪儿？”

"Right here baka." "就在这儿，笨蛋。"

Shinji looked around and saw Misato and Ritsuko move out of the way as Asuka walked up to Shinji's bed.  
真嗣环顾四周，看到美里和律子让开了路，让明日香走到真嗣的床边。

Misato motioned to Ritusko and everyone else to let the two be alone, and they left the room leaving the two teens to sort things out.  
美里示意律子和其他人让这对年轻人单独相处，他们便离开了房间，留下两个少年去解决问题。

With everyone gone Asuka sat down on the edge of Shinji's bed and looked out the window. Shinji meanwhile sat back down and was somehow comforted that she was next to him.  
所有人都离开后，明日香坐在真嗣床边，望向窗外。与此同时，真嗣也坐了回去，不知为何，她在他身边让他感到安慰。

"Why did you do that," asked Asuka breaking the silence.  
“你为什么要那么做？”明日香打破了沉默问道。

"Err do what," replied Shinji.  
“呃，做什么？”真嗣回答道。

Asuka turned to face him, took a deep breath and said, "Why did you risk your life, to the point of bleeding to death to help me."  
明日香转向他，深吸了一口气，说道：“你为什么要冒着生命危险，甚至流血至死来帮我。”

Shinji didn't even need to think about. "Well, this may sound stupid to you...and I don't care what you think but, even though we argue a lot and don't seem to get along...you're the first person that I've been able to talk to easily. I guess you could say that your my first friend."  
真嗣甚至不需要思考。“嗯，这对你来说可能听起来很蠢……而且我不在乎你怎么想，但尽管我们经常争吵，看起来相处得并不好……你是我第一个能轻松交谈的人。我想你可以说，你是我的第一个朋友。”

"You mean you've never had friends before me?"  
“你是说，在我之前你从来没有过朋友？”

"No, I've always been on the move my entire life. My father sent me from place to place so I never got to know people. Eventually I just shut everyone out around me since I knew that I would only be leaving eventually."  
“是的，我一生都在四处奔波。我父亲把我从一个地方送到另一个地方，所以我从没机会认识人。最终，我只是把自己封闭起来，因为我知道我迟早会离开。”

"Is that why you seem to hate your father so much?"  
"那就是你为什么似乎如此憎恨你父亲的原因吗？"

"Yes,"...'That and the fact that he abandoned me and let my mother die,' though Shinji thought this to himself.  
"是的，"...'还有他抛弃了我，让我母亲死去的事实，' 虽然真嗣只是在心里这么想。

Asuka was furious for some reason at Shinji. "You baka, I can take care of myself."  
不知为何，明日香对真嗣感到愤怒。"你这个笨蛋，我能照顾好自己。"

"I know its just-" Shinji didn't want to tell her about the vision he had of her rotting corpse.  
"我知道这只是——" 真嗣不想告诉她关于她腐烂尸体的幻象。

"Just what?" “什么意思？”

"Nothing, forget about it."  
"没什么，忘了吧。"

They both sat in silence for a while, then Asuka asked the next question. "What happened to you anyway...back their inside Eva Unit 01. It went berserk and tried to destroy everything in sight, including me...you weren't controlling it were you?"  
他们俩沉默地坐了一会儿，然后明日香问了下一个问题。"你到底怎么了……在那边，在 Eva 初号机里。它发狂了，试图摧毁视线中的一切，包括我……你不是在控制它，对吧？"

"No, Asuka I could never harm you. I don't remember much after I blacked out, but the Eva said that it would protect you if I let it have a little fun"  
"不，明日香，我绝不会伤害你。我昏迷后记不太清了，但 Eva 说只要让它稍微玩一下，它就会保护你。"

"So you didn't care what happened to Tokyo-3, as long as I was safe you were happy?"  
"所以你不在乎东京-3 发生什么，只要我安全你就满意了？"

"Hai, something like." "嗯，差不多是这样。"

"You baka, I'm not worth it."  
"你这个笨蛋，我不值得你这样。"

"Sorry...I just didn't want to lose you," suddenly his eyes narrowed. "And don't say that your not worth it, because you are," her words had brought back what his father had said about one individual compared to humanity.  
"对不起...我只是不想失去你，"突然他的眼神变得锐利。"而且不要说你不值得，因为你值得，"她的话让他想起了父亲曾经说过关于一个人与整个人类的比较。

"You honestly care that much about me," asked Asuka?  
"你真的这么在乎我吗？" 明日香问道？

"Yes I do...well when your like this at least."  
"是的，我确实...至少当你这样的时候。"

"Meaning what exactly," Asuka snapped back.  
"具体是什么意思？" 明日香厉声反问。"

Shinji was entering dangerous water but plunged ahead stubbornly, "Just that when your angry and moody your not that much fun to be around."  
真嗣正踏入危险的水域，但他固执地继续说："只是觉得当你生气和情绪低落时，和你在一起就没那么有趣了。"

"What was that you baka. If you weren't so badly injured I'd give a good whack on the head...but instead I'll do this. Slowly reaching around Shinji's neck she brought him into a small one armed hug. "Thanks for worrying about me...though if you ever say I'm not fun to be around when I'm angry I guarantee that you'll make up in the middle of the night breathing through your mouth."  
"你这个笨蛋，刚才那是什么。如果不是你伤得这么重，我真想好好敲一下你的头...不过现在，我只能这样。她缓缓地绕到真嗣的脖子旁，用一只手臂轻轻地抱住了他。“谢谢你担心我...不过如果你敢说我生气时不好相处，我保证你会半夜醒来只能用嘴呼吸。”

"You know its not very threatening when you're hugging me and telling me that at the same time."  
"你一边抱着我一边说这种话，实在没什么威胁力。"

Asuka broke apart from him now and gave him a weird look before she started laughing, and Shinji joined in.  
明日香松开了他，给了他一个奇怪的眼神，然后开始大笑，真嗣也跟着笑了起来。

When Asuka stopped laughing the first thing she said was, "You need to get to sleep now. Ritsuko says that you need to spend two days here until you recover. You lost a lot of blood and it wouldn't be good for you to pass out while at Misato's apartment."  
当明日香停止笑声后，她说的第一件事是：“你现在需要去睡觉了。律子说你需要在这里待上两天直到恢复。你失血过多，在美里公寓里昏倒可不好。”

"Yeah your probably right."  
“嗯，你大概是对的。”

They both looked at each other for a while before Asuka said, "Well I'll check up on you after I get back from school I guess."  
她们彼此对视了一会儿，然后明日香说：“好吧，我想我放学后会来看你的。”

"M'kay see you then." "好的，那到时候见。"

With that Asuka walked out of the hospital and Shinji leaned back to go to sleep but heard a ear splitting racket when Asuka left.  
说完，明日香走出了医院，真嗣则靠回椅背准备入睡，但明日香离开时却传来一阵震耳欲聋的噪音。

"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU GUYS DOING. WHERE YOU JUST LISTENING INTO OUR ENTIRE CONVERSATION."  
"你们他妈的在干什么？难道一直在偷听我们的对话吗？"

Shinji had to suppress a laugh as he rolled over, 'Typical Asuka,' he thought before he drifted off to sleep.  
真嗣翻身时不得不忍住笑意，'典型的明日香，'他想道，随后便沉沉睡去。

### Chapter 3: Visions 
第三章：幻象  

**OK well, against me better judgement I am posting chapter 3. This is...I don't know how to phrase it other than I'm amazed at how this chapter ended up. Lets just say that I hit off some of the more psychological aspects with this one and it in turn developed into the story which I intend on writing now. Funny how that works with me. I never find out how the story is going until I write the first few chapters. Anyway enough of my rambling...  
好吧，尽管违背我的判断，我还是发布了第三章。这...我不知道该如何表达，除了惊讶于这一章的结局。这么说吧，我触及了一些更心理层面的内容，结果它发展成了我现在打算写的故事。有趣的是，我总是要写完前几章才能知道故事的走向。好了，我的唠叨就到此为止...**

---

Gendo Ikari was looking down at the manila envelope on his desk. "Is this the data that you received from the first fight between the third angel and the pilot of Eva Unit 01?"  
碇源堂低头看着桌上的牛皮纸信封。“这是你在第三次使徒与 EVA 初号机驾驶员第一次战斗中收到的数据吗？”

"Hai," replied Ritsuko who was standing in front of the commanders desk.  
"嗨，" 站在指挥官办公桌前的律子回答道。

"And," asked Gendo in a evened voice? "What have you found."  
"那么，" 源堂用平稳的语气问道？"你发现了什么。

"Are you asking to give me a summary of that report."  
"你是要我给你总结那份报告吗。

Gendo nodded his head and waited for a reply.  
源堂点了点头，等待着回复。

Taking a deep breath Ritsuko started talking. "It seems that at first Eva Unit 01 rejected Shinji's synchronization. Though for some reason the Eva allowed him to pilot it after Shinji became upset about something."  
深吸一口气，律子开始讲述。“起初，EVA 初号机似乎拒绝了真嗣的同步。但不知为何，真嗣因为某事变得沮丧后，EVA 却允许他驾驶了。”

"Does this pertain to Pilot 02."  
“这与二号驾驶员有关吗？”

"Hai, I believe so. Shinji was screaming something about Asuka and from what I have determined the Eva saw how much willpower Shinji possessed and allowed him to pilot it."  
"海，我相信是的。真嗣一直在尖叫关于明日香的事情，根据我的判断，Eva 看到了真嗣所拥有的意志力，因此允许他驾驶。"

"Is he still usable as a pilot?"  
"他还能作为驾驶员使用吗？"

"I can't confirm that without sync tests, commander."  
"没有同步测试，我无法确认这一点，指挥官。"

Gendo continued to look at her evenly waiting for her to continue.  
源渡继续平静地看着她，等待她继续说下去。

"Now, about Eva Unit 01's reaction. It seems that something happened inside of the entry plug between Shinji and the Eva. This is confirmed by Misato Katsuragi's testimony of what she discovered when the entry plug was removed and the LCL fluid was removed."  
“现在，关于 EVA 初号机的反应。似乎在真嗣和 EVA 之间，插入栓内发生了什么。这一点得到了葛城美里关于她在移除插入栓和 LCL 液体时所发现情况的证词的证实。”

"Meaning?" “什么意思？”

"What were originally thought to be metallic wires are the Eva's nerves. Apparently they connected directly with Shinji's nervous system so as to sync with him better. According to analysis when they synced the ratio was well above Asuka's highest ratio. It also seems that Eva Unit 01 will reject anybody that enters the entry plug and is not Shinji. We had a scientist exam the inside of the entry plug while it was inserted into the Eva. Apparently he suffered from a high level of contamination."  
"最初被认为是金属线的其实是 EVA 的神经。显然，它们直接与真嗣的神经系统相连，以便更好地同步。根据分析，当他们同步时，比例远超明日香的最高比例。似乎 EVA 初号机会排斥任何进入插入栓且不是真嗣的人。我们让一位科学家在插入栓插入 EVA 时检查其内部。显然，他遭受了高水平的污染。""

"Is that all?" "就这些吗？""

"One last thing, sir. I don't know why but when Shinji's blood mixed with the LCL fluid it omitted a reaction similar to the same pattern that an angel gives off."  
"还有最后一件事，长官。我不知道为什么，但当真嗣的血液与 LCL 液体混合时，它产生了一种类似于使徒发出的反应模式。""

"Pattern blue?" "蓝色模式？"

"Hai sir. Whatever changed with the LCL fluid made the AT field of the Eva stronger for a brief period."  
"是的，长官。LCL 液体的变化使得 EVA 的 AT 力场在短时间内变得更强了。"

Gendo leaned back in his chair now with his hands in his lap.  
碇源堂向后靠在椅子上，双手放在膝上。

"Very well then Ritsuko. If that is all you may go."  
"很好，那么，律子。如果没别的事，你可以走了。"

"Hai, commander Ikari." "明白，碇司令。"

When Ritsuko left Gendo picked up the manila file and leafed through it before pausing on a picture of his son. "Maybe I should have never brought him to Tokyo-3 in the first place."  
当律子离开后，碇源堂拿起那份马尼拉纸文件，翻阅着，直到目光停留在他儿子的照片上。"也许我一开始就不该把他带到第三新东京市。"

"And yet thanks to him we now are able to use Eva Unit 01 to its full potential," said Kozo as he stepped out of the shadows. "Though having him around still proves to be a risk."  
"然而多亏了他，我们现在能够充分发挥 Eva 初号机的全部潜力，" 高雄从阴影中走出说道。"尽管有他在身边仍然是个风险。"

"He was always a risk but we took it and see what happened."  
"他一直是个风险，但我们还是冒了这个险，看看发生了什么。"

"Yes but Ritsako's data didn't give you anything that you didn't know already."  
"是的，但律子的数据并没有给你带来任何你原本不知道的信息。"

Gendo frowned and looked down at the envelope. "Maybe, but the information about Shinji and Pilot 02 could prove to be useful."  
源堂皱了皱眉，低头看着那封信封。“或许吧，但关于真嗣和二号驾驶员的信息可能会证明是有用的。”

"Meaning," asked Kozo with a raised eyebrow.  
“你的意思是？” 高雄挑起眉毛问道。

Gendo smirked, "He's got a reason to pilot Eva Unit 01 as long as Pilot 02 is still working with Nerv."  
源堂冷笑道，“只要二号驾驶员还在与 NERV 合作，他就有理由继续驾驶 EVA 初号机。”

---

Shinji was released from the hospital two days later in a full recovery. Misato threw a party for him in his return. Though it consisted of Misato, Ritsuko, and a rather reluctant Asuka.  
两天后，真嗣完全康复出院了。美里为他举办了一个欢迎回家派对。虽然参加的只有美里、律子和一个不太情愿的明日香。

"Ah why do I have to celebrate this. Its so stupid. Its the baka's own fault for ending up like that in the first place."  
“啊，为什么我非得庆祝这个。真是蠢透了。说到底，那笨蛋自己搞成那样，怪得了谁。”

Misato paused in the middle of chugging a can of beer. "Asuka the least you could be is somewhat relieved he's at least alive."  
美里正大口喝着一罐啤酒，停了下来。“明日香，至少你可以为他还活着感到一丝欣慰吧。”

Shinji sighed and said, "Really Misato I don't care that much whether she's glad I'm here or not."  
真嗣叹了口气，说道：“真的，美里，我并不太在乎她是否高兴我在这里。”

Asuka threw Shinji a scowl and stood up and walked toward her door and slammed it shut.  
明日香瞪了真嗣一眼，站起身走向自己的房门，砰的一声关上了。

Ritsuko sighed and turned to Misato, "I heard that Kaji has been reassigned here."  
律子叹了口气，转向美里，“我听说加持已经被调到这里了。”

Misato responded by spitting out her beer spraying Shinji in the face. "WHAT, THAT JERK IS STATIONED HERE."  
美里回应的方式是吐出啤酒，喷了真嗣一脸。“什么，那个混蛋被调到这里来了。”

"Hai," said Ritsuko calmly.  
“是，”律子平静地说。

"Who's Kaji," asked Shinji.  
“谁是加持？”真嗣问道。

Misato was about to open her mouth and say he was a stuck up jerk and a pervert when Ritsuko answered for her, "He's Misato's ex boyfriend."  
美里正要张嘴说他是个自以为是的混蛋兼变态，这时律子替她回答了，“他是美里的前男友。”

Shinji was rather shocked at that and looked to see Misato steadily turning red in the face. "As if I need reminding that a dated that damn jerk." Misato turned her gaze to Shinji, "How is school going for you now?"  
真嗣对此颇为震惊，转头看到美里的脸正逐渐变红。“好像我需要提醒自己曾经和那个该死的混蛋交往过似的。”美里将目光转向真嗣，“你现在学校情况怎么样？”

Shinji shrugged and said, "Little different then normal. Except all the guys in the class hate me."  
真嗣耸了耸肩说：“和平时有点不一样。只是班上所有男生都讨厌我。”

"Why's that?" "为什么呢？"

"Because I live with Asuka, their jealous. Heh I'd like to see them try living with her for a day and survive."  
"因为我跟明日香住在一起，他们嫉妒了。呵，我倒想看看他们试着跟她住一天还能不能活下来。"

"I heard that you asshole," came a voice through a closed door.  
"我听到你这个混蛋的话了，"一个声音从关着的门后传来。"

Shinji sighed and looked at his watch. "Uh I just got back and its time for school already."  
真嗣叹了口气，看了看手表。"呃，我刚回来，又该去学校了。"

"Well, here then," said Misato as she tossed Shinji a lunch.  
"那么，给你，"美里说着将一份午餐扔给了真嗣。

Shinji tried not to look disgusted and gave her a weak smile, "Uh thanks Misato."  
真嗣尽量不表现出厌恶，给了她一个虚弱的微笑，"呃，谢谢美里。"

"No problem, theirs one for Asuka too."  
"不客气，也给明日香准备了一份。"

Shinji could hardly suppress a groan.  
真嗣几乎忍不住要呻吟出声。

"Oh and Shinji I promised you that I would take you shopping for new clothes but I won't be back till late tonight. So I want Asuka to take you instead."  
“哦对了，真嗣，我答应过要带你去买新衣服的，但我今晚要很晚才能回来。所以我想让明日香带你去。”

"WHAT THE FUCK," came a loud yell from another room.  
“搞什么鬼，”另一个房间传来一声大喊。

Asuka immediately stormed out of her room and planted both hands on the table. "What the fuck do you mean I'm supposed to take this baka out shopping," she said this while pointing at Shinji. "Thats something that a mother should do."  
明日香立刻冲出房间，双手重重地拍在桌子上。“你他妈什么意思，让我带这个笨蛋去购物？”她一边说一边指向真嗣，“这种事应该是妈妈做的。”

"Think of this as a time to get to know each other a little better so you wont be arguing all the time because to tell you the truth I'm getting annoyed with it."  
“把这当作一个增进彼此了解的机会吧，这样你们就不会总是争吵了，说实话，我对此已经感到厌烦了。”

"If this baka wasn't such an idiot and a sociopath maybe I could get along with him. But he's had about as much social interaction between two humans beings as the teachers pet, First Child."  
“如果这个笨蛋不是这么白痴和反社会，也许我能和他相处得来。但他的人际交往能力简直就像老师的宠儿，第一适格者一样糟糕。”

Misato sighed, "This is exactly what I mean. Your constant bickering is enough to drive anyone crazy."  
美里叹了口气，“这正是我想说的。你们没完没了的争吵足以把人逼疯。”

"Hell no I'm not doing this," said Asuka while folding her arm.  
“绝对不干，”明日香一边说一边抱起双臂。

"Then how bout this. I'm _ordering_ you to take Shinji shopping."  
“那这样如何。我命令你带真嗣去购物。”

"And if I refuse." "如果我拒绝呢。"

"Then we take you off Unit 02."  
"那我们就把你从二号机上撤下来。"

Asuka flinched at that. "Ah damn you Misato. Fine I'll take the damn baka downtown later."  
听到这话，明日香退缩了。"该死的美里。好吧，我晚点会带这个笨蛋去市区的。"

Asuka grabbed Shinji by the collar then and dragged him off to school.  
明日香抓住真嗣的衣领，拽着他向学校走去。

"Will those to ever get along," mused Ritsuko?  
“他们俩能和睦相处吗？”律子若有所思地说。

"Not in this lifetime," said Misato.  
“这一生是不可能了，”美里说。

---

School had become something of a hell for Shinji. All the guys in the class still hated him and were still jealous that he and Asuka walked to school together every morning. Though he wasn't sure why all the girls hated him also. Maybe it had something to do with them being jealous of Asuka.  
学校对真嗣来说已经成了某种地狱。班上的男生们依然恨他，依然嫉妒他和明日香每天早上一起上学。虽然他不明白为什么女生们也恨他。也许是因为她们嫉妒明日香。

"Hey," said Asuka as they walked into class. "You did pack our own lunches and not the ones that Misato gave you."  
“嘿，”明日香走进教室时说道，“你带的是我们自己准备的午餐，不是美里给你的那些吧。”

"Hai," said Shinji as he handed her hers.  
“嗯，”真嗣说着递给她自己的那份。

She took it without another look at him and sat down at her desk. Shinji sighed and followed her and sat in his desk behind her.  
她接过东西，没再瞧他一眼，便坐回了自己的桌前。真嗣叹了口气，跟着她走过去，坐在她身后的座位上。

"Look how smug that bastard is about sitting close to Asuka."  
看看那混蛋坐在明日香旁边得意的样儿。

Shinji heard this and moved his eyes slightly to the left to see the boys who's names he didn't know were talking about him.  
真嗣听到这话，微微向左移动视线，看到了那些他不知道名字的男生正在议论他。

Immediately a rush of images hit him pertaining to the boy. Shinji found himself watching the boy walking into some magazine store and browsing some of the more explicit ones. Next second he was watching the person showering. What disgusted Shinji the most he was masturbating and screaming Asuka's name at the same time. 'What the fuck is this,' thought Shinji. 'Why am I thinking this...or I'm I somehow seeing what this guy does.'  
霎时间，一连串关于那男孩的画面涌入他的脑海。真嗣发现自己正看着那男孩走进一家杂志店，翻阅着一些更为露骨的杂志。下一秒，他看到那人在洗澡。最让真嗣恶心的是，那人一边自慰一边尖叫着明日香的名字。'这他妈是怎么回事，'真嗣心想。'为什么我会想到这些...还是我不知怎么地看到了这家伙的行为？'

Reality came back and Shinji found himself starring at the blackboard which the teacher had started scribbling on.  
现实回归，真嗣发现自己正盯着黑板，老师已经开始在上面涂写。

'C'mon to think of it,' thought Shinji. 'It seems...familiar somehow.' Then he thought of the corpse like Asuka in his mind, her right eyeball running free of its socket. How the ends of her fingers looked like they had been chewed off, leaving the bone.  
'来想想看，'真嗣心想。'这似乎...有些熟悉。'然后他想起了脑海中明日香那具尸体般的模样，她的右眼球脱离了眼眶。她的指尖像是被啃食过，只剩下骨头。

'NOOOO THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.'  
'不！那不可能发生。'

'But it will unless you stop it,' said Asuka.  
'但如果你不阻止，它就会发生，'明日香说。

'GOD DAMNIT, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS IS.'  
'该死，我甚至不知道这是什么。'

"Hey baka." Shinji felt something rather hard slap him across the side of his face. He was pulled out of the nightmare to see Asuka frowning at him. "What," he said rather snappishly. Asuka simply pointed to the front of the room.  
"嘿，笨蛋。" 真嗣感到有什么硬物猛地打在了他的脸颊上。他从噩梦中惊醒，看到明日香正皱着眉头盯着他。"怎么了，" 他有些不耐烦地说。明日香只是指了指房间的前方。

"Shinji Ikari are you here."  
"碇真嗣，你在这里吗？"

"Ha-hai," Shinji felt his voice working overtime just to get the words out.  
"哈-哈伊，" 真嗣觉得自己的声音几乎要超负荷才能说出话来。

The teacher frowned at him and went back to his lecture.  
老师皱着眉头看了他一眼，又继续讲课了。

---

During lunch Shinji was leaning against the railing on the school roof thinking of what had happened to him during the morning. It seemed so realistic, whatever it was, and disturbing. The thing about Asuka still scared him though. He had thought that he had prevented it from happening but it looked like she could still die.  
午餐时，真嗣靠在学校屋顶的栏杆上，回想着上午发生在他身上的事情。那一切似乎如此真实，且令人不安。关于明日香的事依然让他感到恐惧。他本以为自己已经阻止了那件事的发生，但看起来她仍有可能死去。

'Damn it, what is happening to me. Am I some kind of psychic.' Really he wouldn't have put it past his own father to experiment on his newborn body.  
'该死，我到底是怎么了。难道我是什么心灵感应者吗？' 说真的，他不会怀疑自己的父亲在他刚出生时就在他身上做实验。

Suddenly he heard the door slamming open and saw that Asuka was striding over to him with a look of pure fury on her face. 'Great,' thought Shinji. 'What did I do this time?'  
突然，他听到门砰地一声被撞开，只见明日香怒气冲冲地朝他走来。'真棒，'真嗣心想。'这次我又做了什么？'

As she got closer he closed his eyes waiting for the hit to come, but it never did. Instead Asuka leaned up against the railing and threw her arms over the side. With that done she opened her mouth and screamed at the top of her voice. The sound echoed all across the academy grounds and Shinji had to cover his ears since she was next to him.  
当她走近时，他闭上眼睛等待着那一拳的到来，但它始终没有落下。相反，明日香靠在栏杆上，双臂搭在栏杆外。做完这些后，她张开嘴，用尽全力尖叫起来。声音在整个学院的场地上回荡，真嗣不得不捂住耳朵，因为她就在他旁边。

"What the hell was that about," asked Shinji?  
“这到底是怎么回事？”真嗣问道。

Asuka threw him a scowl before saying, "This school is a pain in the ass. I can think of a hundred things I could be doing right now. Plus all these perverted guys are starting to get on my nerves. A few actually tried to grope me."  
明日香瞪了他一眼，然后说道：“这学校真是烦死人了。我现在能想到一百件我想做的事。而且这些色狼越来越让我受不了。有几个居然还想摸我。”

Shinji had to suppress a laugh, "So what happened to them?"  
真嗣强忍住笑，问道：“那他们后来怎么样了？”

"One of them has his fingers shoved up the drinking fountain faucet. While the other one actually tried to ambush me in the girls bathroom. He's got his head stuck half way down a toilet now."  
“其中一个手指被塞进了饮水机的出水口。另一个居然在女厕所埋伏我，现在他的头卡在马桶里一半。”

Shinji did laugh this time. It was a relief to have her anger directed at someone else for a change.  
这次真嗣笑了。她的怒火能转向别人，这让他松了一口气。

"So what was wrong with you earlier this morning?"  
“那你今天早上怎么了？”

Shinji's smile dropped when he heard her question. "Nothing," he said simply.  
听到她的问题，真嗣的笑容消失了。“没什么，”他简单地回答。

"Don't give my that crap. You were starring off into nothing. What are you some kind psychopath."  
"别跟我扯这些废话。你刚才明显在发呆。你是不是有什么心理问题啊。"

Shinji didn't want to have to listen to her bitching at a time like this and ignored her  
真嗣不想在这种时候还得听她唠叨，于是选择了无视她

Then the two of them heard voices coming up the stairs.  
接着，两人听到楼梯上传来声音。

"So you got the pictures right?"  
"所以你拍到了那些照片，对吧？"

"Yeah she was getting a drink at the fountain and I stuck my camera under her skirt a little and got a shot of it."  
"对，她正在喷泉边取水喝，我稍微把相机伸到她裙子下面，拍到了一张。"

"And...what color." "然后呢...是什么颜色的？"

"White unfortunately." "真可惜，是白色的。"

"Even so half the guys in the school will want a copy of it. We should sell it for five dollars a picture...what do you think."  
"即便如此，学校里一半的男生都会想要一份。我们应该每张照片卖五美元...你觉得呢？"

"Sounds fair enough, though we'll want to keep this low. If she finds out what were doing she'll kill us. I've heard she messed some guys up pretty bad for trying to grope her."  
"听起来挺合理的，不过我们得低调行事。如果她发现我们在做什么，她会杀了我们的。我听说她对那些试图非礼她的家伙下手很重。"

"But its not like we'll be walking down the hallways with signs saying, COME GET A PICTURE OF ASUKA'S UNDERWEAR FIVE DOLLARS A PICTURE."  
“但也不至于我们会在走廊里举着牌子说，‘来拍明日香的内裤照吧，五美元一张’。”

"No I guess not." “我想应该不会。”

The two of them continued laughing as they walked up the stairs to the roof. When they got over the last landing they froze when they saw Asuka and Shinji starring back at them. Shinji seemed somewhat amused, knowing what was gonna happen. Asuka however was starring back at Kensuke and Touji with a death grin on her face.  
两人继续笑着走上通往屋顶的楼梯。当他们跨过最后一级台阶时，看到明日香和真嗣正盯着他们，顿时僵住了。真嗣似乎有些幸灾乐祸，知道接下来会发生什么。而明日香则带着一副死亡微笑，盯着健介和斗志。

Kensuke realized only to late that any hope of making money was just destroyed.  
剑介意识到得太晚了，任何赚钱的希望刚刚都被摧毁了。

"Oh boys," said Asuka sweetly. "I think you have something that I need to look at."  
“哦，男孩们，”明日香甜甜地说道，“我想你们有些东西我需要看看。”

Kensuke and Touji turned around to make a run for it but Asuka grabbed the back of their shirts and held onto them tight.  
剑介和冬二转身想逃跑，但明日香抓住了他们衬衫的后摆，紧紧地拽住。

"So were is it," she asked again in that sweet honey voice. It sent a chill down Shinji's spine. He hoped to never piss her off enough to make her use that voice.  
“那么，它在哪儿？”她再次用那甜美如蜜的声音问道。这声音让真嗣脊背发凉。他希望永远不要惹她生气到使用这种声音的地步。

Kensuke whimpered and held up the camera.  
剑介呜咽着举起了相机。

Asuka took it without question, and took out the tape. She tossed it at Shinji who caught it rather surprised that she would let him hold it. Trying not to think about what was on it Shinji pocketed it for now.  
明日香毫不犹豫地接过相机，取出了里面的磁带。她将磁带扔给真嗣，真嗣有些惊讶她会让他拿着，尽量不去想里面是什么内容，真嗣暂时把它放进了口袋。

Asuka now looked at the two of them nastily. "Right you two know what you've done and your reward is this."  
明日香此刻恶狠狠地盯着他们俩。“你们俩知道自己干了什么，这就是你们的下场。”

She kicked both of them in the balls sending them to their knees. Shinji had to turn away so as not to here the low grunting. It was something he would rather not experience. Just watching it was bad enough.  
她一脚踢向两人的裆部，让他们跪倒在地。真嗣不得不转过头去，以免听到那低沉的呻吟。这是他宁愿不去体验的。光是看着就已经够糟糕了。

Asuka now walked over to Shinji and held out her hand. He obediently took the tape out of his pocket and handed it to her. She put it back in and walked over to the railing of the school and dropped the camera off the school roof where it fell five stories and shattered upon contact with the ground. Shinji looked over and saw that the tape had broken apart and tape reel was strewn over the ground.  
明日香走到真嗣面前，伸出手。他顺从地从口袋里拿出录像带递给她。她将录像带放回相机，走到学校的栏杆旁，将相机从屋顶扔下，五层楼的高度让它落地时摔得粉碎。真嗣望过去，看到录像带已经断裂，磁带卷散落一地。

He suddenly felt Asuka grab his arm and said, "Fuck this. I'm done with school for today. Lets go home."  
他突然感觉到明日香抓住了他的手臂，说道：“去他妈的。我今天不想上学了。我们回家吧。”

Shinji wasn't able to do anything but nod.  
真嗣除了点头什么也做不了。

---

Being back home though was boring. Asuka immediately grabbed a soda and a bag of chips and sat down to watch T.V. for the rest of the day. Shinji sat with her for a while but eventually got annoyed with trying to understand what she was watching, it was in German.  
然而回到家后却很无聊。明日香立刻抓起一罐汽水和一袋薯片，坐下来准备看一整天的电视。真嗣和她一起坐了一会儿，但最终因为试图理解她在看什么而感到烦躁，那节目是德语的。

So Shinji went to his room and flopped down on his futon and tried to take a nap, but every time he closed his eyes that unbidden image of a rotting Asuka floated into his mind again. It was starting to get on his nerves now. How was he supposed to know when to stop her from dying? Its not like he could follow her everywhere she went, and she certainly wouldn't allow it anyway  
于是真嗣回到自己的房间，扑倒在榻榻米上试图小睡一会儿，但每次他闭上眼睛，那幅不由自主的腐烂明日香影像就会再次浮现在脑海中。这已经开始让他感到烦躁了。他怎么知道何时该阻止她死去？他不可能随时随地跟着她，而且她肯定也不会允许的。

In his feigned sleep he heard somebody open the door. Knowing it was Asuka he pretended to ignore her but was unable to when she kicked him in the side.  
在他假装睡觉时，他听到有人打开了门。知道是明日香，他假装不理会，但当她踢了他侧身一脚时，他无法再装下去。

"Get up baka, were going out."  
“起来，笨蛋，我们要出去。”

Shinji rolled over and was surprised to see Asuka standing their fully dressed. She was wearing a tight, red, sleeveless shirt that failed to hide a slight cleavage, and a dark tight blue pair of jeans. Shinji also saw that she had sun glasses on her head and that she was also wearing sandals.  
真嗣翻身一看，惊讶地发现明日香已经穿戴整齐地站在那里。她穿着一件紧身的红色无袖上衣，隐约露出一点乳沟，下身是一条深蓝色的紧身牛仔裤。真嗣还注意到她头上戴着太阳镜，脚上穿着凉鞋。

"C'mon baka, Misato wanted me to take you shopping so thats what I'm gonna do. Anything is better then just sitting on the couch and getting fat. Besides I need some new clothes too so thats the only reason that I'm doing this," she added.  
“快点，笨蛋，美里让我带你去购物，所以我就得这么做。总比整天坐在沙发上发胖强。再说了，我也需要买些新衣服，这是我唯一愿意做这件事的原因。”她补充道。

Shinji was surprised but nodded and turned to the bathroom to start changing.  
真嗣虽然惊讶，但还是点了点头，转身去浴室开始换衣服。

Several minutes later Shinji came out wearing blue jeans with a white short sleeve shirt, his favorite.  
几分钟后，真嗣穿着他最喜欢的蓝色牛仔裤和白色短袖衬衫走了出来。

Asuka looked him up and down, sighed and said, 'You really have no sense of fashion do you."  
明日香上下打量了他一番，叹了口气说：“你真是毫无时尚感，对吧。”

Shinji raised and eyebrow and walked past her to put his shoes on.  
真嗣挑了挑眉毛，从她身边走过去穿鞋。

'Coward,' thought Asuka before she followed him out the door.  
'胆小鬼，' 明日香在心里想着，随后跟着他走出了门。

---

They were in a part of Tokyo-3 which Shinji had hardly ever walked in. Asuka seemed to know her way around though fairly well.  
他们来到了东京-3 的一个区域，真嗣几乎从未涉足过。但明日香似乎对这里相当熟悉。

Soon though Shinji was wishing he hadn't let her drag him out there. The first store she dragged him into was nothing women's undergarments. Shinji had a feeling that Asuka was making him nervous on purpose. While she browsed around Shinji tried not to focus on one thing to long. He was starting to sweat and he saw that several other girls were looking at him and giggling rather loudly. Either Asuka saw this or not she didn't say.  
很快，真嗣就后悔让她把自己拖到这里来了。她拉他进的第一家店就是卖女性内衣的。真嗣有种感觉，明日香是故意让他紧张的。她在店里逛来逛去，真嗣尽量不去长时间关注某一样东西。他开始出汗，注意到有几个女孩正看着他，大声地偷笑。不管明日香有没有注意到这一点，她都没有说什么。

Asuka turned around then and held up a red bra. Showing it to Shinji who was determinedly looking the other way she said, "Well, what do you think baka. I think it would go rather well with my hair, and of course I'll have to buy matching underwear to go with it."  
明日香转过身来，举起一件红色胸罩。她向坚决不看向她的真嗣展示着，说道：“好吧，你觉得怎么样，笨蛋。我觉得它和我的头发很配，当然我还得买配套的内衣来搭配它。”

"Do you want my honest opinion," said Shinji who now had his back to her.  
“你想听我的真实意见吗？”真嗣背对着她说道。

"That is why I'm asking you, baka."  
“所以我才问你，笨蛋。”

Shinji took a deep breath hoping that he wouldn't regret his words and said, "That looks like something that a stripper would wear."  
真嗣深吸了一口气，希望自己不会后悔说出这些话，然后说道：“那看起来像是脱衣舞娘会穿的。”

Asuka was rather shocked that he had the nerve to say that. Though she was also glad that for once he had spoken his mind. In truth she had showed him it just to see what he would say. She hadn't really considered buying it in the first place. Smirking at his back she said, "Yeah I guess your right."  
明日香相当震惊他居然有胆量这么说。不过她也感到高兴，因为这次他终于说出了心里话。实际上，她给他看那件衣服只是想看看他会怎么反应，并没有真的考虑要买。她对着他的背影微微一笑，说道：“是啊，我想你说的没错。”

Shinji was surprised that she actually valued his opinion. "So are we done here?"  
真嗣惊讶于她竟然真的重视他的意见。“那我们这里的事就算完了？”

"Course not. I've got something that I seriously want to look at."  
“当然不是。我有件非常想看的东西。”

Asuka now grabbed Shinji's arm and steered him over to the swimsuit part of the store. For the next half an hour Asuka sorted through many different choices asking Shinji's opinion on some of them. Shinji who thought of how she would look every time she held a pair up simply shrugged and shook his head.  
现在，明日香抓住了真嗣的手臂，把他带到商店的泳装区。接下来的半小时里，明日香翻阅了许多不同的选择，不时询问真嗣的意见。每次她拿起一件泳装时，真嗣只是耸耸肩，摇摇头，心里想着她穿上会是什么样子。

"A lot of help your being," said Asuka.  
“你可真帮不上忙，”明日香说道。

"Is this something that most guys are supposed to know about?"  
"这是大多数男生都应该知道的事情吗？"

Asuka ignored him and went to the changing room to try on what she just picked out.  
明日香没理他，径直走向更衣室去试穿她刚挑中的衣服。

Shinji was leaning against the wall when Asuka step up to him and said, "Well, what do you think."  
真嗣靠在墙上，明日香走到他面前问道：“怎么样，你觉得呢？”

Shinji had to control his hormones correctly for this one. She had just put on a two piece red bathing suit that had a white strip going along the middle of the top. Shinji blinked and turned away so that he wouldn't be starring so much.  
真嗣这次得好好控制自己的荷尔蒙。她刚穿上一件红色两件式泳衣，上衣中间有一条白色条纹。真嗣眨了眨眼，转过身去，以免盯着她看太久。

"Ah fuck you Shinji, your no help." Asuka turned around to go back in and change out of it when Shinji spoke up, "I think you should get that."  
“啊，去你的，真嗣，你一点忙都帮不上。” 明日香转身准备回去换掉泳衣，这时真嗣开口了，“我觉得你应该买这件。”

Asuka turned around to see him determinedly looking the other way. "Your just saying that so we can leave, aren't you."  
明日香转过身来，看到他坚决地看着别处。“你只是这么说，好让我们能离开，对吧。”

Shinji didn't want to let up on how good he thought it looked on her. He was unwilling starting to get stiff and didn't want her to notice. "No, I think...that the red goes well with your hair."  
真嗣不想放弃他认为这衣服在她身上很好看的想法。他开始感到僵硬，不想让她注意到。“不，我觉得……红色和你的头发很配。”

Asuka raised an eyebrow at him and said, "Hmph whether you think it looks good or not I was planning on buying it anyway." Asuka walked past him but paused and smirked, "By the way try not to be so noticeable next time. I can tell you were starring at my chest."  
明日香对他挑了挑眉，说道：“哼，不管你觉得好不好看，反正我本来就打算买这件。”明日香从他身边走过，但停下脚步，微微一笑，“顺便说一句，下次尽量不要这么显眼。我能看出你一直在盯着我的胸部。”

She walked past him to change into her normal clothes leaving him to gape back at her. 'Damn her,' he thought. 'She just loves to aggravate me.'  
她从他身边走过，去换上平常的衣服，留下他目瞪口呆地看着她。‘该死，’他想，‘她就喜欢惹我生气。’

---

Predictably Shinji was stuck carrying the stuff that she had picked out. Now Asuka was looking around at the shops trying to decide what place would be best to get Shinji some new clothes.  
不出所料，真嗣正扛着她挑选的东西。现在，明日香正环顾四周的商店，试图决定哪一家最适合给真嗣买些新衣服。

Shinji was getting bored though and didn't particularly care whether he got new clothes or not. It's not like anyone was going to notice a change if he did dress a little differently.  
然而，真嗣开始感到无聊，并不特别在意是否要买新衣服。就算他穿得有些不同，也不会有人注意到这种变化。

"Hey, Asuka." “嘿，明日香。”

"Hmm." "嗯。"

"Lets skip this. I don't care whether I get new clothes or not."  
"跳过这个吧。我不在乎是否得到新衣服。"

"Misato ordered me to get you some, so I don't have a choice."  
"美里让我给你买一些，所以我别无选择。"

"But I'm saying that I don't care. It was bad enough being stuck in that...last store."  
"但我的意思是，我不在乎。被困在那个...上一家店里已经够糟糕的了。"

Asuka turned to him now and a grin appeared on her face. "Good because I wasn't taking this seriously anyway. I just wanted you with me so that I didn't have to carry my bags. Though make sure you tell Misato that I took you but you changed your mind. I don't want to get chewed out by her."  
明日香转过身来，脸上露出了笑容。"太好了，反正我也没认真对待。我只是想让你陪我，这样我就不用自己拎包了。不过记得告诉美里是我带你去的，但你改变了主意。我不想被她骂。"

"Hai, I will." "好的，我会说的。"

"Good, then lets go home. My feet are getting sore from all this walking anyway."  
“好，那我们回家吧。我的脚已经走得酸痛了。”

---

Soon the sun had started to set and rush hour was just starting. Shinji was walking a few paces behind Asuka and for some reason couldn't shake a worried feeling that he had all the sudden. 'What is this,' he thought as he looked around at the traffic rushing by him. 'Why do I have a sickening feeling as though something is going to happ-'  
不久，太阳开始西沉，高峰时段刚刚开始。真嗣跟在明日香后面几步远，不知为何突然感到一阵莫名的担忧。'这是怎么了，'他环顾四周疾驰而过的车流，心中思索，'为什么我会突然有种不祥的预感，仿佛即将发生什么——'

---

Shinji felt reality slip away from him. He was now above the street that he had just been walking on and looking down at the cars and pedestrians walking along. 'Why does this seem so...familiar? I don't think I've ever been to this side of Tokyo-3 before. Yet I can't shake this feeling that something is going to happen.'  
真嗣感到现实从他身边滑走。他现在正悬浮在刚刚走过的街道上方，俯视着下方的车辆和行人。'为什么这一切看起来如此……熟悉？我不记得曾来过第三新东京市的这一带。然而，我无法摆脱那种即将发生什么的感觉。'

At his thoughts he saw somebody stumble into the road. Next second the person was hit in the side from an oncoming truck and was dragged under. Even though Shinji couldn't see what was happening from his vantage point he could see that it was a gruesome scene. The person had been spit back out from under the truck and was now lying helpless in the road. Blood was seeping out onto the road where the person laid and Shinji could see unmistakable signs of body tissue. Even though he told himself it was all a dream he still felt like puking.  
他正想着，突然看到有人踉跄地闯入马路。下一秒，那人被迎面而来的卡车侧面撞击，拖入了车底。尽管真嗣从他的位置无法看清发生了什么，但他能看出那是一幕惨状。那人被卡车甩了出来，现在无助地躺在路上。血从那人躺着的地方渗出，真嗣能清楚地看到人体组织的痕迹。尽管他告诉自己这一切都是梦，他仍然感到想吐。

"Do you see what has happened," said a quite voice behind him.  
“你看到了发生的事，”一个平静的声音在他身后说道。

He turned around in mid air to see the Asuka from his dreams. Even though she was still missing half her face she was at least standing up now and not laying in a pool of her own blood.  
他在半空中转过身，看到了梦中的那个明日香。尽管她仍缺了半张脸，但至少现在站起来了，不再躺在自己的血泊中。

"What are you doing here," Shinji asked?  
"你在这里做什么？" 真嗣问道。

"Simple, watching what just occurred."  
"简单，观察刚刚发生的事情。"

"What do you mea-" "你是什么意——"

Next second Shinji found himself next to the body of the person who had just been dragged under the car. Shinji now felt his lungs collapse inside of him. Asuka was lying face up on the pavement with a blank, dead look in her eyes. Just like the one standing next to him this one had the side of her face torn off and an eye ball was hanging loosely over the side. Shinji now guessed what had happened to her fingers and saw that the skin had been shredded off thanks to the tires of the car.  
下一秒，真嗣发现自己站在刚刚被拖到车下的人旁边。真嗣此刻感到自己的肺仿佛在体内崩塌。明日香仰面躺在人行道上，眼中毫无生气，死寂一片。就像站在他身边的这个一样，她的半边脸被撕裂，眼球松松地挂在一边。真嗣现在猜到了她的手指发生了什么，看到皮肤被车轮撕碎。

Shinji continued to stare back into the eyes of the now dead Asuka. It was amazing how red her hair was now with half her skull missing. Shinji now saw that his physical self had rushed over, horror struck and was now weeping over her lifeless body.  
真嗣继续凝视着已经死去的明日香的双眼。她的头发在失去半个头骨后依然红得惊人。真嗣看到自己的身体冲了过来，惊恐万分，现在正对着她毫无生气的身体哭泣。

"Is this what you want," asked the Asuka next to him.  
“这就是你想要的吗？”他身边的明日香问道。

Shinji turned with a saddened look on his face. Looking back down at the corpse before him and said, "This is what will happen if I don't save her."  
真嗣转过身来，脸上带着悲伤的表情。他再次低头看着眼前的尸体，说道：“如果我不救她，这就是将会发生的事。”

The Asuka next to him nodded.  
他身边的明日香点了点头。

Shinji felt like he was about to break down from the sheer stress of what was happening to him. "What are these...these, visions? Why is this happening to me of all people?"  
真嗣感到自己快要被这突如其来的压力击垮了。“这些……这些，幻象是什么？为什么偏偏是我要经历这些？”

"I can't answer that," said Asuka. "I'm merely here to help you along in the beginning. What you decide to do afterward is your decision. Though I will say this. Your decision affects the lives of people around you. Whether this is a gift or a curse is entirely up to you. You can simply ignore what can happen, or what will happen."  
"我无法回答这个问题，" 明日香说，"我只是在这里帮助你起步。之后你决定做什么，是你自己的选择。不过我要提醒你，你的决定会影响到你周围人的生活。这是福是祸，全在于你。你可以选择忽视可能发生或将会发生的事情。"

"Are you suggesting that I'm able to see the future."  
"你是说我有预见未来的能力吗？"

"That seems to be the case. I don't know much about it myself. Though it seems that you are able to see the future of people who are close to you. You can't look into any random person's future and alter it to your desire."  
"看起来似乎是这样。我自己对此了解不多。不过似乎你能预见到与你亲近之人的未来。你无法随意窥探任何人的未来并按你的意愿改变它。"

Shinji was silent for a while before he sat down on the curb. Putting his hand up to his face he touched it gently and then lowered it to the now dead Asuka. "Is this what can happen or what will happen if I don't stop it."  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，然后坐在路缘上。他把手举到脸上，轻轻触碰，随后放到了已经死去的明日香身上。“这是可能发生的事，还是如果我不阻止就会发生的事。”

"Altering the future can be both dangerous for the person altering it and the person that is being altered by it. It is entirely up to you whether you do it or not."  
“改变未来对改变者和被改变者都可能很危险。是否这么做完全取决于你。”

"What is your suggestion?"  
“你有什么建议？”

"It doesn't matter to me either way. I have already died thanks to you. But it was planned that way also. This is simply an alternate reality that in which you chose to ignore the visions and continue on with your life. I'll admit that the end result wasn't pretty. You blamed yourself for killing me and in turn killed yourself. Humans can be rather pathetic."  
"对我来说都无所谓。我已经因为你而死了。但这也在计划之中。这只是你选择忽视预知并继续生活的另一个现实。我得承认，结果并不美好。你因害死我而自责，最终也自杀了。人类有时真是可悲。"

Shinji now looked up at the Asuka before him and frowned, "Who are you really."  
真嗣抬头看着眼前的明日香，皱起眉头，"你到底是谁。"

"Hmm well your not as dumb as you look. No I'm not Asuka. I'm simply taking her form so its easier to speak with you. She will have gone on by now."  
"嗯，看来你没看起来那么笨。不，我不是明日香。我只是借用她的形象，这样和你交流更方便。她现在已经离开了。"

Shinji frowned. He had so many things that he wanted to ask this pseudo Asuka but thought it was time to return to his own place.  
真嗣皱了皱眉。他有太多问题想问这个假明日香，但觉得是时候回到自己的地方了。

"How do I get back."  
“我怎么回去？”

The fake Asuka smirked and said, "However you want to."  
假明日香轻蔑地笑了笑，说：“随你高兴。”

---

All this happened in the span of seconds and Shinji continued to walk behind Asuka. 'That was interesting, though I'll save my worries later I need to decide what I want to do.' Though did he really have to think about that. Sure Asuka could be a complete pain to be around when she was in a bitchy mood. But Shinji still liked to be around her. 'I feel so stupid about having second thoughts about this, fuck I'm a coward.'  
这一切在几秒钟内发生，真嗣继续跟在明日香后面走着。'虽然那很有趣，但我还是把担忧留到以后吧，我需要决定自己想做什么。' 不过，他真的需要考虑这个吗？当然，明日香在心情不好时可能会完全是个麻烦。但真嗣仍然喜欢和她在一起。'我对这个有疑虑感到很愚蠢，该死，我真是个懦夫。'

"Hey Shinji come on lets cross here."  
嘿，真嗣，快点，我们在这里过马路吧。

Shinji looked around at where she was pointing. She was pointing to the other side of the street.  
真嗣环顾四周，看向她指的地方。她指的是街的另一边。

"C'mon baka Shinji if we cross here we can skip the next intersection. Besides," she said looking up and down the road, "their aren't any cars coming so this is the perfect chance."  
"来吧，笨蛋真嗣，如果我们从这里穿过去，就可以跳过下一个路口。而且，" 她上下打量着马路，"没有车过来，这是绝佳的机会。"

"Asuka, wait we shouldn't jaywalk."  
"明日香，等等，我们不应该乱穿马路。"

"Oh calm yourself. Your acting like the First Child." Asuka took a step off the curve and down onto the pavement. However the top of her sandal caught the edge of the curve and she stumbled forward before falling down to her knees. She was now in the lane of traffic closest to the curve.  
"哦，冷静点。你表现得像个第一适格者似的。" 明日香迈出一步，从路缘石上踏到人行道上。然而，她的凉鞋顶部勾住了路缘石的边缘，她踉跄着向前扑倒，双膝着地。她现在位于离路缘石最近的行车道上。

"FUCK, NO ASUKA," Shinji screamed.  
"操，不，明日香，" 真嗣尖叫道。

To Shinji's right he heard the roar of an engine. Turning around for a split second he saw a bright blue truck come skidding around the corner of the side street and pull onto the main street.  
在真嗣的右边，他听到了引擎的轰鸣声。转过身来的一瞬间，他看到一辆亮蓝色的卡车从侧街的拐角处滑行过来，驶上了主街。

'GOD FUCKING DAMNIT,' screamed Shinji in his head.  
'该死的，' 真嗣在心里咆哮。

Darting off the sidewalk with the eyes of every bystander on him he dove to Asuka as the truck was getting closer.  
他从人行道上疾驰而出，所有旁观者的目光都集中在他身上，他向着越来越近的卡车冲向明日香。

"ASUKA GOD DAMNIT GET UP," yelled Shinji at her as he grabbed her arm. Asuka however had frozen when she saw the truck, engine blaring, coming to great her.  
“明日香，该死的快起来！”真嗣朝她大喊，抓住她的手臂。然而明日香在看到那辆引擎轰鸣、疾驰而来的卡车时，整个人都僵住了。

"FUCK IT," yelled Shinji. Grabbing her arm he pulled her as hard as he could and practically picked her up, holding onto one of her arms. Summoning strength that he didn't know he had he jumped from the middle of the lane and landed haphazardly onto the edge of the curve. He heard the truck whiz by but knew that if he fell backwards with him holding her the way he was she could likely suffer a serious concussion, or worse.  
“去他的！”真嗣大喊一声，紧紧抓住她的手臂，用尽全力将她拉起，几乎是将她拎了起来，只靠一只手臂支撑。他爆发出自己都不知道的力量，从车道中央一跃而起，狼狈地落在弯道边缘。他听到卡车呼啸而过，但知道如果自己向后倒下，以他现在的姿势抱着她，她很可能会遭受严重的脑震荡，甚至更糟。

Instead he forced himself to lean forward and felt his foot slip off the edge of the side walk and crashed down hard on the side of his face. Almost immediately he heard a low thump as Asuka fell on top of him also.  
相反，他强迫自己向前倾，感觉到脚从人行道边缘滑落，重重地摔在了脸颊一侧。几乎立刻，他就听到一声低沉的撞击声，因为明日香也倒在了他身上。

Shinji felt blood building up inside of his mouth but ignored it. He had something else he had to worry about. Pushing himself up he found Asuka shaking uncontrollably on his chest.  
真嗣感觉到嘴里积聚着血，但他忽略了它。他有其他需要担心的事情。他撑起自己，发现明日香在他胸前颤抖不已。

"Asuka are you-" “明日香，你还好吗-”

But then he was lost for words as she broke down crying on his chest. Mouth wide open in surprise Shinji didn't know what to say in a situation like this. "Asuka," he swallowed, "its okay, everything is fine."  
但随后他便语塞了，因为她在他胸前崩溃大哭。真嗣惊讶得嘴巴大张，不知在这种情况下该说什么。“明日香，”他咽了咽口水，“没事的，一切都好。”

She shook her head and continued to cry even harder. Shinji now looked up and saw many worried faces looking back at him and her.  
她摇了摇头，哭得更厉害了。真嗣抬头望去，看到许多担忧的面孔正回望着他和她。

"Good God that was a fright, are you okay kid," said an elderly gentlemen.  
“天哪，真是吓人一跳，你还好吗，孩子？”一位老先生说道。

Shinji nodded and looked back at Asuka who he realized now had pushed herself off his chest and was starring wide eyed at everyone gathered their.  
真嗣点点头，回头看向明日香，他这时才意识到她已经从他胸前推开，正瞪大眼睛看着聚集在那里的每个人。

"No...no...," she whispered.  
“不……不……”她低声呢喃。

Shinji was worried, "Asuka what are you?" But then he froze when she screamed out loud.  
真嗣担心地问：“明日香，你怎么了？”但随即他僵住了，因为她大声尖叫起来。

"ASUKA!" "明日香！"

She had stood up quickly and had taken off down the sidewalk.  
她迅速站起身，沿着人行道飞奔而去。

"ASUKA WAIT." "明日香，等等。"

Asuka however continued to sprint as fast as she could. 'No...No...NO! I've been poisoned. I let people see my weakness. I can't let them know how weak I truly am. Least of all Shinji. How could I have used him as a sponge to cry my eyes out. I feel dirty. WHY AM I STILL ALIVE.'  
然而，明日香依旧竭尽全力地奔跑着。'不...不...不！我中毒了。我让人看到了我的弱点。我不能让他们知道我有多么脆弱。尤其是真嗣。我怎么能把他当作擦泪的海绵呢。我感觉肮脏。为什么我还活着？'

'Because he saved you,' said a small voice in her head.  
'因为他救了你，'她脑海中有个细小的声音说道。

'I didn't ask him to,' she retorted.  
'我没让他这么做，'她反驳道。

'Yet he did anyway.' '但他还是这么做了。'

'NO I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. I DON'T NEED ANYBODY ELSE.'  
'不，我能照顾好自己。我不需要任何人。'

'Could you have saved yourself if you weren't so afraid.'  
'如果不是因为害怕，你能自救吗？'

'I would rather die then rely on anybody. Least of all that coward.'  
'我宁愿死也不愿依赖任何人。尤其是那个懦夫。'

'Yet he wasn't a coward. He risked his own life to save you.'  
'但他并非懦夫。他冒着生命危险来救你。'

'STOP IT. GET OUT OF MY MIND.'  
'住口。从我脑海中滚出去。'

---

Soon Shinji had lost sight of Asuka and was leaning against a light post breath heavily. While he had ran he discovered that several teeth had been knocked loose and that they were hanging by little more than his gums. The blood was still flowing freely in his mouth and he had to spit every few seconds to keeping the saltiness out of his mouth.  
不久，真嗣便看不见明日香的身影了，他靠在一根路灯杆上，喘着粗气。在奔跑的过程中，他发现自己有几颗牙齿松动了，几乎只是靠牙龈勉强挂着。血仍在嘴里自由流淌，他不得不每隔几秒就吐一口，以保持嘴里没有咸味。

'Damn it Asuka. Why were you so afraid all the sudden?'  
“该死的明日香。你为什么突然这么害怕？”

Shinji soon willed himself to move off of the light post and continued running back to Misato's apartment where he was sure Asuka had gone.  
真嗣很快强迫自己离开路灯杆，继续跑回美里小姐的公寓，他确信明日香已经去了那里。

---

When Shinji opened the door he was glad to notice that her shoes were at least laying there. Though it looked as though she had thrown them across the floor when she had come in.  
当真嗣打开门时，他很高兴至少看到她的鞋子摆在那里。不过看起来她进来时像是把它们扔过地板似的。

He took his own shoes off and walked slowly inside. "Asuka," he said quietly.  
他脱下自己的鞋子，慢慢地走了进去。“明日香，”他轻声说道。

He didn't get a response back and walked inside a little further. Turning toward her door he knocked softly. "Asuka...are you there."  
他没有得到回应，又往里走了几步。转向她的房门，他轻轻地敲了敲。“明日香...你在吗？”

Again he didn't get an answer. Feeling a little worried he opened the door a little and peeked his head in. "Asuka?"  
他又没有得到回答。感到有些担心，他轻轻推开门，探头进去。“明日香？”

He was greeted with something being thrown at him. Though it missed his head it shattered close to it and Shinji felt something sharp scrape the side of his face. He pulled back his head quickly and shut the door as something else shattered against it. 'Damn, why the fuck is she acting like this. I just saved her life didn't I. She could at least show a little gratitude.'  
迎接他的是一个飞来的物体。虽然没砸中他的头，却在附近碎裂，真嗣感到脸颊一侧被什么尖锐的东西划过。他迅速缩回头，关上门，又有什么东西在门上碎裂。“该死，她到底为什么这样发疯。我不是救了她一命吗？她至少可以表现出一点感激之情吧。”

Shinji now walked away but stop dead in his tracks when a fleeting image of Asuka choking herself with some twine appeared in his mind.  
真嗣转身离开，但突然停下脚步，脑海中闪过明日香用细绳勒住自己脖子的画面。

"Its your fault Shinji, I can't let anyone know how weak I am. Least of all you."  
"这都是你的错，真嗣，我不能让任何人知道我有多脆弱。尤其是你。"

Without thinking he turned around and flung open the door to her room. Ignoring the fact that something else was aimed at his head he darted toward where she was, curled up in a corner with something that looked like a stuffed bear in her hands.  
他未经思考便转过身，猛地推开她房间的门。无视着有东西正瞄准他的头部，他冲向她所在的地方，只见她蜷缩在角落里，手里抱着一个看起来像毛绒熊的东西。

"NO DON'T COME NEAR ME," she shrieked as she tried to push herself farther back into the corner  
"不，不要靠近我，""她尖叫着，试图将自己更深地挤进角落里。

Shinji ignored her and looked at her carefully, then swore in his mind. He remembered what the fake Asuka had said about not relying to much on the visions. Sometimes they were only things that could happen, not things that would happen. Relaxing slightly he let out a deep breath and looked at her more closely. It seemed that she had gotten back slightly ahead of him. Her hair was a greasy mess from her sweat and it hung in great bunches around her face. She still had the red shirt and dark blue jeans on, though he saw that certain parts had stains on them.  
真嗣无视了她，仔细地打量着她，然后在心里咒骂了一声。他想起了假明日香关于不要太依赖幻象的忠告。有时候，那些只是可能发生的事情，而不是一定会发生的。他稍微放松了一些，深吸一口气，更仔细地看着她。似乎她已经稍微领先于他了。她的头发因为汗水而变得油腻凌乱，大团地垂在脸颊周围。她仍然穿着那件红色衬衫和深蓝色牛仔裤，尽管他注意到某些部分有污渍。

She still seemed nervous and had an afraid look in her eyes. Shinji wanted to calm her down, to prevent himself from seeing any more horrendous images appearing in his mind. Instead he sat down a few feet in front of her. This was the first time that he had been in her room and he looked around now at it. It was much cleaner than his and he saw that many of the things that she had came from Germany. She had hung several posters on her walls depicting famous artists. Shinji didn't recognized any of them though, he was more into the classics.  
她看起来仍然很紧张，眼中流露出害怕的神情。真嗣想让她平静下来，以免脑海中再出现更多可怕的画面。相反，他在她面前几英尺处坐下。这是他第一次进入她的房间，他现在环顾四周。这里比他的房间干净得多，他看到她的许多东西都来自德国。她在墙上挂了几张著名艺术家的海报。真嗣一个也不认识，他更喜欢古典艺术。

Turning his gaze back to her he saw that she had calmed down slightly but was now giving him a death glare. Truthfully Shinji preferred the hard ass Asuka instead of the frightened one. It didn't suit her.  
他转回视线看向她，发现她已经稍微平静了一些，但此刻正对他投以死亡凝视。说实话，真嗣更喜欢那个强硬的明日香，而不是那个惊慌失措的她。那不适合她。

Feeling that she was doing better he said quietly, "Asuka...are you okay?"  
感觉到她状态有所好转，他轻声问道：“明日香……你还好吗？”

She inhaled deeply and grabbed the nearest pillow and flung it at Shinji's face. Shinji didn't even care. The fact that she had reacted was all that he cared for. "Asuk-"  
她深吸一口气，抓起最近的枕头朝真嗣的脸扔去。真嗣根本不在意。她有所反应的事实才是他在乎的。“明日香——”

But now she tackled him to the floor and was now beating her fists repeatedly on his chest. "Damn you Shinji. Damn you, damn you damn you."  
但她此刻却将他扑倒在地，拳头如雨点般落在他的胸膛。“该死的真嗣。该死的，该死的该死的。”

Shinji continued to look up at her ceiling while she continued to pound his chest. Soon the punches became less frequent and with less power. Then she had seised hitting him and had pushed herself off of him and moved back to the corner.  
真嗣继续仰望着天花板，而她依旧捶打着他的胸口。渐渐地，拳击的频率和力度都减弱了。随后，她停止了击打，从他身上撑起，退回到角落里。

Shinji continue to stare at the wall waiting for her to reply. "Why did you do that?"  
真嗣继续盯着墙壁，等待她的回应。“你为什么要那样做？”

Shinji thought this was the stupidest question in the world. What was he supposed to, just stand there in shock as she died? He didn't think he could take seeing her die for a second time.  
真嗣觉得这是世界上最愚蠢的问题。难道他应该怎么做，就站在那里震惊地看着她死去吗？他觉得他无法承受再次目睹她死去。

"Do you honestly think that I could have watched that happen."  
"你真的认为我能眼睁睁看着那种事情发生吗。"

"But...I always seem to get on your nerves. Why would you risk yourself to protect someone like me?"  
"但是...我总是惹你生气。你为什么要冒着生命危险去保护像我这样的人呢？"

Shinji wasn't about to tell her about his visions. He didn't need her thinking that he was some sort of freak. "Do I need a reason. If I was to stand their and watch it would have been the same as killing you myself. I was able to save you and I took that."  
真嗣并不打算告诉她自己的那些幻觉。他不需要她认为自己是个怪胎。“我需要理由吗？如果我站在那里看着，那和亲手杀了你有什么区别。我救了你，我抓住了那个机会。”

"But I didn't want you to," she almost yelled. "I feel so disgusting...like vomiting. I was held by you GOD DAMNIT. I CRIED INTO YOUR CHEST. I WAS WEAK!"  
“但我并不想让你救我，”她几乎是在喊。“我感觉恶心……想吐。我被你抱住了，该死的。我哭着靠在你胸前。我太软弱了！”

"Is that what this is about? You felt weak. Asuka your one of the strongest people I know. Being able to pilot something like the Eva's is an inhuman task. When I piloted it...for that time, I felt like I was losing my mind. It was so disgusting floating in that damn liquid that smells so much like blood. I kept willing myself not to vomit every time I felt the bile coming up my throat. And you've been doing this full time, how could you call yourself weak. If anything I'm the weak one."  
“这就是问题的关键吗？你觉得软弱。明日香，你是我认识的最坚强的人之一。驾驶像 Eva 这样的东西是非人的任务。当我驾驶它……那段时间，我感觉自己快要疯了。漂浮在那股血腥味浓重的液体里，太恶心了。每次感到胆汁涌上喉咙，我都拼命忍住不吐。而你一直在全职做这件事，你怎么能说自己软弱呢。要说的话，我才是不够坚强的人。”

Asuka was silent. Shinji hadn't talked about his experience inside the Eva since he had been released from the hospital. It was always something that she and Misato knew that he would never talk about freely. "Shinji...do you plan on ever piloting Eva again."  
明日香沉默了。真嗣自从出院后，就再也没有谈及他在 Eva 中的经历。她和美里都知道，他永远不会自由地谈论这些。“真嗣……你打算再次驾驶 Eva 吗？”

Shinji didn't even have to think of that. "No, I can't, not for anything. I don't want to put myself in something as...demonic I guess, ever again."  
真嗣甚至不需要思考这个问题。“不，我做不到，无论如何都不行。我不想再让自己陷入那种……可以说是恶魔般的存在中了。”

"But the Eva's are supposed to be used to save mankind from the Angels."  
“但 Eva 本应被用来拯救人类免受使徒的威胁。”

"Yet what are the Angels. Why do they attack us? What have we done wrong."  
“然而天使是什么？他们为何攻击我们？我们做错了什么？”

Asuka was silent. It was something she never worried about. Though now that he brought it up she wondered also what the purpose of them could be. She knew about the possibilities of Third Impact and that the Angels were trying to initiate it.  
明日香沉默了。这是她从未担心过的问题。不过现在他提起了，她也想知道天使存在的目的。她知道第三次冲击的可能性，以及天使们试图引发它。

Now though she saw that Shinji had moved closer to her and was bending over her legs. Immediately she became defensive and said, "What the fuck are you doing. You better not being try to take a peek up my pant legs, because if you are I'l-"  
然而现在，她看到真嗣向她靠近，弯腰在她腿边。她立刻变得警觉，说道：“你在干什么？你最好不要试图偷看我的裙底，否则我可要——”

"Oh shut it Asuka," said Shinji forcefully.  
"哦，闭嘴吧，明日香，" 真嗣强硬地说道。

Asuka did, though it was because of her surprise. She had hardly heard Shinji snap back at her. Now though she asked in a more polite voice, "What are you doing then baka?"  
明日香确实闭嘴了，但这只是因为她感到惊讶。她几乎没听过真嗣对她反唇相讥。不过现在她用更礼貌的语气问道，"那你到底在干什么，笨蛋？"

"You probably never realized it, but when you fell you scraped your knees." Shinji was looking at her pant legs now and saw that where the knees were was a little damp.  
"你可能从未注意到，但你摔倒时擦伤了膝盖。" 真嗣现在正盯着她的裤腿看，发现膝盖处有点潮湿。

"Asuka can I have you roll up your pant legs to your knees?"  
“明日香，你能把裤腿卷到膝盖上吗？”

She threw him a scowl but complied. "You better not try anything suspicious are you'll be on your stomach gasping for air."  
她瞪了他一眼，但还是照做了。“你最好别动什么歪脑筋，否则你就得趴在地上喘不过气来。”

Shinji ignored her comment and looked down at her knees. The blood had dried in certain areas but was still flowing slightly. "We'll have to staunch this and wrap it up with something."  
真嗣没理会她的警告，低头看着她的膝盖。血在一些地方已经凝固，但仍有轻微流出。“我们得先止血，然后用东西包扎一下。”

"Don't you mean I," said Asuka standing up. "I'm not letting you touch me anymore than you have to hentai."  
"你是指'我'吧，" 明日香站起来说道。"我不会让你再碰我，除非必要，变态。"

Shinji scowled at her but sighed and stood up. "Fine do what ever you want. But clean that soon or it could get infected. Misato might not be coming back for a while so I'm gonna start dinner now."  
真嗣对她皱了皱眉，但还是叹了口气站起来。"好吧，随你便。但尽快清理干净，不然可能会感染。美里可能一时半会儿回不来，我要开始做晚饭了。"

"Fine do whatever you want."  
"好吧，随你便。"

Asuka turned and walked out into the hallway and turned into the bathroom. Poking her head back out she said with a slight grin on her face, "And don't you dare try to catch anything."  
明日香转过身，走出走廊，拐进了浴室。她探出头来，脸上带着一丝狡黠的笑容说：“你可别想抓住什么。”

"As if I would," said Shinji.  
“我才不会呢，”真嗣说。

---

Shinji was standing over the stove now with the pot that was sending steam out. He didn't care what Asuka said, he wanted something Japanese for once instead of constant German food. 'As long as she doesn't have to cook she doesn't care anyway. But really, through all the talking we just did she never thanked me once. Maybe she doesn't have a heart maybe its just a black hole of some sorts.'  
真嗣现在站在炉子旁，锅里的蒸汽不断冒出。他不在乎明日香说什么，他只想吃一次日本料理，而不是一直吃德国菜。‘只要她不用做饭，她才不在乎呢。但说真的，我们刚才聊了那么多，她一次也没谢过我。也许她没有心，也许那只是某种黑洞。’

Shinji now turned off the stove and took the pot with the cooked rice in it. Putting the rice in together with the beef and vegetables he tossed the food together so that the peanut oil he had used mixed with the rice so that it gave it a little more flavor. Stir fry's were some of Shinji's favorite meals.  
真嗣现在关掉了炉子，拿起装着煮熟米饭的锅。他将米饭与牛肉和蔬菜一起翻炒，让之前使用的花生油与米饭混合，增添了一丝风味。炒饭是真嗣最喜欢的菜肴之一。

"Smells like something that isn't Japanese food," said a voice behind.  
“闻起来不像日本料理，”背后传来一个声音。

'Wonder who the hell that could be,' thought Shinji in mock irritation.  
“不知道那会是谁，”真嗣假装恼怒地想。

"Sorry Asuka, I wanted Japanese food today."  
"对不起，明日香，我今天想吃日本料理。"

"Whatever, since it smells good enough I don't care."  
"无所谓，既然闻起来不错，我就不介意了。"

'Figures, she didn't cook it so she doesn't care. Sometimes I wonder how the hell she survived without me there to cook for her.'  
“难怪，她没做所以不在乎。有时候我真好奇，没有我在那儿给她做饭，她是怎么活下来的。”

Turning around Shinji put the pot with everything in it on the table and put two plates on the table.  
转过身，真嗣将装满食材的锅放在桌上，并摆上了两个盘子。

"Itadakimasu," said Shinji.  
“我开动了，”真嗣说道。

Asuka simply dug right in to the food without saying any form of thank you. Shinji sighed and figured he should have been expecting this attitude.  
明日香直接开始吃起了食物，没有说任何感谢的话。真嗣叹了口气，心想自己本该料到她会是这种态度。

"What is this," said Asuka speaking up?  
"这是什么？" 明日香开口问道。

"Its a stir fry," said Shinji.  
"这是一道炒菜，" 真嗣回答道。

"Hmm, its not half bad baka."  
"嗯，还不赖，笨蛋。"

"Err, thanks Asuka." "呃，谢谢明日香。"

Asuka now looked up from her plate and put down her chopsticks.  
明日香现在从她的盘子上抬起头，放下了筷子。

"Um Shinji..." "嗯，真嗣..."

"What?" "什么？"

"I guess...well...thank you..."  
"我想...嗯...谢谢你..."

Shinji continued to look down at his plate. "...Don't mention it."  
真嗣继续低头看着他的盘子。"...不用谢。"

"You...wont mention...that to Misato will you?"  
"你...不会把...这件事告诉美里吧？"

Shinji looked up and saw that she was really worried. 'Why would she be so worried about something so trivial as that. Even me who practically shunned all human contact eventually came to realize that being around people is enjoyable and thats its okay to rely on people to help. But if she doesn't want help thats her choice. I'm not gonna force her to acknowledge anything.'  
真嗣抬头一看，发现她真的很担心。'为什么她会对这么琐碎的事情如此担心呢。就连我这个几乎回避所有人际交往的人，最终也意识到与人相处是愉快的，依靠他人帮助也是没问题的。但如果她不想接受帮助，那是她的选择。我不会强迫她承认任何事情。'

"Yeah, don't worry about it."  
“嗯，别担心。”

Asuka nodded and went back to eating  
明日香点点头，继续吃东西

Later that night Shinji lay awake in bed. Everything had happened to him today was spinning around in his head. "Why do I have this...power I guess you could call it, to see the future of people I know. Is their a reason that I've been given this. What am I supposed to do with this."  
那晚晚些时候，真嗣躺在床上辗转反侧。今天发生的一切在他脑海中盘旋。“为什么我会有这种……可以说是预知未来的能力，看到我所认识的人的未来。这是有什么原因吗？我应该用这个能力做什么。”

"You've got to find that out for yourself baka."  
“你得自己找出答案，笨蛋。”

Shinji sat bolt upright and almost screamed out. The fake Asuka was sitting on the edge of his bed smirking at him. Though Shinji was glad that she seemed to have her face back to the way it was.  
真嗣猛地坐起身，差点尖叫出来。假明日香坐在他床边，正对他冷笑。尽管真嗣很高兴她的脸似乎恢复了原样。

"Err I don't mean to be rude but what are you doing here...do I still call you Asuka or what."  
"呃，我不是有意无礼，但你在这里做什么...我还该叫你明日香吗？"

"You can, though...nah you can wait a little longer. I see that you decided to save her."  
"你可以，不过...算了，你再等一会儿吧。看来你决定救她了。"

"I don't think I couldn't have. I...hmm...it wouldn't have been right."  
"我觉得我不能不救。我...嗯...那样做不对。"

"Thats a rather lame excuse."  
"那真是个蹩脚的借口。"

"Maybe but I can't think of a better one. Just knowing that it would have been my fault would have been enough to drive me mad."  
"或许吧，但我实在想不出更好的理由。光是知道那可能是我的错，就足以让我发疯。"

"You've still got a long way's to go," said the fake Asuka standing up.  
""你还有很长的路要走，""假明日香站起身来说道。

Shinji smirked and said, "You may look like her, and I hate to say it but right down to her chest, but Asuka never would sound so philosophical."  
真嗣微微一笑，说道：“你或许外表像她，甚至胸部都一模一样，但我不得不说，明日香从不会这么哲学。”

"Maybe not, but I only know what she looks like. I haven't been around her enough to know what kind of personality she has. Though I can certainly examine your mind to find out. Would like me to?"  
“也许吧，但我只知道她的样子。我还没和她相处足够久，不了解她的性格。不过，我当然可以探查你的心思来了解。你想让我这么做吗？”

Shinji smiled, "No thats okay. Having one Asuka is enough."  
真嗣笑了笑，“不用了，有这一个明日香就够了。”

"Thats rather rude." "那样说有点不礼貌。"

"No I mean...she's unique, I guess thats the best way I can phrase that."  
"不，我是说……她很独特，我想这是我能想到的最恰当的表述了。"

"Hmph I guess, I can understand that. Well, I'm done here. Time to see what other misfortunate humans I can torture. Though I must say your decision is rather interesting."  
"哼，我想我能理解。好了，我这里结束了。该去看看还有哪些不幸的人类可以折磨了。不过我得说，你的决定相当有趣。"

"How so?" "此话怎讲？"

She simply smirked and said, "Oh you'll find out soon enough."  
她只是微微一笑，说道：“哦，你很快就会知道了。”

He blinked and she was gone which left him to wonder if it was nothing more than a dream or if he had really just talked to...whoever she was.  
他眨了眨眼，她已消失无踪，留下他独自疑惑，这究竟是一场梦，还是他真的与那位——无论她是谁——交谈过。

### Chapter 4: Decide

**...I'M BACk..for now. Sorry bout the wait. In my defense I'll say that its hard to right a story like this and I have to be in a particular mood to get everything across. Anyway I'm hoping to work on this more so expect updates more frequently. (instead of four month's like this time) So for all those people that thought I died or abandoned this I apologize. I never abandon my stories, no matter how long it takes to get them done, I will get them done. And...I'm done  
……我回来了……暂时。抱歉让大家久等了。我得辩解一下，写这样的故事确实很难，我必须得在特定的心情下才能把一切都表达出来。无论如何，我希望今后能更频繁地更新（不像这次隔了四个月）。所以，对于那些以为我死了或者放弃了这个故事的人，我深表歉意。我从不放弃我的故事，无论需要多长时间完成，我都会完成它们。而且……我说完了。**

---

Shinji sat bolt upright on his futon, breathing heavily as though he had just ran a mile. Rubbing his temples wearily he let out a low sigh and tried to remember what he had just dreamt.  
真嗣笔直地坐在他的被褥上，呼吸急促，仿佛刚跑完一英里。他疲惫地揉着太阳穴，发出一声低叹，试图回忆起他刚刚梦见了什么。

Again, he suspected, that it had to do with the random visions that he had been having. Most of them, with the exception of Asuka's, had been completely irrelevant. This one though confused him.  
他再次怀疑，这与他近期频繁出现的幻觉有关。除了关于明日香的那些，大多数幻觉都毫无关联。但这次的幻觉却让他困惑不已。

In it, he was standing in the middle of a large crater, in the center of Tokyo 3. Around him many corpses of people that he had no affiliation with. However in the middle of it all was Eva Unit 01.  
在幻觉中，他站在一个巨大的弹坑中央，位于第三新东京市的中心。周围散布着许多与他无关的人的尸体。然而，在这片混乱的中心，是 Eva 初号机。

Shinji had stood there for a good while before he walked slowly over to what remained of the unit. The entry plug was laying a good few yards away from it and as he slowly approached it he realized that an arm was dangling out of it. Now running towards, it he pried it open as best he could. From what he could see from the small opening that he had made a girl laid inside.  
真嗣在那里站了好一会儿，才慢慢走向残存的初号机。驾驶舱插栓躺在离它几码远的地方，当他缓缓靠近时，他发现有一只手臂从里面垂挂出来。他立刻跑向那里，尽可能地用力打开插栓。从他打开的小缝隙中，他看到一个女孩躺在里面。

At this point Shinji felt nauseous, not necessarily from the fact that another child was forced to fight in the demonic Eva's, but more of the fact that her left side was torn apart, leaving brain matter hanging out of the side of her skull. From what he could see, apart from all the blood, was that she had light blue hair.  
此时，真嗣感到一阵恶心，并非完全因为另一个孩子被迫驾驶恶魔般的 EVA，而是更因为她的左侧被撕裂，脑浆从颅侧溢出。从他所见，除了满地的血迹外，她的头发是淡蓝色的。

Shinji had then put out a hand grab her wrist and see if she had a pulse. At this point the dying pilot had grabbed his hand forcefully and her eyes had flown open, revealing two blood red globes looking back at him. Shinji had attempted to wrench free of her grip but she simply frowned back at him and whispered, "Why did you let everyone die?"  
真嗣随即伸出手去抓她的手腕，想确认她是否有脉搏。就在这时，垂死的驾驶员猛地抓住他的手，双眼突然睁开，露出两颗血红色的眼球盯着他。真嗣试图挣脱她的握力，但她只是皱着眉头，低声问道：“为什么你让大家都死了？”

---

Shinji had then turned shakily around to see everybody that he had ever met, piled in a bloody heap behind him. It was thanks to this last part that he had sat bolt upright in his futon. Seeing Asuka and Misato torn to shreds was not something that he didn't consider pleasant. Then again, who would?  
真嗣随后颤抖着转身，看到他曾遇见的每一个人都堆叠在他身后，血肉模糊。正是这一幕让他猛地从被褥中坐起。看到明日香和美里被撕成碎片，绝非他所认为的愉快景象。再者，谁又能接受这样的场面呢？

Forcing himself to sit up, he trudged to the bathroom, willing himself not to vomit until he reached the toilet. Several minutes later he had his back to the bathroom door as he had just thrown up a large portion of the stir fry that he had made. Grimacing at the taste of bile he looked down at his hands and realized they were shaking.  
他强迫自己坐起来，拖着沉重的步伐走向浴室，心里不断告诉自己要撑到马桶前再吐。几分钟后，他背靠着浴室门，刚刚吐出了大部分自己做的炒菜。他皱着眉头，对胆汁的味道感到厌恶，低头看着自己的手，发现它们在颤抖。

What confused him most about this dream, or vision, was that the blue haired girl with red eyes had never met him, as far as he could remember. He thought that only people that he had met before, or were always around were people that he would have the visions for.  
这个梦，或者说幻象，最让他困惑的是，那个蓝发红眼的女孩，就他所记得的，从未见过他。他原以为只有那些他之前见过或经常在身边的人，才会出现在他的幻象中。

Leaning his head back against he bathroom door he banged it lightly against it. 'I'm really going insane, aren't I?' He paused, as he fully expected someone to answer him. Without any kind of confirmation to his sanity he open the bathroom door and walked slowly back to his futon, where he immediately fell down and fell asleep.  
他后仰着头靠在浴室门上，轻轻地敲了敲门。'我真的要疯了，不是吗？'他停顿了一下，满心期待有人会回答他。在没有得到任何关于他理智的确认后，他打开浴室门，慢慢走回自己的蒲团，立刻倒下并睡着了。

Shinji walked slowly into the kitchen the next morning already to find Asuka and Misato sitting there, chatting animately. Though when Shinji walked in Asuka frowned at him for a minute before turning back towards Misato.  
第二天早上，真嗣缓缓走进厨房，发现明日香和美里已经坐在那里，正热烈地聊着。然而，当真嗣走进来时，明日香皱着眉头看了他一会儿，然后又转向美里。

In truth Shinji didn't feel that good. Even though he had fallen asleep instantly last night after his dream, he had a splitting headache this morning. Misato therefore realized this, as she watched Shinji try to put the cereal back in the fridge.  
实际上，真嗣感觉并不好。尽管昨晚他一躺下就立刻睡着了，但今早醒来却头痛欲裂。美里注意到了这一点，因为她看到真嗣试图把麦片放回冰箱。

"Err Shinji, are you okay?"  
“呃，真嗣，你还好吗？”

"Yeah, I'm fine, just a little tired is all."  
"嗯，我没事，只是有点累而已。"

Misato frowned at him and said, "No your not, you've got bags under your eyes as if you didn't sleep last night." Standing up she walked over to Shinji and put a hand to his forehead. "You've got a fever, Shinji."  
美里皱着眉头对他说：“不，你看起来可不像没事，你眼睛下面都有黑眼圈了，好像昨晚没睡一样。”她站起来走到真嗣身边，把手放在他的额头上。“你发烧了，真嗣。”

"Well, I suppose that explains why I feel like shit," murmured Shinji. Sighing he sat down at the table then and rested his head on the table.  
"好吧，我想这解释了为什么我感觉这么糟糕，“真嗣低声说。叹了口气，他坐到桌边，把头靠在桌子上。

"Shinji your gonna stay home from school."  
"真嗣，你今天不用去学校了。"

Shinji smirked, 'Fantastic.'  
真嗣微微一笑，'太棒了。'

"And Asuka will stay and take care of you," she finished.  
"明日香会留下来照顾你，"她补充道。"

'Not fantastic,' Shinji corrected. Thankfully that didn't seem to be the case, as Asuka stood up quickly and threw Shinji a scowl. Picking up her plate she dumped it in the sink, turned around and walked towards the front door.  
“不算太好，”真嗣纠正道。幸好这似乎不是实情，因为明日香迅速站起身，向真嗣投去一个怒视。她拿起自己的盘子，扔进水槽，转身走向前门。

"Asuka-" Asuka walked outside and slammed the door, "-wait." Misato stood there for a minute with an annoyed look on her face but started slightly as she felt a hand on her shoulder.  
“明日香——”明日香走出屋外，砰地一声关上门，“——等等。”美里站在那里，脸上带着恼怒的表情，但随即微微一惊，感到有人搭上了她的肩膀。

"Don't worry about it, Misato. I've taken care of myself my entire life so one day isn't going to make a difference. Besides I think I'd get worse if Asuka took care of me. Probably poison me or something."  
“别担心，美里。我一生都是自己照顾自己，一天不会有什么差别的。再说，如果让明日香来照顾我，我可能会更惨。说不定会给我下毒什么的。”

"She may dislike you but thats going far even for her."  
"她可能不喜欢你，但这也太过分了，连她都不会这么做。"

Shinji thought that it was a lot more than just dislike but didn't feel like saying anything.  
真嗣认为这不仅仅是讨厌，但他不想说什么。

"Well, Shinji, if you think that you'll be fine on your own that I guess that I'll try not to worry. I'd stay home myself but I've got to work at Nerv."  
"好吧，真嗣，如果你觉得自己一个人没问题，那我想我尽量不担心。我本来想待在家里，但我得去 NERV 工作。"

"Thanks, Misato." "谢谢你，美里。"

Misato smiled then and patted Shinji gently on the shoulder and then walked out the door.  
美里随即微笑着，轻轻拍了拍真嗣的肩膀，然后走出了房门。

Shinji would have gladly liked to tell her how much it ment to him that she had considered staying home with him but found that something was stuck in his throat. Wheeling around he decided that the best course of action was to try and force himself to get some sleep.  
真嗣本想告诉她，她考虑留在家陪他对他来说意义重大，却发现喉咙里像是哽住了什么。他转过身，决定最好的办法是强迫自己试着入睡。

---

At school, Asuka was bored to the limit. Everything that the teacher was talking about she had already learned. Several times she had turned around to make some comment about the stupidity of the teacher, only to remember that Shinji was at home sick.  
在学校，明日香无聊到了极点。老师讲的那些内容她早已学过。她几次转过身来，想对老师的愚蠢发表些评论，却突然记起真嗣因病在家。

'Tch, probably forced himself to throw up so he could skip school. Sick fuck,' she thought with a grimace. Even so without him here she was bored. At least he wasn't like all the other boys in the class, who seemed to get disgusting thoughts every time she walked in front of them. Though she was torn away from her thoughts to find a very disgusting reality awaiting him.  
“切，八成是自己逼着吐了，好逃学。病态的家伙，”她皱着眉头想。即便如此，没有他在，她还是感到无聊。至少他不像班上其他男生那样，每次她从他们面前走过时，似乎都会产生恶心的念头。尽管她的思绪被拉回，发现一个非常恶心的现实在等着他。

"Oh yes," yes said the teacher as he saw the door opening. "I had forgotten that you would be returning today."  
“哦，是的，”老师看到门打开时说道，“我忘了你今天会回来。”

Asuka narrowed her eyes to those of a hawk as she saw the light blue haired girl with red eyes walk in.  
明日香眯起眼睛，锐利如鹰，看着那个有着淡蓝色头发、红色眼睛的女孩走了进来。

"As I'm sure everyone remembers Ayanami Rei, I see no reason in reintroducing her. Anyway Ayanami, go ahead and take your usual seat."  
“我相信大家都记得绫波零，所以没必要再介绍她了。总之，绫波，去坐你平常的座位吧。”

At this Asuka had spun around to look around the room, only to find out that the only empty desk was the one next to hers.  
听到这话，明日香转过身来环视教室，却发现唯一空着的座位就在她旁边。

'This day just keeps getting shittier and shittier,' she thought as Ayanami sat down next to her.  
'今天真是越来越糟糕了，'她想着，当绫波坐在她旁边时。

---

'Where am I?' '我在哪儿？'

'_Where else but where you truly belong.'_  
'除了你真正属于的地方，还能是哪儿呢。'

It was then that Shinji inhaled a large amount of fluid. He felt like he was going to drown but next second realized that he was floating in LCL fluid and felt his body relax as oxygen filled his lungs.  
就在那时，真嗣吸入了一大口液体。他感觉自己快要溺水了，但下一秒意识到自己正漂浮在 LCL 液体中，随着氧气充满肺部，他的身体放松了下来。

The first thing he realized that he was naked as he floated helplessly, though that didn't seem to bother him. Around him was total blackness and he tried to spin around to look below him. Finding out that he was unable to move he continued looking up, where it all looked the same.  
他首先意识到自己赤身裸体地无助漂浮着，尽管这似乎并没有困扰他。四周一片漆黑，他试图旋转身体向下看。发现无法移动后，他继续向上看，那里看起来都一样。

'_This is where you truly belong.'_  
'这才是你真正的归属之地。'

Shinji started slightly, as he had forgotten entirely about the eerie voice.  
真嗣微微一惊，他完全忘记了那个诡异的声音。

'Who are you? What do you mean by this is were I belong? I hate this place.'  
'你是谁？你说的‘这是我该在的地方’是什么意思？我讨厌这个地方。'

'_Oh I think you'll grow to love it. Once you get used to the smell its quite pleasant to float there forever.'_  
'哦，我想你会逐渐爱上它的。一旦习惯了那股气味，永远漂浮在那里其实相当惬意。'

'I don't care, I have no reason to enjoy being here.'  
'我不在乎，我没有理由喜欢待在这里。'

'_So you don't care if something like this were to happen.'_  
'所以你不在乎这种事情是否会发生。'

The blackness became whiteness and then turned to crimson as the scene unfolded. It was similar to what Shinji had dreamt, except it was worse...far worse. Blood and gore was strung across Tokyo-3. There was so much blood and bodily fluids that the drainage systems were overflowing. It looked as though someone had spilled several thousand gallons of fruit punch and let it sit there. Except this fruit punch had pieces in it.  
黑暗转为光明，随后化作猩红，场景逐渐展开。这与真嗣梦中的情景相似，只是更加糟糕……糟糕得多。东京-3 四处血肉横飞。血液和体液如此之多，以至于排水系统都已溢出。看起来仿佛有人倾倒了数千加仑的果汁，任其流淌。只不过这果汁里混杂着碎片。

Shinji stared in horror as the scene unfolded and he was shown a rewound version of the events. The fifth angel appeared and Eva Unit-02 was deployed along with a blue and orange Eva that Shinji had not seen. Shinji watch, stunned, as the angel slashed through the earth with its energy whips, missing the two Eva's several times. Soon the Eva's lost their umbilical cord and were forced to fight on reserve power.  
真嗣惊恐地盯着眼前展开的场景，他被展示了一段倒放的事件版本。第五使徒出现，Eva 二号机与一架蓝橙相间的 Eva 被部署，这是真嗣未曾见过的。真嗣目瞪口呆地看着使徒用能量鞭划过大地，多次险些击中两架 Eva。不久，Eva 们失去了脐带电缆，被迫依靠备用电源战斗。

After that it was a battle of attrition. Soon Eva Unit-02 lost one of its arms and was sliced down the middle. Shinji had to turn away as he could almost hear Asuka's scream of pain and anger. The angel approached the Eva, to finish it off, when the blue and orange one came from the side and knocked the angel off balance. Pulling something that looked remarkably like a knife, it stabbed the angel in the chest. Repeating this several times, to no affect, the angel pushed the Eva off itself and proceeding to slashing it several more times.  
此后便是一场消耗战。很快，Eva 二号机失去了一只手臂，并被从中劈开。真嗣不得不转过头去，他几乎能听到明日香痛苦与愤怒的尖叫声。使徒逼近 Eva，准备给予致命一击，这时那架蓝橙相间的 Eva 从侧面冲来，将使徒撞得失去平衡。它抽出一把酷似刀的东西，猛刺使徒的胸膛。重复数次，却毫无效果，使徒将 Eva 推开，并继续对其进行多次劈砍。

Dodging was all the blue and orange Eva could do as its energy slowly drained. Charging forward in stabbed outwards only to have its hand sliced off and fall to the ground. Red blood flew from the angels hand as it dropped to one knee as its energy ran out. The angel observed it for a moment before looping off its head.  
蓝色与橙色的 Eva 只能不断躲避，随着能量逐渐耗尽。它冲向前试图攻击，却只换来一只手被切断，坠落地面。天使的手中喷涌出鲜血，它单膝跪地，能量耗尽。天使凝视片刻，随后斩下了它的头颅。

What followed next was random flashes of things that happened. Shinji watched as the angel sliced into a building, incinerating many humans but for the most part cutting of body parts and leaving them to bleed. Shinji watched as people from his class were killed or crushed. Toji and Kensuke where both crushed by falling rubble and Shinji had a strong urge to vomit after he heard their bones crunching. A particular painful moment happened as he watched Misato cradling a broken arm and crawling forward. A sharp piece of metal had sliced her leg off, just above the knee, preventing her from moving far.  
接下来是一连串混乱的闪回。真嗣目睹天使劈开一座建筑，大量人类被焚烧，但多数是被切断肢体，任其流血。他看到同班同学被杀或压碎。铃和健介都被落石压碎，真嗣听到他们骨头碎裂的声音，强烈地想要呕吐。尤其痛苦的一幕是，他看到美里抱着断臂，艰难爬行。一块尖锐的金属切断了她的腿，就在膝盖上方，使她无法远行。

Hardest of all was watching as Asuka slowly died. To the bitter end she tried to fight back, even though her Eva wasn't responding. When the angel had sliced her Eva in half it had only pierced part of the entry. Thanks to this Asuka didn't die immediately but it would have been kinder. She had been pierced in the stomach and now a mixture of blood and stomach acid was flowing from the open wound. Several times Shinji heard his own named mentioned in the mixture of swear words from the different languages she had learned.  
最难熬的是看着明日香慢慢死去。直到最后一刻，她仍在试图反抗，尽管她的 Eva 毫无反应。当使徒将她的 Eva 劈成两半时，只刺穿了部分插入栓。多亏了这一点，明日香没有立即死去，但那或许更为仁慈。她被刺穿了腹部，现在血液和胃酸正从开放的伤口中流出。几次听到自己的名字夹杂在她所学过的各种语言的咒骂中，真嗣感到一阵心痛。

Now Shinji hovered over the remains of what remained of the other Eva unit. Its entry plug had not been crushed surprisingly and Shinji found himself remembering more and more of his dream as events from it unfolded before his eyes. He saw the arm of the pilot sticking out, but now he saw something else...he was approaching it. His self from the vision was approaching the arm as it dangled lifelessly out of the Eva, and Shinji understood.  
现在，真嗣悬停在另一台 Eva 残骸的上方。令人惊讶的是，它的插入栓并未被压碎，随着梦境中的事件在眼前展开，真嗣发现自己越来越多地回忆起那个梦。他看到驾驶员的手臂伸出，但现在他看到了别的东西...他在接近它。梦境中的自己正接近那只从 Eva 中无力垂下的手臂，真嗣明白了。

Once again this was something that may or may not happen, and this time his decision controlled all of Tokyo-3.  
这又一次可能是也可能不会发生的事情，而这次他的决定将左右整个第三新东京市的命运。

"Figure it out yet?" "想明白了没？"

Shinji felt his body move on its own as he turned around and looked up at the Asuka from his dreams.  
真嗣感觉到自己的身体不由自主地动了起来，他转过身，抬头看向梦中出现的明日香。

"Nice little battle, to bad you weren't there, might have made a difference."  
"一场精彩的小战斗，可惜你不在，不然可能会改变些什么。"

"Are you here to give my advice or mock me?" Asked Shinji.  
"你是来给我建议的还是来嘲笑我的？" 真嗣问道。

"Oh, I'm done giving advice, I'm just here for the show.  
"哦，建议我已经给完了，现在我只是来看戏的。

"Thoughtful of you." "你真是体贴。"

Shinji's body turned then as if to show what happened one final time. 'I know what I've got to do, its just doing it is the problem.'  
真嗣的身体随后转了过来，仿佛要最后一次展示发生了什么。'我知道我必须做什么，只是做起来是个问题。'

"If your done feeling sorry for yourself I suggest you go back."  
“如果你已经自怜自艾够了，我建议你回去。”

"Why? I thought you weren't giving advice anymore."  
“为什么？我以为你不再提供建议了。”

"Don't think of it so much as advice. More of a friendly reminder."  
"别把它想成是建议，更像是友好的提醒。"

"Your my friend?" "你是我的朋友？"

Asuka scratched her chin thoughtfully, "Hmmm, I suppose, for now at least I am. Put it this way I don't want you to die."  
明日香若有所思地挠了挠下巴，“嗯，我想，至少目前我是。这么说吧，我不想你死。”

"Thanks...I think."  "谢谢...我想。"

---

Shinji felt his eyes open and if not for the fact that he heard the slamming of a door he would have thought thats what woke him up. Sitting up straighter he assumed that it wasn't Misato and could only guess that it had to be Asuka. Looking over, he noticed that it was a few minutes after noon. So she had left school early again.  
真嗣感到自己的眼睛睁开了，如果不是听到了门被猛力关上的声音，他可能会以为这就是唤醒他的原因。他坐得更直了些，猜测那不是美里，只能猜想那一定是明日香。他环顾四周，注意到已经是中午过后几分钟了。所以她又提前离开了学校。

Standing up, Shinji walked towards his bedroom door and slid it open slightly. Next second the door was slammed shut and Shinji was forced to take a step back.  
真嗣站起身，走向他的卧室门，轻轻地滑开了一点。下一秒，门被猛地关上，真嗣不得不后退了一步。

Slightly worried about her he took a hesitant step and said, "Err, Asuka...is everything okay?"  
他略感担忧，犹豫地迈出一步，问道：“呃，明日香……一切都还好吗？”

Without getting an answer he slid the door open again and this time without it getting shut in his face. Looking around quickly he didn't see her sitting at the kitchen table but heard talking coming from the living room.  
没有得到回答，他再次拉开门，这次没有被门甩在脸上。他迅速环顾四周，没看到她在厨房的桌子旁，却听到客厅传来说话声。

Walking into it, slightly nervous, he saw her laying on the couch, eating a bag of potato chips and flipping through the channels.  
他略带紧张地走进去，看到她正躺在沙发上，吃着一袋薯片，不停地换着电视频道。

Opening his mouth, Shinji was about to ask if anything had happened at school when he got rude answer.  
张开口，真嗣正要问学校是否发生了什么事，却得到了一个粗鲁的回答。

"Shut it Shinji, I don't want to talk you!"  
“闭嘴，真嗣，我不想跟你说话！”

Shinji raised an eyebrow at her. Did he do something that had made her angry? For the life of him he couldn't remember. Maybe it was what Misato had said about her staying home and looking after him. Shinji really couldn't care if she was there or not. It didn't make any difference to him whatsoever. Even so though he was annoyed that she was angry at him for something that he probably didn't even do.  
真嗣对她挑了挑眉。他做了什么让她生气的事吗？他怎么也想不起来。也许是因为美里提到她留在家里照顾他。真嗣真的不在乎她在不在。这对他没有任何影响。即便如此，他还是对她因为他可能根本没做过的事而生气感到不爽。

Smirking slightly he said, "What, did someone sneak a peak while you were at the drinking fountain again?"  
他微微冷笑道：“怎么，又有人在饮水机旁偷看你了？”

Asuka tore her eyes away from the T.V. briefly to give Shinji a heart piercing stare. Without replying to his comment she turned her gaze back towards the T.V.  
绫波零短暂地从电视上移开目光，向真嗣投去一个穿心的瞪视。她没有回应他的话，又将视线转回了电视。

'Guess she really doesn't want to talk, but I know one thing she will want to discuss.'  
“看来她真的不想说话，但我知道有一件事她肯定会想讨论。”

Walking out of the living room he walked into the kitchen and opened the fridge door. Yelling over he shoulder he said, "So what does your highness want for dinner tonight?"  
他走出客厅，步入厨房，打开了冰箱门。他扭头喊道：“那么，尊贵的大人今晚想吃什么呢？”

Shinji thought he heard something between a snarl and half a laugh.  
真嗣觉得他听到了介于咆哮和半声笑之间的声音。

Replying back she said, "Whatever the fuck you feel like. I don't give a shit right now."  
她回敬道：“随便你他妈想做什么。我现在不在乎。”

'Wow,' thought Shinji. 'If she didn't care about dinner than something pretty bad must have happened.  
'哇哦，' 真嗣心想。'如果她连晚饭都不在乎了，那一定是发生了相当糟糕的事情。

Ignoring dinner for now he walked back into the living room and stood directly in front of him.  
暂时不理会晚饭，他走回客厅，直接站在他面前。

"Move it ass-hole." “滚开，混蛋。”

"No. If you don't even care about dinner than something obviously happened."  
"不，如果你连晚饭都不在乎，那显然是发生了什么事。"

"It doesn't concern you!"  
"这不关你的事！"

"It might not but the Asuka I see in front of me is one that I certainly don't like living with."  
"可能不关我的事，但我眼前的这个明日香，绝对不是我想一起生活的样子。"

"As if you enjoy living with me anyway," she whispered.  
"好像你本来就很享受和我一起生活似的，" 她低声说道。

"On occasion I do, if you must know," mumbled Shinji.  
"偶尔是的，如果你非要知道的话，" 真嗣咕哝道。

Asuka seemed rather taken aback at this and her expression soften slightly. "Fine baka, if you must know I have to sit next to my least favorite person in the world at school now."  
明日香对此似乎颇为意外，她的表情稍稍缓和了一些。"好吧，笨蛋，如果你非要知道的话，我现在在学校不得不坐在世界上最讨厌的人旁边。"

Shinji almost laughed, "I thought I was your least favorite person in the world."  
真嗣差点笑出声来，“我以为我是你在这个世界上最不喜欢的人呢。”

"Its close, but your my second least favorite."  
“差不多吧，但你是我第二不喜欢的人。”

"Glad to hear it. So why the hell is this such a problem?"  
“很高兴听到这个。那这他妈的为什么是个问题？”

"Because I also have to-" Asuka paused, mentioning that Rei was the pilot of Eva Unit-00 wouldn't be smart. Shinji was supposed to know as little as possible if he wouldn't pilot Unit-01, at least thats what Misato said.  
"因为我也得——" 明日香停顿了一下，提到绫波是零号机的驾驶员并不明智。如果真嗣不驾驶初号机，他应该知道得越少越好，至少美里是这么说的。

"I just don't like people like her, she's stuck up, thinks she's so great."  
"我就是不喜欢她那种人，她自命不凡，觉得自己了不起。"

Shinji frowned, "You act as though you know her personally."  
真嗣皱眉道："你表现得好像很了解她似的。"

Thankfully Asuka was saved the need of replying when her phone vibrated briefly. Flipping it open she read a very short message from Misato. Flipping it closed she bit her lip slightly and stood up.  
幸好，当她的手机短暂震动时，明日香免去了回答的必要。她翻开手机，看到美里发来的一条简短信息。合上手机后，她微微咬了咬嘴唇，站起身来。

"Anything wrong, Asuka?" “有什么不对劲吗，明日香？”

"No, I just have to go to Nerv and do some tests, its standard."  
“没有，我只是得去 NERV 做一些测试，这是常规流程。”

Shinji nodded, "Then what do you want for dinner?"  
真嗣点点头，“那你想吃什么晚餐？”

This time Asuka gave him a long list of German foods and told him to just make one every night and to start at the top of the list. Shinji frowned down at it not liking some of the choices.  
这次明日香给了他一份长长的德国食物清单，并告诉他每晚做一种，从清单顶部开始。真嗣皱着眉头看着它，不喜欢其中的一些选择。

"I'll be back late, with Misato most likely."  
“我可能会晚点回来，和美里一起。”

"Okay..." Shinji felt like he had to say something but couldn't quite get his tongue wrapped around it.  
"好吧..." 真嗣觉得他得说点什么，但舌头就是绕不过来。

"Cya later then." "那回头见。"

"Yeah bye," Shinji mumbled.  
"嗯，再见，" 真嗣咕哝道。

When Asuka closed the door she flipped open her phone and called Misato as she started to run slightly. The first thing that she heard was a lot of rambling in the back round when Misato answered the phone.  
当明日香关上门时，她迅速打开手机，边跑边拨通了美里。她听到的第一件事是美里接电话时背景中的一大堆杂音。

"Asuka are you on your way."  
“明日香，你已经在路上了吗？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"Good, we don't have much time. It will hit land fall in thirty minutes. I'll brief you quickly and then we'll send you up." Here Misato paused and asked, "What did you tell Shinji?"  
“很好，我们时间不多了。它将在三十分钟后登陆。我会快速给你简报，然后我们就派你上去。”这时美里停顿了一下，问道，“你告诉真嗣什么了？”

"Tests," she said simply.  
"测试," 她简单地说道。

"Good, having two kids to worry about will just make me age faster."  
"好啊，有两个孩子要担心只会让我老得更快。"

Even though the joke had good intentions Asuka wasn't in the mood for joking around. The last thing she intended to do was tell Shinji what she really was doing, though she guessed he'd realize it in half an hour.  
尽管这个玩笑本意是好的，但明日香此刻并没有心情开玩笑。她最不想做的就是告诉真嗣她真正在做什么，尽管她猜他半小时后就会意识到。

---

Shinji had guessed that something was wrong, judging by the brief worried look that had passed over Asuka's face the moment she had gotten off the phone with Misato. Completely ignoring thoughts of dinner he sat down on the couch where Asuka had recently laid. The first thing that had come to his mind was an angel attack, though she had shot that idea down quickly with her mention of tests. But he didn't believe her, tests couldn't make a person go from calm to nervous in the span of seconds, and Asuka was not someone to get riled up easily.  
从明日香接完美里电话后那一闪而过的忧虑表情，真嗣猜测事情有些不对劲。他完全忽略了晚餐的想法，坐在了明日香刚刚躺过的沙发上。他首先想到的是使徒袭击，但她提到测试时迅速否定了这个想法。但他并不相信，测试不可能让人在几秒钟内从平静变得紧张，而明日香也不是那种轻易会被激怒的人。

Rolling off the couch he stood up and walked over to the nearest window and looked briefly.  
他从沙发上滚下来，站起身走到最近的窗户旁，短暂地向外望去。

'Well, if an angel was to show I'd feel it before I saw it,' he thought.  
“嗯，如果有使徒出现，我会在看到之前就感应到。”他心想。

Turning around he was about to walk to the kitchen to make a half hearted attempt on one of the many things that Asuka had give him to cook when he noticed the ceiling fan shake. Pausing for a moment he looked up at it again and it gave another small wobble, slightly larger than last time.  
他转过身，正打算走向厨房，勉强尝试做明日香给他的众多菜谱中的一项，这时他注意到天花板风扇在摇晃。他停顿了一下，再次抬头看去，风扇又轻轻晃动了一下，比上次幅度稍大。

Next, Shinji felt the ground beneath him shake violently and he had to brace himself so as not to fall on his face. When the tremors had settled he immediately bolted towards the door. Only then did he realize that an alarm had gone off and people were crowding around on the streets below, looking for a suitable shelter.  
紧接着，真嗣感觉到脚下的地面剧烈震动，他不得不稳住自己以免摔倒。当震动平息后，他立刻冲向门口。直到那时，他才意识到警报已经响起，人们正聚集在下面的街道上，寻找合适的避难所。

"Damn it, she didn't have to lie to me."  
“该死，她没必要对我撒谎。”

Taking off down the stairs he had to weave in and out of the sea of people that were trying to get to the shelter first. In the back round a cool female voice was telling everyone not to panic and to enter the shelters in an orderly fashion. Shinji had to smirk at the calmness in her voice. It was obviously a pre-recording and whoever had done it was miles away by now.  
他迅速冲下楼梯，不得不在试图抢先到达避难所的人群中穿梭。背景中，一个冷静的女声在告诉每个人不要惊慌，有序进入避难所。真嗣不得不对她的镇定语气暗自一笑。显然这是一段预先录制的音频，而录制者此刻早已远在千里之外。

Fighting his way out of the mass of people he managed to recognize two people from his class, Touji and Kensuke. Shinji was almost tempted to approach them but was deterred when he remembered what they had done to both him and Asuka. It seemed though that they had something they wanted to discuss as they both ran up to him.  
他奋力挤出人群，认出了班上的两个人，东治和健介。真嗣几乎想上前打招呼，但随即想起了他们对他和明日香所做的一切，便打消了念头。不过，他们似乎有话要说，两人都向他跑来。

"Hey fuck face!" “嘿，混蛋！”

Shinji had a sudden urge to rip Touji's skull out of his head but restrained himself. Asking in as calm a voice as he could muster he said, "What?"  
真嗣突然有种冲动，想把东治的头骨从他脑袋里扯出来，但还是忍住了。他尽可能平静地问道：“什么？”

"Where's Asuka, you live with her right, sleaze ball?"  
“惣流在哪里，你不是和她住一起吗，人渣？”

'Of course, they only wanted to know where she was.'  
“当然，他们只是想知道她在哪里。”

"No idea where she went, she took off immediately after she got home." Even though he wasn't a part of Nerv, telling other people what Asuka was involved with was not something that he considered telling.  
"不知道她去哪儿了，一回家就立刻离开了。" 尽管他不是 Nerv 的一员，但告诉别人关于明日香的事情，并不是他会考虑的事情。

"Tch, dick head you just want her all yo yourself."  
"切，你个混蛋就是想独占她。"

"Yeah, whatever," said Shinji not caring at all at this point.  
"是啊，随便吧，" 真嗣此时根本不在乎。

Turning around he started walking away when he felt a strong hand on his shoulder.  
他转过身，正要走开，却感到一只强有力的手搭在了他的肩膀上。

"Hey where you even listening to me!"  
“嘿，你到底有没有在听我说话！”

Shinji scowled back, "I tend to ignore people who bother the shit out of me."  
真嗣皱着眉头回道：“我通常会无视那些让我烦得要死的人。”

"Why you bastard!" “你这个混蛋！”

Touji brought his hand back to punch Shinji in the face again when he heard another voice over the loud speaker, this time slightly different.  
当听到另一个通过扩音器传来的声音，这次略有不同，真嗣准备再次挥拳打向真治的脸时，东治停了下来。

"Those that have not entered a shelter block please do so immediately, the city will descend in five minutes."  
“尚未进入避难区的市民请立即前往，城市将在五分钟后下沉。”

"Touji we should get to one," said a worried Kensuke.  
"图尔基，我们得去一个避难所。" 健介担忧地说道。

"Fine." "好吧。"

Touji backed away from Shinji and threw a scowl at him before turning towards the shelter blocks only to find that none now remained.  
图尔基从真嗣身边退开，向他投去一个怒视，然后转向避难所区块，却发现现在一个也不剩了。

"God damn it, look at what you made us do."  
"该死的，看看你让我们做了什么。"

"Its your one fault for harassing me, so if you die don't expect me to cry over your body"  
"这就是你骚扰我的代价，所以如果你死了，别指望我会为你流泪。"

"Thats it fuck face I'm beating the shit out of you."  
"就这样了，混蛋，我要把你打得屁滚尿流。"

Touji took several steps forward and probably would have knocked Shinji out again if Kensuke hadn't stepped in between them.  
冬二向前走了几步，要不是剑介及时插到他们中间，他可能又要给真嗣一拳。

"Guys this isn't the time to be fighting, we need to find another shelter before Tokyo-3 goes into lockdown."  
“伙计们，现在不是打架的时候，我们需要在东京-3 进入封锁前找到另一个避难所。”

As much as Shinji hated these two, Kensuke had a point. If Tokyo-3 sank into the Geofront then they'd fall several hundred feet to there death.  
尽管真嗣讨厌这两个人，但剑介说得有道理。如果东京-3 沉入地底，他们就会从几百英尺的高处坠落而死。

"Whatever, just stay out of my way," said Touji.  
“随便你，别挡我的路就行，”冬二说道。

'Likewise,' though Shinji.  
“彼此彼此，”真嗣心想。

Together the trio ran through the streets of Tokyo-3 quickly searching for a shelter, though without much luck.  
三人一起在第三新东京市的街道上奔跑，急切地寻找避难所，却运气不佳。

"Hey Shinji I'm rather surprised that your not with Asuka actually," said Kensuke.  
“嘿，真嗣，我挺惊讶你居然没和明日香在一起，”健介说道。

Shinji blinked back at him, rather surprised, "What makes you say that?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼看着他，同样感到惊讶，“你为什么这么说？”

Kensuke shrugged, "Well, you certainly know her better than anybody else at the school so it seems natural that you'd be with her more."  
健介耸了耸肩，“嗯，你在学校里肯定比任何人都更了解她，所以看起来你和她在一起更自然。”

"I...suppose," Shinji said slowly.  
"我...我想是的," 真嗣缓缓说道。

"But what are you doing out here. Where you looking for her?"  
"但你在这里做什么？是在找她吗？"

Shinji had to think about that for a second. What was he really doing out here? He already knew where and what Asuka was doing and he didn't have any inclination to go to where she was. Even so though, there was something akin to a driving force pushing him forward.  
真嗣不得不思考了一下。他到底在这里做什么？他已经知道明日香在哪里以及她在做什么，而且他也没有任何冲动想要去找她。即便如此，却有一种类似驱动力的东西在推动他前进。

Shaking his head he said, "Not sure, can't give you a correct answer."  
他摇摇头说：“不确定，没法给你一个正确的答案。”

"Hmm I see," nodded Kensuke thoughtfully.  
“嗯，我明白了，”健介若有所思地点点头。

Shinji was slightly annoyed at how Kensuke was acting around him right now. It was almost as if he was somebody that he had just met and everything that he had done to him was completely thrown out the window. If he thought they were friends he was sorely wrong.  
真嗣对健介此刻对待他的态度感到有些恼火。这简直就像是他刚刚认识的一个人，之前为他所做的一切都被抛诸脑后。如果他认为他们是朋友，那他可就大错特错了。

"Come on lets check over here."  
“快点，我们去那边看看。”

As soon as Shinji got the words out of his mouth the earth shook violently as the angel made landfall. Simultaneously Eva Unit-02 was brought up the elevator and broke the surface just to see the angel make landfall.  
真嗣话音刚落，大地便剧烈震动起来，天使登陆了。与此同时，EVA 二号机被升降机升起，破土而出，正好目睹天使登陆的瞬间。

Kensuke and Touji stood in a slight daze as they watched the Eva charge towards the oncoming angel.  
健介和薰站在原地，略显恍惚地看着 EVA 向迎面而来的天使冲去。

"Wha-what is that?" Stuttered the stupid jock.  
“那、那是什么？”那个笨蛋运动员结巴道。

Shinji didn't feel like explaining and just yelled over his shoulder, "Forget it we need to find a shelter."  
真嗣不想解释，只是回头喊道：“别管了，我们得找个避难所。”

As the two ran they could here the crumbling of buildings as the ones not brought into the Geofront crumble while the two fought.  
两人奔跑时，可以听到建筑倒塌的声音，那些未被带入地底都市的建筑在两人的战斗中崩塌。

Several seconds later the three of them found a shelter that still had some room left in it, however it could only hold two more people. The trio stood there briefly while the person holding the door open waited at the argument that was soon going to break out. Touji was prepared to fight for his if he had to when he heard someone laugh and say, "Get in you idiots, I never intended on entering a shelter anyway."  
几秒钟后，他们三人找到了一个还有些空间的避难所，不过只能再容纳两个人。三人短暂地站在那里，而那个扶着门的人则在等待即将爆发的争执。当听到有人笑道“进去吧，你们这些傻瓜，反正我也没打算进避难所。”时，东治已经准备好为他的位置而战了。

Spinning around, Touji and Kensuke saw Shinji smirking back at them.  
东治和真嗣转过身，看到真嗣正对他们得意地笑着。

"Get your asses in, this is what we've been walking around for haven't we."  
“快点进去，我们不就是为了这个才四处走的吗。”

Touji hoped directly in but Kensuke was a little hesitant. "Shinji you are going to look for another one, right?"  
真嗣直接走了进去，但剑介有些犹豫。“真嗣，你会去找另一个的，对吧？”

Shinji shrugged, "Maybe..." He already knew he wouldn't.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，“也许吧……”他其实已经知道他不会去。

Kensuke nodded and walked in behind Touji and the door was closed.  
剑介点点头，跟在真嗣后面走了进去，门随后被关上了。

Shinji had already turned around when Kensuke entered the shelter and was already walking in the opposite direction, to where the two demons were fighting, as he saw them.  
真嗣在健司进入避难所时已经转身，正朝着两个恶魔战斗的方向走去，他看到了他们。

'That Eva is definitely Asuka's, I just hope she can take that thing on.'  
'那台 EVA 肯定是明日香的，我只希望她能对付得了那东西。'

Turning around a corner he was hit in the face by a whirlwind of dust and small debris as a building had just collapsed that the angel had fallen in. Coughing slightly he looked up just to see the Eva flying through the air as the angel had counterattacked and wrapped several energy whips around the Eva's arm, and thrown it.  
转过一个拐角，他被一阵由建筑物倒塌引起的尘土和小碎片旋风击中了脸。轻轻咳嗽了一下，他抬头一看，只见 EVA 被天使反击，几条能量鞭缠绕在 EVA 的手臂上，将其抛向空中。

Quickly darting into an alley way Shinji just barely managed to dodge a car as it went soaring directly over where he had been standing moments before. Looking around the corner he saw the Eva get back up quickly and stare down its enemy. Grabbing something from a holster in its back it brought a small knife out which glowed white and charged at the angel.  
迅速闪入一条小巷，真嗣险些躲过一辆疾驰而过的汽车，那车几乎是擦着他刚才站立的地方飞驰而过。探头望向拐角，他看到初号机迅速起身，直面敌人。从背后的枪套中抽出某物，手中亮起一把白色光芒的小刀，向天使冲去。

Slicing across what would be considered its chest, the angel took several steps back to avoid it. Grabbing the arm that had the knife in it, it quickly twisted it and Shinji heard several pops as the arm joints disconnected.  
刀锋划过天使的胸前，它连退几步避开攻击。随即抓住持刀的手臂，迅速扭转，真嗣听到几声关节脱位的脆响。

Shinji was starting to become worried as the angel was repeatedly slashing at Unit-02. Next second though the ground shook again and several feet in front of him soared up the one that he had pilot Eva Unit-01.  
随着天使不断攻击二号机，真嗣开始感到担忧。然而下一秒，地面再次震动，在他前方几英尺处，他驾驶的初号机一飞冲天。

Shinji stared at it and could almost hear that voice in the back of his head. What he couldn't understand though was how someone else was able to pilot it. He had thought that anybody else that tried to pilot it would immediately die.  
真嗣盯着它，几乎能听到脑海深处的那个声音。但他无法理解的是，为什么其他人能够驾驶它。他曾以为任何试图驾驶它的人都会立即丧命。

Next second though, as the Eva tried to take several clumsy steps forward, it fell directly on its side and fell silent.  
然而下一秒，当 EVA 试图笨拙地向前迈出几步时，它直接侧身倒下，陷入了沉默。

Shinji was several hundred feet away from where the Eva fell and hesitated as he looked at its motionless body. He felt as though some unnatural force was pulling him towards the Eva. Inching closer he hesitated as he reached the entry plug and glanced around at anything that would open it.  
真嗣距离 EVA 倒下的地方有几百英尺远，他犹豫地看着它一动不动的身体。他感觉有一种超自然的力量在拉扯着他向 EVA 靠近。他慢慢接近，当到达插入栓时，他犹豫了一下，环顾四周寻找任何可以打开它的东西。

Reaching out for it a gust of wind threatened to knock him over as Unit 02 sent the angel backwards against a building collapsing it several blocks away from where Shinji stood. Looking behind himself hesitantly, he reached out for the handle for which he thought opened the entry plug. Though at the first touch of it he pulled back quickly as blisters erupted all over his skin. It was well over oven temperature.  
伸手去抓，一阵狂风差点将他吹倒，02 号机将使徒击退，使其撞上远处的一栋建筑，几条街区外，真嗣站立的地方轰然倒塌。他犹豫地回头望去，伸手去抓他认为能打开插入栓的把手。然而，刚一触碰，他便迅速缩回手，皮肤上瞬间冒出水泡。温度早已超过了烤箱的极限。

Grimacing at the pain now racking his right hand he took a deep breath, and for the life of him couldn't understand why he was doing it, and gripped both hands on the valve and twisted it.  
他因右手的剧痛而皱眉，深吸一口气，尽管自己也不明白为何要这么做，但还是用双手紧紧抓住阀门，用力旋转。

Ignoring the steadily increasing pain on his hands he turned the valve until it was all the way on the other side.  
他无视手上不断加剧的疼痛，转动阀门直到完全转到另一侧。

As the entry plug opened several gallons of LCL fluid leaked out, showering Shinji in it. Spitting a mouthful of the disgusting liquid he got his first look at the first child, Ayanami Rei.  
随着插入栓打开，几加仑的 LCL 液体泄漏出来，将真嗣淋了个透。他吐出一口这令人作呕的液体，第一次见到了第一适格者，绫波零。

Shinji didn't know what he had expected but not this. She was the person that he'd dreamt about. She had light blue hair and dark blue eyes, but the face...puzzled him. It seemed familiar somehow.  
真嗣不知道自己期待的是什么，但绝不是这样。她是他梦见过的人。她有着淡蓝色的头发和深蓝色的眼睛，但那张脸……让他感到困惑。不知为何，它似乎有些熟悉。

Hesitating slightly Shinji asked in a voice that sounded like it didn't want to be answered, "Hey, are you okay?"  
真嗣略显迟疑地问道，声音听起来似乎并不期待得到回答，“嘿，你还好吗？”

The girl shifted slightly at first and then slowly looked to where Shinji was looking in from the outside. Her expression was unreadable, neither happy nor angry that someone had asked her if she was all right.  
女孩起初微微动了动，随后缓缓转向真嗣从外面注视的方向。她的表情难以捉摸，既不高兴也不生气，有人问她是否还好。

Sitting slowly up in the plug Shinji then noticed that beads of sweat were on her eyes brows and she seemed to be clutching her side slightly.  
真嗣慢慢坐起身来，注意到她眼眉上挂着汗珠，似乎在轻轻按着侧腹。

Shinji bit his tongue. Here was this completely weird girl, who he had been dreaming about, and now he had just met her. What's more she seemed to be clutching her side as though she was injured.  
真嗣咬了咬舌头。这个完全古怪的女孩，他一直梦见的人，现在他刚刚遇见了她。更甚的是，她似乎在按着侧腹，好像受了伤。

Shinji was about to open his mouth though when the girl, surprisingly beat him to it.  
正当真嗣准备开口时，那女孩却出人意料地抢先了一步。

"Are you Ikari Shinji?" “你是碇真嗣吗？”

For some reason the mention of his last named seemed to anger him and a slight crease appeared on his forehead before he said, "Yeah I am."  
不知为何，提到他的姓氏似乎激怒了他，眉间微微皱起，随后他答道：“是的，我是。”

The girl nodded slightly and then got up shakily from the Eva Unit and hobbled slowly over to the opening in the plug.  
女孩微微点头，然后颤抖着从 Eva 机体中站起，一瘸一拐地慢慢走向插入栓的开口处。

"Hey what are you doing?" Asked Shinji as the girl got out.  
“嘿，你在干什么？”真嗣问道，看着女孩走出来。

Either she didn't here him or ignored his comment, either way she didn't answer.  
她要么是没听到他的话，要么是忽视了他的评论，总之她没有回答。

Shinji backed out of the way slightly as she took several steps forward and then seemed to loose her balance. Expecting something of this nature to happen, Shinji took several steps forward and caught her around the waist before she was able to hit the ground. It was then that Shinji realized that large amounts of blood were flowing from her side, which apparently had a large wound.  
真嗣微微退开，她向前走了几步，随后似乎失去了平衡。预料到这种情况，真嗣快步上前，在她摔倒之前搂住了她的腰。这时真嗣才发现，大量鲜血正从她的侧腹涌出，显然那里有一个大伤口。

Shinji had a strong urge then to yell at her, to ask why the hell she was piloting that thing in her condition. He never got the words out though as he assumed she wouldn't care.  
真嗣当时强烈地想要对她大喊，问她为什么在这种状态下还要驾驶那东西。但他没有说出口，因为他认为她不会在意。

"Come on, lets get out of here."  
“来吧，我们离开这里。”

"No."

Shinji had to do a double take as he saw her looking over at the Eva Unit.  
真嗣不得不再次确认，因为他看到她正朝 EVA 机体那边看去。

With a frown on his face Shinji said, "Come on, your hurt, I don't want to be here, and those things are capable of leveling a city."  
真嗣皱着眉头说：“拜托，你受伤了，我也不想待在这里，那些东西可是能夷平一座城市的。”

"No."

Shinji was starting to get annoyed and was about to retort angrily back at the girl when she said, "The Eva, it wants you to pilot it."  
真嗣开始感到恼火，正要生气地反驳那个女孩时，她却说：“EVA，它希望你来驾驶。”

Shinji blinked twice before he understood what she was talking about. Shaking his head he said, "No, I can't."  
真嗣眨了两次眼才明白她在说什么。他摇摇头说：“不，我不能。”

"And why is that?" “为什么呢？”

"Because I..." “因为我是……”

The girl looked blankly back at him as he turned his head the other way, biting down on his lip, unsure of what to say.  
女孩茫然地回望着他，而他则转向另一边，咬着嘴唇，不知该说什么。

"I don't like it," he finally whispered.  
"我不喜欢它，"他终于低声说道。

"Why don't you like it?"  
"你为什么不喜欢它？"

"I don't know damn it!"  
“我不知道，该死！”

His outburst didn't even seemed to faze her as she looked calmly back at him. Turning towards the Eva she said, "Only you can pilot that Eva, I tried and wasn't able to."  
他的爆发似乎并未影响到她，她平静地回望着他。转向 Eva，她说道：“只有你能驾驶那台 Eva，我试过了，但做不到。”

Shinji grumbled slightly at her words. He didn't want to, hell no, but the visions. He couldn't get the damn things out of his head.  
对于她的话，真嗣小声嘀咕了一下。他并不想，绝对不想，但那些幻象。他无法将那些该死的东西从脑海中赶走。

"It's asking you to go, why don't you?"  
"它让你去，你为什么不去呢？"

Shinji maybe thought it would be worth it just to get away from this girls questions.  
真嗣可能觉得，只要能逃离这些女孩的问题，就值得一试。

Looking over at the Eva briefly he could have sworn he felt a tug on his shirt as though it was pulling him towards itself.  
他短暂地瞥了一眼 Eva，几乎可以发誓感觉到自己的衬衫被拉了一下，仿佛是在把他拉向它。

Sighing in a dejected way he said, "Do I have a choice." It wasn't a question, it was acknowledgement.  
他沮丧地叹了口气，说道：“我有选择的余地吗？”这并非疑问，而是承认。

Letting go of the girl she watched him as he slowly walked over to the Eva took a few hesitating moments and climbed in. Almost at once the entry plug resealed itself as though it had found what it wanted.  
放开女孩后，她看着他慢慢走向 Eva，犹豫片刻后爬了进去。几乎就在他进入驾驶舱的瞬间，插入栓立刻重新封闭，仿佛找到了它所需要的东西。

Inside the entry plug Shinji immediately felt the voice talking to him again.  
在插入栓内，真嗣立刻再次感受到了那个声音在对他讲话。

"_Glad to see that your back."_  
"很高兴看到你回来了。"

"Don't expect me for long."  
"别指望我会待很久。"

"_You sure? I feel like I'm getting to know you better every time you climb in. Only I know what is deep in your heart."_  
"你确定吗？每次你爬进来，我都感觉越来越了解你。只有我知道你内心深处的秘密。"

"Thats great but how about we get moving."  
"那太好了，不过我们还是动身吧。"

"_Gonna save that red Eva."_  
"要去救那个红色 Eva。"

"Something like that," Shinji mumbled.  
"差不多吧，" 真嗣咕哝道。"

Trying to remember how he had done it before he put everyone ounce of his thought it making the Eva stand up. Slowly but surely it did.  
努力回忆着之前是如何做到的，他将每一分心思都投入到让 Eva 站起来的行动中。虽然缓慢，但确实做到了。

From the right Asuka saw this and smirked into the transceivers that were built into the entry plug. "Might as well stay down first child, I'm almost done."  
从右边，明日香通过内置在插入栓中的通讯器看到了这一幕，并得意地笑了。“最好还是先躺下吧，初号机，我差不多快完成了。”

"Err, hey...Asuka." “呃，嘿...明日香。”

Silence greeted Shinji's sudden intrusion at into battle. Asuka didn't reply, whether she was glad or angry Shinji didn't find out. However in the command center of Nerv Misato was beside herself with worry when she heard Shinji's voice over the intercom.  
沉默迎接了真嗣突如其来的参战。明日香没有回应，无论是高兴还是生气，真嗣都无从得知。然而在 NERV 的指挥中心，当听到真嗣通过通讯器传来的声音时，美里担心得几乎要崩溃了。

"Shinji what the hell do you think your doing," yelled Misato straight into the entry plug. Shinji felt like his ears were going to explode.  
“真嗣，你到底在想什么？”美里对着插入栓大喊。真嗣感觉自己的耳朵都要炸了。

"Helping, I think." “我想，是在帮忙。”

"You get out this instance."  
"你这次给我出去。"

"No. I'm in and staying, for now."  
"不，我现在要留下来，暂时。"

Suddenly a new voice came over the intercom and Shinji recognized it to be his father.  
突然，一个新的声音通过对讲机传来，真嗣立刻认出那是他父亲的声音。

"Am I to understand that you wont run away this time," he said in his usual drawl.  
"我是否可以理解为，这次你不会逃跑了，"他用一贯的拖腔说道。

"I'm here until I leave, and only I decide that."  
"我会留在这里，直到我自己决定离开。"

"Nerv does not employee selfish people."  
"NERV 不会雇佣自私的人。"

'Then why the hell are you here,' Shinji felt like saying.  
“那你他妈的为什么在这里，”真嗣感觉自己想说。

Ignoring his dad and everybody else at the command center he turned to see the angel flying through the air again as Asuka had just hit it with a metal light post.  
无视他的父亲和指挥中心里的其他人，他转身看到使徒再次飞过空中，因为明日香刚刚用一根金属灯柱击中了它。

"Heh, try getting up after that you bastard."  
“哼，挨了这下看你还怎么爬起来，混蛋。”

"Asuka, I don't think thats enough to-"  
"明日香，我觉得这还不够——"

Once again she completely ignored him.  
她又一次完全无视了他。

Sighing to himself he thought he should have suspected this attitude. Likely she wanted all the glory and didn't care what his thoughts were on the matter, typical.  
他暗自叹息，心想自己早该料到这种态度。她大概只想独揽荣耀，根本不在乎他对这件事的看法，真是典型的。

"_Aren't you going to do anything?"_  
"你难道不打算做点什么吗？"

"I didn't do anything last time, you took over."  
"上次我什么都没做，是你接手的。"

"_Thats right, I had fun. All right since I had my fun I'll help you this time."_  
"没错，我玩得很开心。好吧，既然我玩够了，这次就帮你一把。"

The Eva's nerves suddenly bore into the metal of the entry plug and burst through into sea of LCL fluid were they started floating. Shinji eyed them worriedly and said, "Why are you using those things again?"  
EVA 的神经突然穿透插入栓的金属，冲入 LCL 溶液中开始漂浮。真嗣担忧地看着它们，问道：“为什么又用这些东西？”

"_I've told you its easier to sync with you, because it is particularly you."_  
“我告诉过你，与你同步更容易，正是因为你。”

"What is that supposed to mean?"  
“那是什么意思？”

"_Something that doesn't concern you."_  
"与你无关的事。"

Without warning the nerves pierced Shinji's skin and dug into his body where they wrapped around his own nerves. Slowly blood started to leak from the wounds.  
毫无预警地，神经刺穿了真嗣的皮肤，深入他的身体，缠绕在他的神经上。慢慢地，血液开始从伤口中渗出。

"_Hmm, the mixing of the blood and LCL fluid isn't going as well as I'd hoped. Their is a shortage of the LCL fluid since you opened it earlier. Guess it can't be helped will have to rely on your blood."_  
"嗯，血液与 LCL 液体的混合并不如预期顺利。由于你之前打开过，LCL 液体不足。看来只能依靠你的血液了，没办法。"

"And what does my blood have to do with anything."  
"我的血与这一切有何关系。"

"_You ask to many questions, just sit there and watch."_  
"你问得太多了，就坐在那儿看着吧。"

Eva Unit 01 then let out a roar that shattered the windows of the buildings around it. Crouching down on all fours it dashed quickly off against the ground and hurled itself at the angel. The angel, completely focused on Unit 02 was caught of guard and sent hurling into the nearest building. Jumping up and down, Eva Unit 01 let out another loud roar as it charged at the angel again.  
随后，Eva 初号机发出一声咆哮，震碎了周围建筑的窗户。它四肢着地，迅速冲向地面，猛地扑向使徒。使徒全神贯注于二号机，猝不及防被撞进了最近的建筑。初号机跳跃着，再次发出震耳欲聋的咆哮，又一次向使徒发起冲锋。

Grabbing one of the energy whips it squeezed it quickly and broke it in a shower of blood and gore. Letting out a wounded howl the angel took several clumsy steps back only to be greet by a savage punch from Eva Unit 02.  
抓住其中一条能量鞭，它迅速挤压并将其在一阵血肉横飞中折断。天使发出受伤的嚎叫，踉跄后退几步，却迎面挨了 Eva 初号机 02 的一记猛拳。

"Take that Bastard." “接招吧，混蛋。”

Shinji was almost felt like he was in a drunken rage as he watched things unfold from inside the entry plug. He hated not knowing what to do and being at the mercy of the voice in the Eva, or what he wast starting to call the Devil.  
真嗣在插入栓内几乎感觉自己像是在醉酒般的狂怒中目睹这一切。他痛恨不知所措，任由 Eva 中的声音摆布，或者他开始称之为恶魔的存在。

As the angel backed slowly away from Tokyo-3, planning to retreat, Unit 01 quickly pounced on it and grabbed it by the neck and twisted it savagely until it broke with the sound of a battleship bombardment.  
天使缓缓后退，打算撤离东京-3，但初号机迅速扑上前去，一把抓住其颈部，猛力扭转，直至断裂声如战舰炮击般响起。

"_That was dull, I didn't even have to use berserk mode."_  
“真无聊，我连暴走模式都没用上。”

Shinji felt himself slowly blacking out as he had lost to much blood. "At least its over."  
真嗣感到自己逐渐失去意识，失血过多。“至少，一切都结束了。”

"_For now at least."_  "至少目前如此。"

---

"This constant cycle of bleeding and healing is going to affect him."  
"这种持续的流血与愈合循环会对他产生影响。"

"How bad?" "有多严重？"

"I can't say for sure but he seems to heal surprisingly quickly, which worries me since it could be a side effect of being in that Eva."  
"我不敢肯定，但他似乎恢复得异常快，这让我担心，因为这可能是驾驶那台 Eva 的副作用。"

"Do you really think its that bad."  
"你真的认为有那么糟糕吗？"

"Judging by the fact that Rei couldn't pilot it I can assure you that it's very different."  
"鉴于丽无法驾驶它这一事实，我可以向你保证，它非常不同。"

"I suppose...at least it didn't go berserk."  
"我想...至少它没有发狂。"

"No, Shinji seemed to be more in control that last time, but still far from a decent sync. At times he far out passes Asuka's records and at times he barely meets the minimum sync levels."  
"不，真嗣这次似乎更能控制自己了，但离良好的同步率还差得远。有时候他远远超过明日香的记录，有时候却勉强达到最低同步率。"

"Any ideas?" "有什么想法吗？"

"None." "没有。"

Misato sighed, "Thanks Ritsuko for all the help."  
美里叹了口气，"谢谢你，律子，帮了这么多忙。"

"No problem, he shouldn't be in any immediate danger though so when he gets up you should be able to go home."  
"没事，他应该没有立即的危险，等他醒来后你们就可以回家了。"

"Thanks again." “再次感谢。”

Ritsuko simply waived a hand as she walked out of the hospital room.  
律子只是挥了挥手，便走出了病房。

Several minutes later Shinji felt his eyes open slowly. It felt like they had been crusted shut.  
几分钟后，真嗣感到自己的眼睛缓缓睁开，感觉像是被粘住了一样。

"Shinji you're awake!" "真嗣，你醒了！"

It took Shinji several minutes to figure out who was talking then...  
真嗣花了好几分钟才弄清楚是谁在说话……

"Misato?" "美里？"

"Yeah how do you feel."  
"嗯，你感觉怎么样。"

"Sore, like I had needles drilled into me."  
"疼得像被针钻进去一样。"

"Well, you did have the Eva's nerves connected with yours."  
"嗯，你的神经确实和 Eva 的连接在一起了。"

"Yeah..." "是啊..."

"So ready to go home."  
"终于可以回家了。"

Shinji looked up hopefully, "I can leave."  
真嗣满怀希望地抬头，"我可以走了。"

"Yeah, nothing's wrong with you so we can leave whenever."  
"是啊，你没事了，我们随时都可以离开。"

"Okay, yeah I'm ready." "好的，是的，我准备好了。"

Shinji got out of bed and changed quickly while Misato waited by the door.  
真嗣迅速起床更衣，美里则在门口等候。

"All ready then?" "那么，都准备好了吗？"

Shinji nodded. 真嗣点了点头。

"Good, I'm sure Asuka is wanting food right about now."  
"好，我相信明日香现在一定饿了。"

Shinji felt a little sweat dripped from his chin then. He had forgotten about Asuka.  
真嗣感到一滴汗珠从下巴滴落。他忘了明日香。

---

Shinji had thought that he had finally gotten used to Misato's driving but he had to look back at the drive home as he walked into the apartment clutching his stomach.  
真嗣本以为自己终于习惯了美里开车的方式，但当他走进公寓，手捂着肚子时，不得不回想回家的那段车程。

"About time," said an angry voice.  
“终于回来了，”一个愤怒的声音说道。

Shinji looked up to see Asuka in short blue shorts and a pink tank-top standing in front of the door with her foot tapping impatiently.  
真嗣抬头一看，只见明日香穿着蓝色短裤和粉色背心，站在门前，不耐烦地用脚敲打着地面。

"Do you have any idea how hungry I've gotten waiting for you."  
"你知道我等你等得有多饿吗？"

"Gomen Asuka, I didn't want to wake Shinji up."  
"对不起，明日香，我不想吵醒真嗣。"

"Whatever I want something for dinner, now."  
"无所谓，我现在想吃晚饭了。"

Even though she still hadn't said anything to him since she left earlier or looked at him for that matter, he took this as an indirect way of asking him to make dinner.  
尽管她自从早些时候离开后还没对他说过任何话，甚至也没看他一眼，但他把这当作是间接让他准备晚餐的请求。

"Yeah, I'll get right on it."  
“好的，我马上就去弄。”

"But Shinji you just got out of the hospital, surely-"  
“但是真嗣，你刚出院，肯定——”

"Its fine Misato." “没事的，美里。”

Asuka meanwhile had retreated to the couch and turned on the T.V. and turned the volume up so she couldn't here Shinji whistling in the kitchen.  
与此同时，明日香已经退到沙发上，打开了电视，并把音量调高，这样她就听不到真嗣在厨房里吹口哨的声音了。

It was probably the first time since they all three started to live together that not a word was spoken at the dinner table. Shinji for the most part kept to himself and only talked when addressed, but Asuka and Misato talked a lot. Not today.  
自从他们三人开始同居以来，这可能是第一次晚餐桌上没有一个人说话。真嗣大部分时间都保持沉默，只在被问到时才开口，但明日香和美里通常话很多。今天却不同。

The air itself seemed to be unsocial and half way through dinner Asuka couldn't take any more of it and stood up, planting both palms on the table, and walked over to the living room with her half eaten plate.  
空气中似乎弥漫着不和谐的气息，晚餐进行到一半时，明日香再也忍受不了，猛地站起身来，双手撑在桌上，端着只吃了一半的盘子走向客厅。

When Asuka finally left Shinji stopped playing with his food and asked Misato. "Err, is she angry that I killed he angel and not her?"  
当明日香终于离开后，真嗣停止了玩弄食物，向美里问道：“呃，她是不是因为我杀了使徒而不是她而生气？”

Misato shrugged, "No idea."  
美里耸了耸肩，“不知道。”

Sighing Shinji pushed his half eaten plate of food away from himself and walked into the living room.  
叹了口气，真嗣将只吃了一半的盘子推开，走进了客厅。

Predictably Asuka was watching something in German and taking up the whole couch. Shinji stood there for several seconds, listening to whatever she was watching and was about to turn around when a harsh voice said, "What do you want?"  
不出所料，明日香正在看德语节目，占据了整个沙发。真嗣站在那里几秒钟，听着她正在看的内容，正要转身离开时，一个严厉的声音问道：“你想要什么？”

Shinji looked over his shoulder to see Asuka still looking at the T.V. even though she had just asked him a question.  
真嗣回头一看，只见明日香仍然盯着电视，尽管她刚刚问了他一个问题。

Shaking his head he said, "Why are you mad at me."  
他摇摇头说：“你为什么生我的气？”

"Because you're a baka, plain and simple."  
“因为你就是个笨蛋，简单明了。”

"You tell me I'm an idiot at least twice a day, if not more, its something more important than that."  
“你每天至少两次说我是个白痴，如果不是更多的话，这次是比这更严重的事。”

"Fine then, I'm angry that you left the house and then started fighting the angel without giving a thought about it."  
"好吧，我生气了，你离开家后就开始和天使战斗，根本没考虑过后果。"

"Asuka I didn't have a choice, it just happened in front of me. It's not like I wanted that to happen."  
"明日香，我别无选择，它就发生在我面前。又不是我想要这样的。"

"Baka!" "笨蛋！"

"Whatever, be that way. You're too stubborn as it is."  
“随你怎么说，你本来就固执得要命。”

As Shinji turned away he heard the shifting of something and next second heard a crash as something exploded over his head.  
当真嗣转身离开时，他听到了什么东西移动的声音，下一秒就听到头顶上传来爆炸声。

Being careful not to step on the broken plate he turned around to see a red faced, angry Asuka glaring poisonously back at him.  
他小心翼翼地避开破碎的盘子，转过身来，看到满脸通红、怒气冲冲的明日香正恶狠狠地瞪着他。

"DON'T YOU DARE ACT LIKE YOUR THE ONLY ONE THAT DOESN-" Asuka got a hold of her feeling then as she realized that she'd be making herself vulnerable.  
"你敢装作只有你一个人在受苦——" 明日香控制住了自己的情绪，随即意识到自己正变得脆弱。

Shinji meanwhile was looking curiously back at her, unsure what to make of this sudden outburst and subsequent retreat.  
与此同时，真嗣好奇地回头看着她，不明白这突如其来的爆发和随后的退缩意味着什么。

"If it makes you feel any better I'm sorry, for whatever I did. Now I'm going to bed, night."  
"如果这能让你感觉好些，我道歉，无论我做了什么。现在我要去睡觉了，晚安。"

Shinji then turned and walked down the hall leaving Asuka alone in the living room. Biting her lip slightly she slumped back down into the couch cushions and thought, 'Sorry, you could have died. Baka!'  
真嗣随后转身沿着走廊走去，留下明日香一人在客厅。她轻轻咬着嘴唇，又瘫坐在沙发垫上，心想：‘对不起，你本可能死掉的。笨蛋！’

### Chapter 5: Understanding  
第五章：理解  

**Well as I said I'd get this done a lot earlier then the last four month wait time...and here it is. I think this is the shortest chapter I've done so far for Spawn of Adam, though they wont get shorter than this. Anyway I'm going to yellowstone for ten days and they've got internet there. So hopefully I'll get some typing done while there. Also something I forgot to mention in the last chapter, I made a ShinjiXAsuka amv and put it on youtube. I originally made it back in January but only got around to posting it last month. So if you like Breaking Benjamin (song is Diary of Jane) then you'll probably like this. Ja Ne  
正如我所说，我会比上次四个月的等待时间提前完成这个章节……现在它来了。我认为这是迄今为止《亚当之子》中最短的一章，尽管不会再比这更短了。无论如何，我将去黄石公园十天，那里有互联网。所以希望在那里我能完成一些打字工作。另外，我在上一章忘记提到，我制作了一个真嗣 X 明日香的视频并上传到了 YouTube。我原本在一月份就制作好了，但直到上个月才发布。所以如果你喜欢 Breaking Benjamin（歌曲是《简的日记》），那么你可能会喜欢这个。再见**

---

"Get up, and make our lunches," said an angry voice from his door.  
“起床，给我们准备午餐，”一个愤怒的声音从他的门口传来。

Shinji rolled over and grumbled about it being to early before Asuka planted her bare foot directly on his face.  
真嗣翻了个身，咕哝着说时间还太早，结果明日香直接把她的赤脚踩在了他的脸上。

"Move it! You better not expect me to eat that shit they call food at school."  
快点！你最好别指望我吃学校里那些他们称之为食物的垃圾。

Pushing Asuka's foot off his face he glared at her briefly before resigning to her demands. Looked like she was still angry.  
他推开明日香的脚，短暂地瞪了她一眼，然后无奈地接受了她的要求。看来她还在生气。

Standing up quickly he pushed passed her and walked into the kitchen to start making their bento's. Shinji was somewhat surprised though that she didn't wake him up earlier to make breakfast. Though judging from the bowl of half eaten cereal on the kitchen table she wasn't particularly hungry.  
他迅速站起身，推开她走进厨房开始准备便当。这让真嗣有些惊讶，她竟然没有早点叫醒他做早餐。不过从厨房桌上那碗只吃了一半的麦片来看，她似乎并不怎么饿。

Sighing slightly, he turned towards the fridge and started assembling all the ingredients for the bento's.  
他轻轻叹了口气，转向冰箱，开始组装便当所需的所有食材。

Half an hour later, the two of them walked out the door with Asuka maintaing several yards in front Shinji. He didn't seem to mind it really though, if anything he was avoiding her as much as possible.  
半小时后，两人一前一后走出门，明日香保持着几码的距离走在真嗣前面。他似乎并不介意，甚至可以说，他尽可能地避免与她接触。

The day before, when Misato returned from Nerv, Shinji was told that if he continued to fight the angels then he would have to run tests while in the Eva. He wasn't thrilled by this but expected it nonetheless. Asuka seemed furious though and this seemed to just build on top of her new hate for Shinji. So after a hectic yelling match between the two she had hit him...hard, and stormed back to her room. So Shinji would only be more than happy to be able to ignore her for the rest of the day. Though that didn't seem to be the case as a sudden bout of nausea hit him and he felt his vision grow blurry until he passed out.  
前一天，当美里从 NERV 回来时，真嗣被告知如果他继续与使徒战斗，那么他必须在 EVA 中进行测试。他对此并不兴奋，但仍然有所预料。然而，明日香似乎非常愤怒，这似乎加剧了她对真嗣的新恨意。于是在两人之间爆发了一场激烈的争吵后，她狠狠地打了真嗣一拳，然后怒气冲冲地回到自己的房间。因此，真嗣非常乐意能在当天剩下的时间里无视她。然而，这似乎并不可能，因为他突然感到一阵恶心，视线变得模糊，直到他昏倒。

---

'Really this is starting to get annoying,' he thought to himself as he watched himself walking out the door of Misato's apartment with Asuka slightly in the lead. It was a replay of what had just happened to him. He watch from above as two of them walked, with her always slightly in the lead.  
“真的，这开始变得烦人了，”他一边看着自己走出美里公寓的门，明日香稍稍领先，一边心想。这是刚刚发生在他身上的事情的重演。他从上方看着两人行走，她总是稍稍领先。

After several minutes of this he was starting to get bored when everything changed. It looked like he was watching an extremely sped up tape on a VCR. He watched as he entered school and spent most of the time slouching in his chair with his eyes half open, glancing out the window occasionally.  
经过几分钟这样的情景，他开始感到无聊，直到一切都发生了变化。仿佛在观看一台 VCR 上极度加速的录像带。他看到自己走进学校，大部分时间都懒散地坐在椅子上，眼睛半睁，偶尔瞥向窗外。

Next they were walking out of the doors to school and seemed to be on their way to the Nerv testing facilities. Except that somebody else was with them. Shinji couldn't tell who it was though and this puzzled him. It was like a gray human like shape was walking in between him and Asuka. Why bother showing the gray shape if he couldn't even see the person. At least he thought it was a person.  
接着，他们走出学校大门，似乎正前往 NERV 的测试设施。只是，有另一个人和他们在一起。真嗣看不清是谁，这让他感到困惑。一个灰色的类人形身影走在他和明日香之间。既然他连那个人都看不清，为什么还要展示这个灰色身影呢？至少他认为那是个人的形状。

When they arrived at Nerv a security personal paused from a moment to check their idea and then let them through. After that Shinji got brief flashes of things that happened in the facilities. He saw as he changed in what Misato had called a plug suit. It seemed to be black, blue and white. He saw himself taking a deep breath before walking into the entry plug of Eva Unit 01. He saw all three of the Evas lined up, including the blue and orange one.  
到达 NERV 时，一名安保人员停顿片刻检查他们的身份，然后放行。之后，真嗣短暂地看到了设施内发生的一些事情。他看到自己换上了美里所说的插入栓服，似乎是黑、蓝、白三色。他看到自己深吸一口气，走进了 EVA 初号机的插入栓。他看到三台 EVA 并排站立，包括那台蓝橙相间的机体。

After that almost nothing. He saw a few brief flashes of things that happened afterwards. It looked like him and Asuka had another fight and he was left standing in the road with a red mark on his cheek. After this everything went blurry and he suddenly felt himself falling, and falling into nothingness.  
自那之后，几乎一片空白。他瞥见了几幕后续的片段。似乎是他和明日香又吵了一架，他独自站在路上，脸颊上留着一道红印。此后一切变得模糊，他突然感到自己在坠落，坠入无尽的虚空。

---

"Wake up, damn it!" “快醒醒，该死的！”

Shinji felt somebody hitting him hard at the side of his head and opened his eyes slowly, just as Asuka was about the backhand him again.  
真嗣感到有人重重地击打他的头部一侧，他缓缓睁开眼睛，正好看到明日香准备再次反手打他。

It was curious how he reacted. Before her hand was about to strike him he caught it with surprising speed that he didn't even know he possessed. With a glazed look over his eyes as though he was stilling falling through the blackness he looked up at Asuka. It was hard to tell what her expression was, most of it seemed to be angry but Shinji thought he sensed a tiny bit of worry, though he didn't expect her to say it in words.  
他的反应颇为耐人寻味。在她即将打中他之前，他以惊人的速度抓住了她的手，连他自己都没想到能有这样的反应。他的眼神迷离，仿佛仍在那片黑暗中坠落，他抬头看向明日香。很难判断她的表情，大部分似乎是愤怒，但真嗣觉得他察觉到了一丝担忧，尽管他不指望她会用言语表达出来。

"Let go of me ass-hole."  
“放开我，混蛋。”

Wrenching her hand out of his grip she glared at him slightly before snarling. "What the fuck was that about?"  
她用力挣脱他的手，稍稍瞪了他一眼，随即咆哮道：“你他妈刚才那是什么意思？”

Shinji would have dearly liked to retort back something similar but kept his cool and said. "Nothing, just anticipation for today's tests."  
真嗣本想狠狠回敬一句，但还是保持了冷静，说道：“没什么，只是对今天的测试有些期待。”

"No amount of tests will improve you, baka."  
“再多的测试也改变不了你，笨蛋。”

Shinji ignored her comment, stood up calmly, and grabbed his bag which lay discarded on the sidewalk. Turning around briefly he glanced at Asuka briefly who seemed somewhere torn between loathing and spite, which didn't make a difference in Shinji's opinion.  
真嗣无视了她的评论，平静地站起身，拿起被丢在人行道上的书包。他转头短暂地瞥了一眼明日香，她似乎在厌恶和怨恨之间挣扎，但在真嗣看来，这并没有什么区别。

Turning back around he started walking forward at a slow pace when he felt something hard hit his shoulder and a flash of red moved past him. Rubbing his shoulder where she had punched him he looked ahead and was unsurprised that she had widened the distance between them.  
他转过身，开始以缓慢的步伐前行，忽然感到有什么硬物击中了他的肩膀，一道红影从他身边掠过。他揉着被她打中的肩膀，抬头望向前方，对于她拉大了彼此间的距离并不感到意外。

"Does she always have to act so superior to everyone?" He mumbled before walking at the same pace that he had been moving at moments before.  
“她总是要表现得比所有人都高人一等吗？”他低声嘀咕着，继续保持着之前那段时间的步伐。

---

School was still a nightmare but one thing seemed to have changed. Kensuke seemed to respect Shinji a little because of what he said at the shelters. Even Touji didn't seem like a jerk as much, but he kept up with it mainly because everyone else did.  
学校依旧如噩梦般，但似乎有一件事发生了变化。因为他在避难所说的话，健介似乎对真嗣多了几分尊重。就连东治也不再那么像个混蛋了，不过他主要还是因为大家都这么做而继续保持。

When Shinji walked into class that day he was unsurprised to see Asuka already sitting in front of his desk looking determinedly out the window. Ignoring this he walked over to his desk and was about to sit down when he stopped in the middle of sitting. Next to Asuka was a girl with blue hair, the same from the day before.  
那天，当真嗣走进教室时，看到明日香已经坐在他的桌前，坚定地望着窗外，他并不感到意外。他无视这一点，走到自己的桌前，正要坐下时，却在半空中停住了。在明日香旁边，有一个蓝头发的女孩，正是前一天见过的那位。

She gave no inclination that she recognized Shinji, in fact, from his view, she seemed to not even know where she was. A vague, blank expression was on her face as she continued staring at the chalk bored. Shinji noticed, without perverted intentions, that she seemed to be holding herself different, as though she was in discomfort. Then he remembered the large wound that she had suffered and was about to open his mouth when a slight snarl came from across the room.  
她没有表现出任何认出真嗣的迹象，实际上，从他的角度看，她似乎连自己在哪里都不知道。她的脸上带着一种模糊而空洞的表情，继续盯着黑板。真嗣注意到，没有不正当的意图，她似乎在以不同的方式支撑着自己，仿佛感到不适。然后他想起了她所受的重伤，正要开口时，教室另一边传来了一声轻微的咆哮。

"Shinji, are you going to stand there forever or can you sit so I can get on with teaching."  
“真嗣，你是打算一直站在那里，还是能坐下来让我继续上课？”

Several of the kids snickered as Shinji threw his teacher a scowl and sat behind Asuka who at that moment didn't know who she hated more: Shinji or the First Child.  
有几个孩子窃笑起来，真嗣瞪了老师一眼，坐在了明日香后面，那一刻她不知道自己更恨谁：真嗣还是第一适任者。

While school was still something he loathed he found it easier to get through the day. He even started to attracted less unpleasant remarks from the other students, which he thought might have a lot to do with living with Asuka. Seemed many of the boys had finally found out what she was really like and lost interest in her, which seemed to annoy her. After all her complaining about every guy wanting to get in bed with her she was getting annoyed by the lack of attention. Shinji then snorted at the thought of this as he sat down up on the school roof. Classes had just been dismissed for lunch and Shinji didn't have an appetite right now. Last thing he needed was to hurl during his first test.  
尽管学校依然是他所厌恶的地方，但他发现日子变得容易熬过去了。他甚至开始少受其他学生的恶言恶语，他认为这可能与和明日香同住有很大关系。似乎许多男生终于发现了她的真面目，对她失去了兴趣，这似乎让她很恼火。毕竟，她一直在抱怨每个男人都想和她上床，而现在她却因为缺乏关注而感到恼火。真嗣想到这里，嗤之以鼻，他坐在学校屋顶上。刚放学去吃午饭，真嗣现在没有胃口。他最不需要的就是在第一次考试中呕吐。

After several minutes of laying there Shinji thought that he could hear two distinct voices coming up the stairwell. Sitting up just in time he saw the door flung open and bounce off against the wall only to be kicked again. Touji walked disgruntled out into the open with a slight tense Kensuke behind him.  
躺了几分钟后，真嗣觉得他能听到楼梯间传来两个不同的声音。他及时坐起来，看到门被猛地推开，撞到墙上又被踢了一脚。东治一脸不悦地走了出来，紧随其后的是略显紧张的健介。

'So much for peace and quiet,' thought Shinji.  
“看来平静的日子是没戏了，”真嗣心想。

Surprisingly though they didn't seem to want to pick on him as Kensuke walked up to Shinji and said rather hurriedly.  
然而出乎意料的是，他们似乎并不想找他麻烦，健介快步走向真嗣，急匆匆地说道。

"Hey...umm, I'm sorry for everything that I...we've ever done to you." Touji acted as though he wasn't listening. Kensuke continued.  
“嘿...呃，对于我们对你做过的所有事情，我...我们感到很抱歉。” 透治表现得好像没在听一样。健介继续说道。

"And I was just hoping that we could put our past differences aside and well..." Kensuke then put out his hand in front of Shinji and gave something close to a bow.  
"我刚才只是希望我们能放下过去的分歧，嗯……" 随后， Kensuke 伸出手，向真嗣微微鞠了一躬。

Shinji wasn't sure whether to laugh, rebuke him, or shake his hand. Never being good any stuff like this he scratched the back of his head and said, "Oh...yeah." Grabbing his hand rather uncertain of himself he shook Kensuke's hand who responded by sitting down next to Shinji and opening his lunch box.  
真嗣不确定是该笑，还是该责备他，或是握手。对于这种事情他一向不擅长，于是挠了挠后脑勺，说："哦……嗯。" 他有些犹豫地握住了 Kensuke 的手，而 Kensuke 则顺势坐在真嗣旁边，打开了便当盒。

"Want some?" "要来点吗？"

Shinji shook his head, "Best not to."  
真嗣摇了摇头，"最好别这样。"

Kensuke shrugged and went back to eating. It appeared that even Touji's still apparent annoyance of Shinji could not even deter him from eating as he sat down next to Kensuke and plowed into his own lunch. Even though Shinji didn't want to admit it he was glad that he had finally made a friend, well there was Asuka, but that varied.  
健介耸了耸肩，继续吃他的饭。看来，即使是对真嗣依然明显的恼怒，也无法阻止他吃饭。他坐在健介旁边，大口吃着自己的午餐。虽然真嗣不想承认，但他很高兴自己终于交到了一个朋友，嗯，还有明日香，但那关系时好时坏。

"Hey Shinji I was wondering," said Kensuke between bites.  
"嘿，真嗣，我在想，"健介边吃边说。

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

"What happened to you after we left you at that shelter."  
"我们把你留在那个收容所后，你发生了什么事？"

Its a good thing that Shinji wasn't eating anything or he would have just gone into a choking fit. This was the least thing that he expected Kensuke to ask. Stuttering slightly he said, "Oh I wandered around before I found a shelter."  
幸好真嗣没在吃东西，否则他可能会呛到。这是他最没想到健介会问的问题。他稍微结巴了一下，说道：“哦，我四处流浪了一阵子，然后找到了一个避难所。”

"Did you here about the rumor that have been going around town lately?"  
"你听说了最近城里流传的那些谣言吗？"

"Err what rumors?" Shinji had an idea but wasn't about to say it.  
"什么谣言？" 真嗣心里有数，但并不打算说出来。

"That underneath Tokyo-3 is a secret military organization and that it conducted a test yesterday. Thats why the city had to be under isolation."  
"说东京-3 地下有一个秘密军事组织，昨天进行了测试。这就是为什么城市必须处于隔离状态。"

Shinji let out a sigh of relief.  
真嗣松了一口气。

"And that they supposedly tested some giant robot."  
"据说他们测试了某种巨型机器人。"

Shinji sigh seemed to be sucked back in as Kensuke's words hit his ears. "Err, know. I didn't hear that," he said sheepishly.  
听到 Kensuke 的话，Shinji 的叹息仿佛被吸了回去。“呃，不知道。我没听说过，”他有些尴尬地说。

"It seems to be a big story, I just wonder how much is true. Oh what I would give to get a picture of one."  
"这听起来像是个大新闻，我只是好奇有多少是真的。哦，要是我能拍到一张照片就好了。"

Shinji thought it was time to steer the conversation away from dangerous waters and said quiet bluntly without meaning to. "Who is that blue haired girl that just showed up today?"  
真嗣觉得是时候把话题从危险的水域引开了，于是不经意间直截了当地问道：“今天刚来的那个蓝发女孩是谁？”

Kensuke looked puzzled for a minute before snickering slightly and smiling at Shinji. "I thought I caught you looking at her, what outgrew Asuka already?"  
剑介困惑了一会儿，随即轻笑起来，对着真嗣微笑道：“我就知道你注意到她了，这么快就对明日香没兴趣了？”

Shinji was slightly annoyed, more for the fact of suggesting him and Asuka having sex then him interested in the blue haired girl.  
真嗣有些不悦，更多的是因为剑介暗示他和明日香有性关系，而不是他对蓝发女孩感兴趣。

Passing it off he said, "I'd never live through it. No I was just curious is all. I've been here for almost a month now and I just noticed her today. Has she been here always?"  
他推脱道：“我可受不了那种事。不，我只是好奇罢了。我在这里已经快一个月了，今天才注意到她。她一直都在这儿吗？”

Kensuke shrugged, "Yeah but she seems to disappear for a while and then just comes back one day. Sometimes she's injured, other times she's fine. No idea what's up with her. She keeps to herself and hardly talks to anyone."  
健助耸了耸肩，“是啊，但她似乎会消失一段时间，然后某天又突然回来。有时她受伤了，有时又安然无恙。不知道她怎么回事。她总是独来独往，几乎不和任何人说话。”

"So what's her name then?"  
“那她叫什么名字？”

"Err...Ayanami Rei, I think."  
"呃...我想是绫波零。"

"Ayanami Rei?" "绫波零？"

"Yeah, its the first time I can remember seeing her in a few months."  
"是啊，这是我这几个月来第一次记得见到她。"

Shinji couldn't think of anything to say at this point and lapsed into silence. So her name was Ayanami Rei and she was also an Eva pilot. Chances are then that he'd see her later again.  
此时，真嗣想不出该说什么，便陷入了沉默。原来她的名字是绫波零，也是一位 EVA 驾驶员。那么，他很可能会再次见到她。

Kensuke appeared to be done with his lunch and Touji had finished his in record time. Standing up Kensuke said, "I guess I'll see you in class then, Shinji."  
健司似乎已经吃完了午餐，而阿薰更是以创纪录的速度解决了他的那份。站起来后，健司说道：“那我们课堂上见，真嗣。”

"Yeah cya," said Shinji who was absorbed in his own thoughts.  
“嗯，再见。”真嗣沉浸在自己的思绪中，随口应道。

After the two stooges left Shinji flung himself on his back as he looked up at the clouds. Reflecting back on what had happened the past week his life had definitely taken a turn, but in which direction. Compared to what it used to be he supposed that it was better. He had a decent home with a nice roommate...and a not so nice roommate, well usually. And he had started to get used to peoples company.  
在两个笨蛋离开后，真嗣仰面躺下，望着天上的云朵。回想起过去一周发生的事情，他的生活无疑发生了转变，但转向何方呢？与过去相比，他觉得现在好多了。他有了一个不错的家，和一个好室友……以及一个不那么好的室友，嗯，通常情况下。而且，他开始习惯了与人相处。

Though everything bad that he had seen, the Eva, angels, the visions, the damn visions. What in the hell we're they really? Premonitions about the future, or events that may or might not happen, and why him? What did he do to make this happen to himself? A book certainly couldn't tell Shinji what he wanted to know.  
尽管他看到了所有糟糕的事情，EVA、使徒、那些该死的幻象。它们到底是什么鬼东西？关于未来的预感，还是可能发生或不发生的事件，为什么是他？他做了什么让自己遭遇这些？一本书当然无法告诉真嗣他想知道的。

Then there was Eva Unit 01, his Eva he supposed, as it wouldn't let anyone else pilot it but him. It was obviously different then the other Eva's but in what way. Did the others hear a voice every time they got in that entry plug? Did they connect physically and mentally with the Eva every time they piloted it? Shinji rather doubted it.  
还有 EVA 初号机，他觉得那是他的 EVA，因为它只允许他一个人驾驶。它显然与其他 EVA 不同，但具体是哪里不同呢？其他人每次进入驾驶舱时也会听到声音吗？他们每次驾驶时都能与 EVA 在身体和精神上建立联系吗？真嗣对此相当怀疑。

"To many questions," he mumbled out loud to nobody but himself. Or at least he thought.  
“太多问题了，”他喃喃自语，除了自己别无他人。或者至少他是这么认为的。

"Does it hurt," asked a calm voice?  
“疼吗？”一个平静的声音问道。

Shinji almost had a heart attack as he bolted upright. Standing several feet in front of him was Ayanami Rei and once again she had a passive look on her face.  
真嗣差点吓得心脏停跳，猛地坐直了身子。站在他几英尺外的是绫波零，她的脸上再次露出了那种淡漠的表情。

Shinji gaped openly for a second or to and then closed his mouth. He had an urge to say something funny but couldn't quite get his tongue to wrap around them.  
真嗣张口结舌了一会儿，然后才闭上了嘴。他有种想说些俏皮话的冲动，但舌头就是不听使唤。

"Hey what's up?" He asked in a feeble attempted at a conversation.  
“嘿，怎么了？”他试图展开对话，语气却显得无力。

She continued to look passively back at him without any sign of emotion. Shinji was starting to get annoyed.  
她继续面无表情地看着他，没有任何情绪的迹象。真嗣开始感到烦躁。

Sitting up he said, "Look, if you don't have anything to say then I'm heading back to class."  
他坐起身来说道：“听着，如果你没什么要说的，那我就回教室了。”

Shinji then pushed himself up and walked past her. At first he thought that she was going to stop him and he hesitated for a fraction of a second, but then continued walking past her. However when he was about to reach for the door nob to take him to the stairwell she finally opened up.  
随后，真嗣站起身来，从她身边走过。起初他以为她会拦住他，犹豫了那么一瞬间，但随即继续向前走去。然而，当他伸手准备开门去楼梯间时，她终于开口了。

"Are you going to continued piloting Eva?"  
“你还会继续驾驶 EVA 吗？”

Shinji wheeled around and was unsurprised to see that she still hadn't moved but was still standing in the same place, as though he had never moved. He was starting to get used to her weirdness.  
真嗣转过身来，并不意外地发现她依旧站在原地，仿佛他从未移动过。他开始习惯了她的古怪。

Wrenching open the door he paused in front of it and said, "Yeah."  
他用力拉开那扇门，在门前停顿了一下，说道：“嗯。”

Glancing briefly at her he didn't see any sign of change and let out a sigh. Had he been expecting something? Ignoring the thought he started walking back towards class.  
他匆匆瞥了她一眼，没发现任何变化，便叹了口气。他是否期待着什么？他没去多想，开始往教室走去。

The minute that Shinji walked into class Asuka threw him a dirty scowl, which he saw but ignored it. She could be so childish sometimes. However several seconds later her scowl intensified, as Shinji was walking back towards his desk, when Rei walked into the classroom. Asuka's imagination started to buzz rapidly as she thought of reasons why they were mere moments apart from walking into the class room. None of the conclusions she came up with satisfied her.  
真嗣一走进教室，明日香就朝他投去一个厌恶的眼神，他看到了却置之不理。她有时真是幼稚得可以。然而几秒钟后，她的怒容愈发加深，因为真嗣正走向自己的座位时，丽走进了教室。明日香的思绪开始飞速旋转，她想找出他们前后脚进教室的原因。但她想到的任何结论都无法令自己满意。

---

Many hour later school ended and Shinji was almost grateful, or would have been if he didn't have to climb into an Eva.  
许多小时后，学校终于放学了，真嗣几乎感到庆幸，如果不是还得爬进 Eva 的话，他本该如此。

The walk to Nerv was uneventful to say the least. He was right in assuming that Rei was a regular Eva pilot as she seemed to be going the same way as he and Asuka. Though it seemed that Asuka was determined that she was the leader as she continued to speed up every once in a while.  
前往 NERV 的步行至少可以说是不出所料的平静。他猜对了，丽确实是一名常规 Eva 驾驶员，因为她似乎和真嗣及明日香走的是同一条路。尽管明日香似乎决心要当领头人，时不时地加快步伐。

Shinji was nervous and it showed. His eyebrows were sweating and he was starting to bite his lip. He had a sudden urge then to ask Asuka some things about the tests that he would be going through soon. Speeding up, he was still determined though to stand far enough back so that he would be able to avoid a punch from her if she got angry. Still unsure if this was even smart he opened his mouth and said, "Hey Asuka can I ask you something?"  
真嗣显得很紧张，这一点显而易见。他的眉头冒着汗，开始咬起了嘴唇。他突然有种冲动，想向明日香询问一些关于即将进行的测试的事情。他加快了脚步，但仍决心保持足够的距离，以防她生气时能避开她的拳头。尽管不确定这样做是否明智，他还是张开嘴说道：“嘿，明日香，我能问你点事吗？”

She ignored him like he thought. It was worth a shot, but he still had an idea.  
她像他预想的那样无视了他。虽然值得一试，但他还有个主意。

Laying the respect on a bit thick he said, "Asuka please, you've been doing this a lot longer than I have. I want to know what to expect from these tests since you've had much more experience than I have."  
他略显夸张地表达着敬意，说道：“明日香，请告诉我，你比我有更长的经验。我想知道这些测试会有什么，毕竟你比我经验丰富得多。”

Shinji was counting on Asuka's pride as an Eva pilot that she would answer his questions. It seemed to work.  
真嗣寄希望于明日香作为 EVA 驾驶员的骄傲，相信她会回答他的问题。看来这招奏效了。

She glanced behind at him quickly with a frown on her face as though still unsure if she was angry at him or not. 'Oh what the hell. I do have the best combat record,' she thought.  
她迅速回头瞥了他一眼，眉头紧皱，似乎还在犹豫自己是否还在生他的气。'管他呢，我的战斗记录可是最好的，'她心想。

"The tests are simple enough, at least most of them. Today will be nothing more than a synchronization test."  
“这些测试很简单，至少大部分是。今天不过是同步率测试而已。”

"And what does that mean?" Shinji didn't want to ask to much and anger her so he thought to ask the basics only.  
"那是什么意思？" 真嗣不想问得太多而激怒她，所以他只问了最基本的问题。

"For an idiot like you it means nothing more than becoming used to being in the entry plug."  
"对你这样的傻瓜来说，这不过意味着习惯了进入插入栓而已。"

Shinji wanted to throw back a retort but thought better and bit his tongue, at least they were talking now.  
真嗣本想反驳，但转念一想还是咬住了舌头，至少现在他们开始交谈了。

"So we won't be doing any simulations?"  
"所以我们不进行任何模拟训练吗？"

"No! You won't be for a while. You're barely able to synchronize with your Eva. It'll take you months to get to the level that I'm at."  
"不！你暂时不会进行。你与 Eva 的同步率还很低。要达到我现在的水平，你需要几个月的时间。"

"And what about Rei?" "那丽怎么样？"

Asuka's mood turned sour at her name and spun around and Shinji was glad that he had maintained a good distance between them as she looked like she was ready to hit him.  
听到自己的名字，明日香的心情顿时变糟，她转过身来，真嗣庆幸自己和她保持了足够的距离，因为她看起来像是要揍他。

"What about her!" “她怎么了！”

"Nothing, I just wondered how long she had been a pilot is all."  
“没什么，我只是好奇她当驾驶员多久了。”

Asuka glared at him before turning around and stomping off, "Ask her yourself you dumb ass!"  
明日香瞪了他一眼，然后转身跺脚离去，“你自己问她啊，你这个笨蛋！”

Shinji was left standing still on the sidewalk with a frown on his face. 'So much for the brief minutes of talking,' he thought before catching up to her slightly.  
真嗣站在人行道上，眉头紧锁。‘短暂的交谈就这样结束了，’他想着，然后稍微加快脚步追上了她。

Shinji was thoroughly glad that he had Asuka and Rei with him, he would never be able to find his way in Nerv. All the crisscrossing hallways made him nauseous. Then he remembered that his father was somewhere in this mess and felt like puking even more.  
真嗣非常庆幸有明日香和绫波在他身边，否则他绝对无法在 NERV 里找到路。那些纵横交错的走廊让他感到恶心。接着他想起父亲也在这片混乱之中，更觉得想吐了。

---

After what seemed like an hour they walked into a room similar to the one that Shinji had been in previously. Except this one had a window that showed the three Eva's lined up next to each other waiting for there pilots. Shinji guess that this is where they would be syncing. Next second it was confirmed when he heard a familiar voice.  
仿佛过了一个小时，他们走进了一个与之前真嗣待过的类似的房间。只是这个房间有一扇窗户，窗外排列着三台 EVA，它们并排等待着各自的驾驶员。真嗣猜测这里就是他们进行同步的地方。下一秒，这个猜测就被一个熟悉的声音证实了。

"Glad you could make it Shinji."  
“很高兴你能来，真嗣。”

Shinji turned around to see a smiling Misato standing in front of him.  
真嗣转过身，看到米萨托站在他面前，面带微笑。

Shinji grinned, but it was rather strained. Misato seemed to notice this and said, "Don't worry you'll be fine."  
真嗣勉强笑了笑，但显得有些僵硬。美里似乎注意到了这一点，说道：“别担心，你会没事的。”

"Yeah..." "是啊..."

"Everything is ready so just go change into your plug suits and we can get this over with."  
“一切都准备好了，快去换上插入栓服，我们尽快搞定这件事。”

Asuka and Rei seemed to understand her words because they left through a door to the left leaving Shinji standing there confused.  
明日香和绫波似乎理解了她的意思，因为他们穿过左边的一扇门离开了，留下真嗣站在那里一脸困惑。

"Err Misato, what do you mean by plug suits?"  
"Misato 小姐，你说的插入栓服是什么意思？"

Misato let out a small oh as if she had forgotten something, which she did. "I completely forgot that you haven't even piloted in a plug suit before which is surprising. It shows your potential as a pilot."  
Misato 轻声‘哦’了一下，仿佛忘记了什么，她的确忘了。“我完全忘了你之前连插入栓服都没穿过，这真是令人惊讶。这显示了你作为驾驶员的潜力。”

Shinji wasn't sure that was a complement or not so just let her continue.  
真嗣不确定这是不是在夸他，所以只是让她继续说下去。

"Anyway take that door at your right in the far corner and find a locker that says Shinji on it. I think the number was 203, or something."  
“总之，走到右边的角落，那扇门进去，找一个标有‘真嗣’的储物柜。我想号码是 203，或者是别的什么。”

"But what is a plug suit?"  
“但什么是插入栓服？”

Misato frowned, "I knew that you and Asuka hadn't been getting along but I assumed that she'd explain some things to you."  
美里皱眉道：“我知道你和明日香相处得不好，但我以为她会向你解释一些事情。”

"I really hadn't tried, its better to let her cool off instead of forcing her to."  
"我真的没试过，让她冷静一下比强迫她要好。"

"Well, anyway, in simple terms the plug suit synchronizes you with your Eva. However the fact that you are able to sync with your Eva...by other methods means that maybe you wont have to use one. This is still all just tests. Oh and there be some blue clips in their also, put those on your head."  
"总之，简单来说，插入栓服能让你与 EVA 同步。不过，既然你能通过其他方法与 EVA 同步，或许你就不必使用它了。这一切都还在测试阶段。哦，还有，里面会有一些蓝色夹子，把它们戴在头上。"

Shinji tried to keep all this in his head, as he followed Misato's instructions.  
真嗣努力记住这一切，同时按照美里小姐的指示行动。

After several annoying minutes of getting used to the fabric which was unbearably tight after pressing a button he found that Misato had failed to mention Shinji walked out of the boys locker room, clipping the nerve receptors onto his head.  
经过几分钟令人烦躁的适应，那布料紧得让人难以忍受，他按下了一个按钮，发现美里忘记告诉他的事情——真嗣走出了男更衣室，将神经感受器夹在头上。

Shinji had admit-tingly thought that Asuka was cute when he had first seen her, and had realized that she was even more attractive now that he got to know her, this however blew him away. He hadn't even thought about the fact that she would be wearing a plug suit also and it hit him like a piano when he saw her in the bright red plug suit. It complemented her curves precisely and there was no lack of anything. He considered himself not overly perverted but this pushed the limits.  
真嗣不得不承认，第一次见到明日香时，他就觉得她很可爱，而现在了解她之后，他发现她更加迷人了，但这完全让他震惊。他甚至没想过她也会穿插入栓服，当看到她穿着鲜红色的插入栓服时，这感觉就像一架钢琴砸中了他。那紧身衣完美地衬托出她的曲线，没有任何不足之处。他自认不算过于好色，但这确实超出了他的极限。

Asuka must have caught him gaping openly because she tossed her hair behind her head and seemed to give a seducing smile towards him. This pulled Shinji out of his stupor and he had to curse himself slightly for his stupidity. It was obvious that she had been expecting this kind of reaction from him and was throughly enjoying it.  
明日香肯定注意到了他目瞪口呆的样子，因为她把头发甩到脑后，似乎对他露出了一个诱人的微笑。这让真嗣从恍惚中回过神来，他不得不暗自咒骂自己的愚蠢。显然，她早就预料到他会这样反应，并且乐在其中。

Determinedly wrenching his eyes away from her they instead settled on Rei. Her plug suit was more or less the same as his except more white while his was largely blue.  
他坚决地移开视线，不再看她，转而注视着丽。她的插入栓服和他的大致相同，只是白色部分更多，而他的则主要是蓝色。

Misato appeared to witness this whole ordeal and let it continue until things seemed to pass.  
美里似乎目睹了整个过程，任其继续，直到一切似乎都过去了。

"Now then you know what to do...Shinji just follow the girls and ask if you have any questions."  
“那么，你知道该怎么做...真嗣，跟着女孩们走，有任何问题就问。”

'Not like I'll get them answered if I ask,' he thought bitterly as he stared at Asuka's back.  
“问了也不会得到回答的。”他苦涩地想着，目光凝视着明日香的背影。

---

'So far so good,' Shinji thought as he finished strapping himself in to Eva Unit 01. Looking at the monitor he saw that Asuka and Rei had done likewise. Suddenly Misato's voice came over on the loud speaker.  
“目前为止一切顺利。”真嗣想着，完成了对 EVA 初号机的固定。他看向屏幕，发现明日香和绫波也已经准备就绪。突然，美里通过扩音器传来了声音。

"OK everything is ready on our end. Go ahead and start concentrating you guys. I want to get this done as quickly as possible."  
“好了，我们这边已经准备妥当。你们开始集中精神吧。我希望尽快完成这件事。”

Shinji assumed that she was worried about him and rather thankful at that. Gathering everything that he could remember during his past fights in the Eva he closed his eyes and solely concentrated on something he never thought he would, syncing with the voice that had plagued his dreams.  
真嗣猜测她是在担心他，并且对此颇为感激。他集中精力，回忆起过去在 EVA 战斗中的点点滴滴，闭上眼睛，全神贯注于一个他从未想过会去关注的事物——与那个困扰他梦境的声音同步。

Almost immediately he heard a small whisper and soon it developed into a strong voice.  
几乎立刻，他听到了一个微弱的低语，很快这声音变得强烈起来。

"_Glad your finally getting the time to get to know me better."_  
“很高兴你终于有时间更好地了解我了。”

Shinji was quiet as he didn't want anything to interfere with his thought process.  
真嗣保持沉默，不想让任何事情干扰他的思考过程。

"_Thats rather rude, ignoring me like that. What, did your parents never teach you any manners?"_  
“那样无视我真是太没礼貌了。怎么，你父母没教过你礼貌吗？”

Something sparked in Shinji's mind, but he was quickly able to pass it off. However it was noticed in the command room.  
真嗣脑海中闪过一丝念头，但他很快就能将其抛诸脑后。然而，这一细微变化在指挥室中被察觉到了。

"Anomaly detected in Unit 01."  
"发现 01 号单元异常。"

Misato immediately spun in the direction of the voice and barked. "What is it?"  
美里立刻转向声音的方向，厉声问道：“怎么回事？”

"Wait...nothing, it disappeared."  
"等等……没事了，它消失了。"

Misato frowned worriedly and said, "Keep an eye on Unit 01 and let me know if anything changes."  
美里皱着眉头担忧地说：“盯紧零号机，有任何变化立刻通知我。”

"Yes ma'am!" “是的，女士！”

Back in Unit 01 Shinji was starting to sweat from concentrating, that and the voice was really starting to get on his nerves.  
回到零号机内，真嗣因为集中精神而开始出汗，再加上那个声音真的开始让他烦躁起来。

"_So ready for the next angel attack? I know I am. Just let me know and I'll rip it to shreds. What I wouldn't give for a good blood bath right now."_  
“准备好迎接下一个使徒了吗？我知道我准备好了。告诉我，我会把它撕成碎片。我现在多么渴望好好洗个血浴啊。”

"Shut...it," whispered Shinji.  
"闭...嘴，" 真嗣低声说道。

"_Here I am trying to strike up a conversation with you and thats all you can say, phish, ass."_  
"我在这里努力想和你聊聊天，你就只能说这些，真是的，笨蛋。"

Shinji then started to talk to the voice deep in his subconscious. "Okay fine, we'll talk."  
真嗣随后开始与深藏在他潜意识中的那个声音对话。"好吧，好吧，我们聊聊。"

"_Good, because its boring if you don't."_  
"很好，因为如果你不这样做，那就太无聊了。"

"What or who are you?"  
"你是什么，或者你是谁？"

"_The thing that lives inside of the Eva."_  
"住在 Eva 里面的那个东西。"

Shinji was startled by this new streak of information and it showed with his sync ratio.  
这条新信息让真嗣吓了一跳，这从他的同步率中显露无遗。

Gaining control of his thoughts he said, "What do you mean the thing that lives inside the Eva?"  
他控制住自己的思绪，说道：“你说的‘住在 Eva 里的东西’是什么意思？”

"_Those humans don't tell you much do they."_  
“那些人类没告诉你多少，是吧。”

Shinji didn't want to admit it but the voice was right. "I never asked, but what are you."  
真嗣不想承认，但那个声音是对的。“我从没问过，但你是什么？”

"_An entity, thats good enough for now."_  
“一个存在，目前这样就足够了。”

"Fine, why me?" “好吧，为什么是我？”

"_You intrigue me, simple enough. You're different then all the other humans that have ever piloted me. At first I thought about killing you but after looking inside of your soul I learned a few things about you that made me curious."_  
"你引起了我的兴趣，就这么简单。你和其他所有曾经驾驶过我的人类都不同。起初我想过要杀掉你，但在窥视你的灵魂之后，我发现了关于你的几件事，让我感到好奇。"

"And those things are?" "那些事是什么？"

"_Stuff that you wouldn't want to know. Put it this way, your better of not knowing."_  
"你不会想知道的那些事。这么说吧，不知道对你更好。"

"And if I still want to know?"  
"如果我仍然想知道呢？"

"_Most likely you'll go insane from it and thats not happening anytime soon. I need you sane, so don't even ask."_  
"最有可能的是，你会因此发疯，而且这不会很快发生。我需要你保持理智，所以别再问了。"

"Fine then do you have anything to do with the visions that I am having. Ever since I pilot you the first time I've been having visions of people that I know or events that may or not happen. I damn sick of them."  
"好吧，那你和我的那些幻觉有关系吗？自从我第一次驾驶你以来，我就一直在看到我认识的人或可能发生的事件。我他妈的受够了这些。"

"_I can't control things that happen outside of this small space, so I have no idea what your babbling about."_  
"我无法掌控这个小空间之外的事情，所以你说的那些我一无所知。"

"Fine, thanks for nothing."  
"好吧，谢了，啥也没帮上。"

"_Anytime."_ "随时乐意。"

Shinji lapsed into silence as he felt his conscious slide back to where he currently was. Opening one of his eyes he glanced at a screen to his right and saw Asuka with her eyes closed doing the same thing that he was doing. Unable to hold back the smirk after getting another look at her red plug suit he turned away quickly so as to not interrupt his concentration.  
真嗣陷入了沉默，他的意识逐渐回到了当前所在之处。他睁开一只眼睛，瞥向右侧的屏幕，看到明日香闭着眼睛，做着和他一样的事情。再次看到她那红色插入栓服后，他忍不住露出了微笑，但很快又转过头去，以免打断自己的专注。

Then, the pain hit him. Shinji felt like his mind was going to split down the middle as reality was torn from him. Flashes passed him as he saw a dark room with the walls lit up in red, a sea the color of blood, his mother who he could barely remember smiling back at him before she turned into a creature with no face. Nothing was real and everyone was gone. It was just Shinji inside the entry plug of Eva Unit 01 screaming like he was wounded.  
随后，疼痛袭来。真嗣感觉自己的意识仿佛要被撕裂，现实从他身边被剥离。闪回的画面掠过眼前：一个黑暗的房间，墙壁被红色照亮，一片血色的海洋，他几乎记不清的母亲微笑着回头看他，随即变成了一只没有面孔的生物。一切都不真实，所有人都消失了。只剩下真嗣在 EVA 初号机的插入栓内，像受伤一样尖叫。

Misato reacted quickly at the first sound of Shinji's screams. "Disengage the umbilical cords for all three Eva's, and get Rei and Asuka out of there as quickly as possible. Status of Eva Unit 01?"  
听到真嗣的尖叫声，美里迅速做出反应。“立即断开三台 EVA 的脐带电缆，尽快将绫波和明日香带出来。初号机的状态如何？”

"Pilot live signs are fluctuating abnormally. The LCL fluid inside the entry plug is heating up, passing normal temperatures...critical reached."  
"驾驶员生命迹象异常波动。插入栓内的 LCL 液体温度升高，超过正常值...已达到临界点。"

"Entry plug removal for Unit 00 and Unit 02 have been confirmed, pilots safe."  
"零号机与二号机的插入栓已确认移除，驾驶员安全。"

"Get them the hell out of there! Try removing the entry plug for Unit 01."  
"立刻把他们带出来！尝试移除初号机的插入栓。"

"Negative it will not recognize the signature."  
"负面的，它无法识别签名。"

Misato bit her nail in fear. When someone alerted her of something important.  
美里紧张地咬着指甲。当有人向她报告重要事情时。

"Commander Misato you might want to look at this."  
"美里指挥官，您可能需要看看这个。"

"What," she snapped. "什么，"她厉声道。

"Its Unit 01's sync rate."  
"这是 01 号机的同步率。"

Misato was over there in a flash and froze when she saw the synchronization between the pilot and the Eva. It was fluctuating from plus one hundred to negative one hundred something that had never been seen before.  
Misato 瞬间冲了过去，当她看到驾驶员与 Eva 之间的同步率时，整个人都僵住了。同步率从正一百波动到负一百多，这种从未见过的现象让她震惊不已。

In a shaky voice Misato managed to get the words out, "Record this...for future reference."  
美里用颤抖的声音勉强说出：“记录下来……以备将来参考。”

"Yes ma'am." “是，长官。”

Getting a hold of her feelings for Shinji who's screams had subsided she looked back at the screen where his life signs were unknown.  
她努力控制住对真嗣的情感，他的尖叫声已经平息，她回头看向屏幕，那里显示着他的生命迹象未知。

"Does Unit 01 appear to be going berserk."  
"初号机似乎要暴走了。"

"It does not appear to be so."  
"看起来并非如此。"

Misato bit her nail again and said, "Get a team down there to restrain the Eva, and if you see any signs of movement get the hell back here. I don't want anyones life in danger."  
美里再次咬了咬指甲，说道：“派一支队伍下去制服 Eva，一旦发现任何动静，立刻撤回来。我不想任何人冒生命危险。”

At this moment Asuka came bursting into the command room with Rei behind her with a somewhat passive look.  
就在这时，明日香猛地冲进了指挥室，身后跟着表情略显被动的绫波。

"What the hell is going on, why did you call of the tests!"  
“到底怎么回事，为什么取消了测试！”

Misato did not want to deal with this right now and ignored Asuka who was not happy about it.  
美里现在不想处理这些，她无视了不满的明日香。

"Misato what is going on!"  
"美里，这是怎么回事！"

"Shinji's life is currently in danger and we are trying to recover him, that is the current situation!"  
"真嗣的生命现在处于危险之中，我们正在设法救他，这就是目前的状况！"

Asuka was slightly taken back as Misato had never snapped at her like that before. Her mood changed from one to anger to one of slight worry. "Is he okay?"  
明日香有些惊讶，因为美里以前从未这样对她发过脾气。她的情绪从愤怒转变为一丝担忧。"他没事吧？"

"I don't know but the last reading we got the temperature in Unit 01 was well over one hundred twenty degrees Fahrenheit. Since then its most likely climbed. Then...then there's his syncro rate. At times it was in the negatives which is supposed to be impossible and then it would jump up to a hundred which is equally impossible. Its like the Eva wants to kill him but is having second thoughts."  
"我不知道，但上次我们测得 01 号机内的温度已经超过了一百二十华氏度。从那以后很可能还在上升。然后...然后是他的同步率。有时会降到负值，这本应是不可能的，然后又会突然飙升到百分百，同样是不可能的。就好像 Eva 想要杀了他，却又犹豫不决。"

All Asuka could mange was a slight, "Oh." Finding a nearby chair she let herself sink into it and look up at the monitor which was fuzzy.  
明日香只能勉强发出一声轻微的“哦”。她找到附近的一把椅子，让自己沉入其中，抬头看着那模糊的显示屏。

Turning back towards the problem Misato said on the loud speaker, "How does it look down there?"  
米莎托转回面对问题，通过扩音器说道：“下面情况怎么样？”

"Nothing's wrong, Unit 01 is showing no signs of moving, proceeding with containment and the rescuing of the pilot."  
“一切正常，初号机没有任何动静，继续进行收容并营救驾驶员。”

Misato let out a strangled sigh and sank into a seat near her. Soon it would be all over and they'd be able to brush it off as a minor incident. But she knew it wasn't the case this time. If the Eva continued to do this to Shinji then she wouldn't be able to sit by and watch it.  
美里发出一声窒息般的叹息，瘫坐在她旁边的座位上。很快这一切就会结束，他们可以将其视为一个小插曲抛诸脑后。但她知道这次情况不同。如果 Eva 继续这样对待真嗣，她无法袖手旁观。

After several tense minutes of praying that nothing would go wrong the team on the floor managed to manually extract the entry plug from the Eva. LCL fluid poured from the open entry plug and Misato stood up and almost rushed down to the floor.  
在紧张地祈祷了几分钟后，地面上的团队终于手动从 Eva 中取出了插入栓。LCL 液体从打开的插入栓中涌出，美里站起身来，几乎要冲下楼去。

"We've got him, he's unconscious but miraculously alive."  
"我们抓到他了，他昏迷不醒但奇迹般地还活着。"

Misato let out a strangled sigh and suddenly felt like having several beers. It had been to close.  
美里发出一声哽咽的叹息，突然很想喝几杯啤酒。刚才真是太险了。

"There's something though, while the LCL was close to two hundred degrees in there his body is oddly cold. The only thing the LCL fluid seemed to destroy was his plug suit."  
"不过有件事很奇怪，尽管 LCL 温度接近两百度，他的身体却异常冰冷。LCL 液体似乎只破坏了他的插入栓服。"

"So what he's naked?" "他光着身子又怎么了？"

"...Well, yeah." "...嗯，是啊。"

Misato could have almost laughed. "Take him to the emergency room. I'll have doctor Akagi be ready for you when you get there."  
美里几乎要笑出声来。“带他去急诊室。我会让赤城医生准备好，等你们到了那里。”

Slouching deeper in her chair she spun around in her chair to see Asuka sitting there with her legs drawn up to her chest.  
她懒洋洋地陷进椅子里，转过身来看到明日香坐在那里，双腿蜷缩到胸前。

"Well he's okay," smiled Misato.  
“他没事，”美里微笑着说。

Asuka nodded in a forlorn sort of way. Misato had an idea though that might perk her up a little.  
明日香有些沮丧地点了点头。不过美里有个主意，或许能让她振作一点。

"Though I have no idea why, but he was for some reason naked in the entry plug when they found him. The LCL fluid burned off just the plug suit but his body was quite cold."  
虽然不知道为什么，但他们在插入栓里发现他时，他不知为何一丝不挂。LCL 液体只烧掉了插入栓服，但他的身体却异常冰冷。

Asuka's face turned a small shade of pink before she stood up and said, "Why the hell are you telling me something as disgusting as that. As if I'd want to know...how he was."  
明日香的脸微微泛红，然后站起来说：“你干嘛告诉我这么恶心的事。好像我想知道他怎么样似的……”

Misato let out the first smile since since the whole ordeal and stood up. "Well, lets at least be sure that he is completely okay before we start celebrating."  
美里在这场风波后第一次露出微笑，站起身来。“好吧，至少在我们开始庆祝之前，先确保他完全没事。”

Asuka snorted but followed her all the same.  
明日香哼了一声，但还是跟了上去。

---

"This is...familiar." “这地方……似曾相识。”

Shinji sat up in his hospital bed and felt his temples sear with pain. Whatever had happened it he couldn't remember anything. He remembered he had just taken a peek at Asuka before he blacked out. Now he was in a hospital room, naked, with a few chairs around his bed and his sheets bearing signs that someone had been sitting on them.  
真嗣在医院的病床上坐起身，感到太阳穴一阵剧痛。无论发生了什么，他都记不起来了。他只记得自己刚刚瞥了一眼明日香，然后就失去了意识。现在他躺在医院的病房里，一丝不挂，床边散落着几把椅子，床单上还留有被人坐过的痕迹。

"Looks like you finally woke up Shinji."  
"看来你终于醒了，真嗣。"

Shinji shifted so that he was facing the door and saw Ritsuko leaning against the wall with a cigarette in her hand.  
真嗣挪动身体，让自己面对着门，看到律子靠在墙上，手里夹着一支烟。

Shinji's first intentions where to ask what happened but Ritsuko beat him to it.  
真嗣本想问发生了什么，但律子抢先了一步。

"Don't worry about what happened, your safe and everybody's fine. You've been through a lot and are lucky to be alive. I'm keeping you here for two days at least to be sure. But I suppose I shouldn't badger you anymore, someone's been bothering me every few minutes to see if your awak-"  
"别担心发生了什么，你很安全，大家都没事。你经历了很多，能活下来真是幸运。我至少要留你在这里两天确保一切无恙。不过我想我不该再打扰你了，每隔几分钟就有人来问我你是否醒了……"

With that Ritsuko was pushed to the side as Misato darted into the room with a rather reluctant looking Asuka and a passive Rei in tow.  
说完这话，律子被推到一旁，美里冲进房间，身后跟着一脸不情愿的明日香和表情平静的丽。

"Shinji! Oh thank God you're okay. I knew it was a bad idea to have you do the tests."  
"真嗣！哦，感谢上帝你没事。我就知道让你去做那些测试是个坏主意。"

"Misato calm down, I'm fine."  
"美里，冷静点，我没事。"

"But you almost weren't, everyone was worried."  
"但你差点就出事了，大家都担心得要命。"

Shinji raised an eyebrow and looked over at Asuka who glared at him as though daring him to ask if she had been worried.  
真嗣挑了挑眉，看向明日香，她瞪着他，仿佛在挑衅他敢不敢问她是否也担心了。

"Glad that everyone was worried."  
"很高兴大家都这么担心。"

"Yes, well, I'm going to go ahead and have the commander pull you off of Unit 01. Its apparent that no one is able to handle it."  
"是的，好吧，我打算让指挥官把你从 01 号单位撤下来。显然没人能驾驭它。"

"No, I'm going to continue piloting it."  
"不，我要继续驾驶它。"

A long silence filled the room at Shinji's words. Misato was dumbfounded, even Asuka seemed to be surprised. Only Rei showed signs of knowing about his decision all along.  
在真嗣的话语落下后，房间里弥漫着长久的沉默。美里目瞪口呆，就连明日香也似乎感到惊讶。只有丽表现出早已知晓他决定的样子。

"But Shinji after what almost happened to you...I can't possibly put you inside that thing. What if something similar happens while in a battle."  
“但是，真嗣，经历了几乎丧命的危险后……我怎么可能再让你进入那东西里。万一战斗中发生类似的事情怎么办？”

Shaking his head Shinji said, "And what happens if you need help. I'm the only person who's ever been able to pilot it, besides I'm supposed to be dead now so for the fact that I survived I should be the pilot."  
真嗣摇摇头说：“如果你们需要帮助怎么办？我是唯一能驾驶它的人，而且我本该已经死了，既然我活了下来，我就应该成为驾驶员。”

Misato opened her mouth to argue again but Shinji cut her off. "I'm sorry Misato but I don't want it any other way. I want to help all I can and if piloting an Eva is what I can do I'll do it.  
美里张嘴还想争辩，但真嗣打断了她。“对不起，美里，但我不想有别的选择。我想尽我所能帮助大家，如果驾驶 Eva 是我能做到的，那我就去做。”

"Enough with the sympathy already," said an irritated Asuka. "He's healed and stubborn once again, can we leave now?"  
“别再同情了，”明日香不耐烦地说，“他已经痊愈又固执起来了，我们现在可以走了吗？”

"Don't act like you weren't worried Asuka," smirked Misato.  
“别装得你没担心过似的，明日香，”美里得意地笑道。

Asuka blinked, "Not a chance. Why would I worry about him?"  
明日香眨了眨眼，“没门儿。我干嘛要担心他？”

Shinji frowned at Asuka but ignored it. She'd always be the same, well he'd open up if she ever did.  
真嗣对明日香皱了皱眉，但没理会。她总是这样，如果她愿意敞开心扉，他也会的。

Misato sighed and said, "Fine we'll head home for now, but be back later with some fresh cooking. Hospital food can get sickening quickly."  
美里叹了口气说：“好吧，我们先回家，但晚点会带着新鲜烹饪的食物回来。医院的食物很快就会让人反胃。”

Asuka suddenly realized that she'd have to survive two days without Shinji to cook for her. Glaring at him in an annoyed sort of way as though it was his fault he was injured she mouthed, "Get well soon, or I'll be dead of food poisoning before you get back."  
明日香突然意识到，她得在没有真嗣做饭的情况下熬过两天。她恼怒地瞪着他，仿佛是他受伤的错，然后无声地说：“快点好起来，不然你回来之前我就要死于食物中毒了。”

Shinji smiled and mouthed, "Will do," back.  
真嗣微笑着，无声地回应：“会的。”

Asuka's face seemed to twitch slightly as she appeared to be working up the power for a smile. Though halfway through it turned into more of a grimace at which point she turned around quickly and stormed out of the room.  
明日香的脸似乎微微抽搐了一下，她似乎在努力挤出一个微笑。但笑到一半变成了苦笑，于是她迅速转身，气冲冲地走出了房间。

Misato and Shinji frowned at her but both started laughing silently. Regaining control of herself Misato said, "Don't pay to much attention to what Asuka says Shinji, she was worried, just didn't want to show it."  
美里和真嗣对她皱了皱眉，但两人都默默地笑了起来。美里恢复了镇定，说道：“别太在意明日香说的话，真嗣，她只是担心，只是不想表现出来。”

"I've long since realized that."  
“我早就意识到了。”

"Well, you seem fine so no point in taking anymore time. I'm sure Ritsuko will want to run some more tests on you so I won't get in her way anymore."  
“嗯，你看起来没事了，再花时间也没意义。我相信律子会想再给你做些检查，我就不再妨碍她了。”

"Thanks, Misato." "谢谢你，美里。"

"Don't worry about it. I am your guardian after all."  
"别担心。我毕竟是你的守护者。"

That ment a lot to Shinji but he wasn't about to say that. He still had trouble expressing his feelings sometimes.  
这对真嗣意义重大，但他并不打算说出口。他有时仍难以表达自己的情感。

"I'll see you later today then, with dinner."  
"那我们今天晚些时候见，一起吃晚饭。"

Shinji tried to not look sick, "Okay I'll be waiting."  
真嗣努力不让自己看起来想吐，“好的，我会等着。”

When Misato left the room Shinji was about to roll onto his side and fall back asleep when he realized that not everyone had left the room.  
当美里离开房间后，真嗣正要翻身继续睡，却意识到并非所有人都离开了房间。

"Why did you decide to continue piloting it," asked Rei?  
“你为什么决定继续驾驶它？”绫波问道。

Shinji sat up slowly and looked at her curiously. Since he had met Ayanami Rei he had only ever seen her talk to himself. Shrugging Shinji said, "I don't know. I feel like I'll regret it if I don't do something I guess."  
真嗣缓缓坐起身，好奇地看着她。自从遇见绫波零以来，他只见过她对自己说话。真嗣耸耸肩说：“我不知道。我觉得如果我不做点什么，我会后悔的。”

"So you're doing because you want to, not because other people have told you to."  
“所以你这么做是因为你想做，而不是因为别人叫你做。”

Shinji replied slowly, "Yes other people have asked me to but its still my decision to pilot it."  
真嗣缓缓回答：“是的，虽然别人请求过我，但驾驶它仍然是我的决定。”

"Are you sure about that?"  
"你确定吗？"

"I'm me. How can I not be sure about the things that I decide?"  
"我就是我。我怎么可能不确定自己决定的事情呢？"

Rei then lapsed into silence as though not sure how to continue.  
丽随后陷入了沉默，仿佛不确定如何继续。

"If your done with questioning me I'd be thankful if you left so I can get some sleep."  
"如果你问完了，我感激你离开，让我能睡一会儿。"

Rei looked at him curiously for a second and then quietly excused herself from his room.  
丽好奇地看了他一眼，然后悄悄地离开了他的房间。

Shinji then rolled over onto his side and closed his eyes. However whenever he would he saw the horrible things that were shown to him in the entry plug. He ended up not sleeping that night.  
真嗣随后侧身躺下，闭上了眼睛。然而，每当他试图入睡时，驾驶舱里看到的可怕景象就会浮现在他眼前。那一晚，他彻夜未眠。

### Chapter 6: Past and Present  
第六章：过去与现在  

Shinji was released from the hospital earlier then expected as he had recovered surprisingly quickly and he didn't show any signs of mental contamination. So Misato quickly ran home and dropped him off before rushing back to Nerv saying that she'd be working late again and to worry about making enough food for her.  
真嗣比预期更早出院，因为他恢复得惊人地快，并且没有表现出任何精神污染的迹象。于是，美里急忙跑回家把他放下，然后又匆匆赶回 NERV，说她又要工作到很晚，并叮嘱他为她准备足够的食物。

Shinji was rather hesitant as he stood outside of Misato's apartment. He hadn't talked to Asuka since he had been admitted to the hospital and was worried if she'd blow up in his face. Though he was saved the need to as the door came flying open and almost hit him in the face.  
真嗣站在美里小姐的公寓外，显得颇为犹豫。自从他住院以来，还没和明日香说过话，担心她会突然发火。然而，他还没来得及敲门，门就猛地被撞开，差点撞到他的脸。

"About time your back, I though I was going to die."  
“你总算回来了，我还以为我要死了呢。”

Shinji looked up and turned his head quickly as he got a glimpse of Asuka who was in nothing but a red towel. Shinji tried desperately not to think about her in her plug suit then. Asuka however noticed him turn away quickly and looked down at herself apparently just realizing what she was wearing.  
真嗣抬头迅速瞥了一眼，只见明日香只裹着一条红色毛巾。他拼命不去想她穿着插入栓服的样子。然而，明日香注意到他迅速转过头去，低头看了看自己，显然是刚刚意识到自己穿了什么。

"Ah never seen a girl this close to being naked? Turns you on a little doesn't it?"  
"啊，没见过女孩穿得这么少吗？是不是有点让你心动了？"

Shinji didn't want to admit that what she said was true so he just pushed past her. "Just get dressed already, I don't know what you're thinking opening the door while wearing nothing but a towel."  
真嗣不想承认她的话是真的，所以他只是推开她。“快点穿好衣服，我不知道你在想什么，只裹着一条毛巾就开门。”

"If it wasn't you or Misato I would have simply kicked them in the balls, course I might do the same to you anyway."  
“如果不是你或美里，我早就一脚踢过去了，当然，对你我可能也会这么做。”

Shinji whipped around and faced her. Asuka was rather startled but stood her ground. "What!"  
真嗣猛地转过身面对她。明日香颇为吃惊，但还是站稳了脚跟。“什么！”

Shinji glared at her for a moment but sighed and said, "Sorry, I'm just a little agitated is all."  
真嗣瞪了她一会儿，然后叹了口气说：“对不起，我只是有点烦躁而已。”

"I suppose I'd be annoyed too if I had to stay two days stuck in that damn hospital room. Anyway I'm sick of take out food and microwaved meals, I want some real food."  
“我想如果我得在那个该死的医院房间里呆上两天，我也会很烦的。不管怎样，我吃腻了外卖和微波炉食品，我想吃点真正的食物。”

"Hai, I'll get started." "嗨，我这就开始。"

"Good, and don't-" "好，还有别——"

"No way in hell would I peek, just move it!"  
"地狱里都没门我会偷看，快挪开！"

Asuka was startled by his outburst and slightly rebuked herself for egging him on. Shrugging she let it drop and walked into her room.  
明日香被他的爆发吓了一跳，暗自责备自己不该激他。她耸耸肩，不再追究，走进了自己的房间。

"Well, I suppose its adequate to say the least," said Asuka as soon as she finished Shinji's cooking which consisted of her favorite: Sauerkraut.  
“好吧，至少可以说还算过得去。”明日香一吃完真嗣做的饭就说道，那里面有她最喜欢的酸菜。

Shinji almost snorted. He knew that it was more then adequate and that she had almost been starving herself for two days.  
真嗣差点笑出声来。他知道那不仅仅是过得去，她几乎已经饿了两天。

"When is Misato supposed to be home anyway," asked Asuka?  
"Misato 到底什么时候该回家来着？" 明日香问道。

"No idea. Late tonight I think."  
"不知道。我想应该是今晚很晚吧。"

"Great, well no way am I going to stay here with you."  
"太好了，那我可不打算和你一起待在这儿。"

"Fine, leave for all I care."  
“好啊，你走吧，我才不在乎。”

Asuka hadn't really been serious when she had said that she was leaving, she just wanted to see what Shinji's reaction would have been. Though from his reaction she guessed that he really didn't care and was slightly hurt by that.  
明日香当时说离开并不是认真的，她只是想看看真嗣会有什么反应。但从他的反应来看，她猜他真的不在乎，这让她有点受伤。

"Fine! If you don't care then I will leave!"  
“好！既然你不在乎，那我就走！”

Standing up abruptly she let her plate fall to the floor and storm off to her room where she tossed on a red sweatshirt with a hood.  
她猛地站起来，任由盘子掉落在地，气冲冲地跑回房间，套上一件带帽子的红色运动衫。

Shinji had half a mind to stop her and was just about to say he was sorry when she stormed out of her room before pausing and throwing a dirty scowl in his direction. As she turned around Shinji lunged forward and grabbed her wrist and waited for her reaction as she turned slowly around.  
真嗣本想拦住她，正要开口道歉，她却已经冲出房间，临走前还狠狠地瞪了他一眼。当她转身时，真嗣向前一扑，抓住了她的手腕，等待着她的反应，她缓缓转过身来。

"Let go damn it!" “放开我，该死的！”

Shinji hesitated but let his grip slack, and she was able to wrench her wrist free of his hand. Rubbing her wrist in a confused sort of way she looked back at Shinji who had his eyes angled towards the ground.  
真嗣犹豫了一下，但松开了手，她得以挣脱他的掌握。她困惑地揉着手腕，回头看向真嗣，他正目光低垂，盯着地面。

'What was that,' she thought? 'He actually seemed strong.'  
'刚才那是怎么回事？'她心想，'他看起来真的很有力量。'

Ignoring her thought she said. "What, do you want to say something?"  
她没理会自己的想法，问道："怎么，你想说什么吗？"

Shinji opened his mouth and closed it, unsure of how he should proceed.  
真嗣张开了嘴又合上，不确定该如何继续。

"If your not going to say anything then I'm leaving!"  
“如果你什么都不打算说，那我就走了！”

"Wait...Asuka." “等等……明日香。”

Asuka had her hand on the door nob as he said this and paused trying to decide whether she should listen or ignore him. She didn't really want to leave if she was honest with herself. Turning around slowly she said, "I'm listening."  
明日香手握在门把手上，听到这话时停了下来，试图决定是该听还是无视他。老实说，她并不真的想离开。她缓缓转过身，说道：“我在听。”

Shinji fidgeted slightly before looking up at her hesitantly. "I'm sorry for snapping at you..."  
真嗣稍微扭动了一下，然后犹豫地抬头看向她。“我为刚才对你发火道歉……”

"What was that?" "那是什么？"

"I'm sorry okay! I didn't mean what I said about not caring. Truth is I do."  
“对不起，好吗！我刚才说的不是真心话，关于不在乎的那部分。事实上，我确实在乎。”

Asuka frowned at him for a second before walking past him. Shinji winced slightly as he thought that he was going to get hit as she walked by but opened his eyes when he realized that she had already walked past. Sighing in a reassuring way he almost jumped several feet in the air as he heard her whisper behind him, "Good, because I didn't want to in the first place."  
明日香皱着眉头看了他一秒，然后从他身边走过。真嗣在她经过时微微缩了一下，以为会被打，但睁开眼时发现她已经走过去了。他松了一口气，几乎跳了起来，因为她在他身后低声说：“好，因为我一开始就不想这么做。”

Shinji let out a reluctant smile that he hoped that she wouldn't see. Giving her a few seconds he just had time to see her walking into the living room throwing off the sweatshirt as she walked giving him a brief view of her bareback. Tossing these thoughts to the side he started walking towards the kitchen to clean up when he saw her poke her head into the hallway.  
真嗣露出了一个不情愿的微笑，希望她没看到。他给了她几秒钟时间，正好看到她走进客厅，边走边脱掉运动衫，让他瞥见了她的裸背。他把这些念头抛到一边，开始走向厨房准备清理，这时看到她探头进了走廊。

"Are you coming or what?"  
“你来不来？”

Shinji's face showed total confusion as he looked back at her. Asuka sighed in an annoyed sort of way and jerked her finger towards the living room.  
真嗣的脸上满是困惑，他回头看着她。明日香带着一种恼怒的语气叹了口气，用手指向客厅。

"I'm telling you to get over here. I don't care whether you watch what I'm watching or read a book, but I'm giving you the day off so forget about the dishes. Misato can clean then for once."  
“我叫你过来。我不在乎你是看我看的节目还是看书，但今天我给你放假，别管洗碗了。让美里自己打扫一次吧。”

Did Shinji hear that right? Did Asuka want to spend time with him actually?  
真嗣听对了吗？明日香真的想和他一起度过时间吗？

"Uh sure..." “呃，当然...”

As Shinji walked hesitantly into the living room he had to refrain from quickly peeking in. Most of the time when Shinji or Asuka were alone by themselves at home Asuka forbade Shinji from stepping into the living room. So he usually spent most of his time in his bedroom listening to his SDAT.  
当真嗣犹豫地走进客厅时，他不得不克制自己迅速偷看的冲动。大多数时候，当真嗣或明日香独自在家时，明日香禁止真嗣进入客厅。所以他通常大部分时间都待在自己的卧室里听他的 SDAT。

Asuka was sprawled on her back on the couch with her head tilted up looking at the T.V. She must have heard Shinji cause she sat up briefly and pointed to a spot on the floor. Shinji nodded and ran into his room to grab a book. While she was watching something that wasn't German it was still a Japanese soap opera.  
明日香仰面躺在沙发上，头向后仰看着电视。她一定是听到了真嗣的声音，因为她短暂地坐了起来，指着地板上的一个位置。真嗣点点头，跑回房间拿了一本书。尽管她看的不是德语节目，但仍然是一部日本肥皂剧。

Even though they were in the same room together, any forms of conversation was dropped dead when they were started. Neither were really sure what to say to the other as they were usually glaring at each other. Several times Shinji tried to ask her something but she either waved him off because it was an important part in her T.V. show or she frowned at him and ignored his question. Shinji was starting to wonder why he had even agreed to be in the living room with her.  
尽管他们同处一室，任何形式的对话一旦开始便戛然而止。两人都不确定该对对方说些什么，因为他们通常只是互相瞪眼。有好几次，真嗣试图向她提问，但她要么因为电视节目中的重要部分挥手让他走开，要么就皱着眉头无视他的问题。真嗣开始怀疑自己为何要同意和她一起待在客厅里。

Shinji was just starting to think of getting up when a question that he would never thought of normally hit his brain.  
真嗣正想着起身离开，一个他平时绝不会想到的问题突然闪过脑海。

"Um Asuka?" “呃，明日香？”

"Hmmm?" She was to fixated on her program to reply.  
"嗯？" 她过于专注于她的程序，以至于没有回应。

"What are your parents like?"  
"你的父母是什么样的人？"

Shinji could tell that it wasn't something she didn't enjoyed talking about as her entire body seemed to seize up. Attempting to fix what he just uttered he said, "I-I'm sorry. If you don't want to talk about it, its fine."  
真嗣可以看出这不是她喜欢谈论的话题，因为她的整个身体似乎都僵住了。试图弥补他刚才说的话，他说道："我……我很抱歉。如果你不想谈这个，没关系。"

Asuka slowly turned her head towards him and frowned at him. It wasn't one of her usually frowns which showed annoyance, it was more curious.  
明日香缓缓转头看向他，皱起了眉头。这不是她通常那种表示不悦的皱眉，而是带着更多的好奇。

"Why do you want to know?" She asked slowly.  
“你为什么想知道？”她缓缓问道。

Shinji hesitated, "I don't know...I've never really known what a family is like. I told you that my father moved me around from place to place, right."  
真嗣犹豫了一下，“我不知道……我从来没真正了解过家庭是什么样的。我告诉过你，我父亲总是把我从一个地方搬到另一个地方，对吧。”

Asuka thought about it for a minute and remembered what Shinji had told her after he pilot Unit 01 for the first time. She nodded.  
明日香想了一会儿，记起真嗣第一次驾驶初号机后告诉她的话。她点了点头。

"I don't have any idea what a family is like because my mother died when I was young. I don't even know what she looked like. I've never been shown pictures of her and my father doesn't seem to care. I was just told that she died in a lab accident. Misato is more of a mother than anyone I've ever known, though I suppose she can double as a father also, with all the beer she drinks."  
“我对家庭一无所知，因为我母亲在我很小的时候就去世了。我甚至不记得她的样子。从未有人给我看过她的照片，而父亲似乎也不在乎。我只被告知她死于实验室事故。美里比起我所认识的任何人更像一个母亲，尽管我想她也能兼任父亲的角色，毕竟她喝那么多啤酒。”

Asuka had to repress a smile at Shinji's words, though he noticed it anyway.  
听到真嗣的话，明日香不得不忍住笑意，尽管他还是注意到了。

"So I guess what I'm saying is I just want to know what a real family is like."  
“所以我猜我想说的是，我只是想知道一个真正的家庭是什么样的。”

There, back to the subject of her family. It was a subject that Asuka hated to discuss and had long since buried painful memories. Turning off the T.V. that she no longer had an urge to watch she looked back at Shinji and said, "I'd rather not talk about it."  
说到她的家庭，这是一个她讨厌讨论的话题，早已埋藏了痛苦的记忆。她关掉了不再想看的电视，回头看着真嗣说：“我不想谈这个。”

Shinji had expected this when he saw that she seemed to seize up, but was curious anyway.  
真嗣看到她似乎僵住了，就预料到了这一点，但仍然感到好奇。

"Thats okay, if you don't want to talk about it I can understand that."  
"没关系，如果你不想谈这件事，我能理解。"

"So you're mother is dead, and you consider Misato to be your mother."  
"所以你妈妈去世了，而你把美里当成妈妈。"

Shrugging Shinji said, "Compared to all the other roommates that I've ever known she is the most caring out of all them. Though that doesn't mean much as almost all of my other roommates were either partying or drunk."  
真嗣耸了耸肩说：“与其他我认识的室友相比，她是最关心人的一个。不过这也不算什么，因为我之前的室友几乎不是在聚会就是在醉酒。”

"So then what do you consider me as..."  
"那么你把我当成什么呢..."

Shinji was caught of guard for a moment and was unsure what to say. He had said that he considered Asuka a friend, the first that he had ever had. But fights between them seemed to break out continuously and it was hard to get along with somebody who seemed ready to kick you in the balls at any second.  
真嗣一时措手不及，不知该如何回答。他曾说过把明日香视为朋友，这是他人生中的第一位朋友。但两人之间似乎总是争吵不断，与一个随时可能踢你一脚的人相处实在不易。

Shrugging Shinji said, "I honestly don't know anymore."  
真嗣耸了耸肩，说道：“老实说，我现在真的不知道了。”

Asuka frowned, "And what is that supposed to mean?"  
明日香皱眉，“那是什么意思？”

"I told you that I considered you a friend, the first one I ever made."  
“我告诉过你，我把你视为朋友，是我第一个真正交到的朋友。”

"Yeah..." "是啊..."

"We fight so much that I don't know if we even are friends anymore."  
“我们争吵不断，我都不知道我们是否还算朋友了。”

Asuka looked at Shinji for a minute, confused at what he ment. "What do you mean?"  
明日香看着真嗣，困惑于他的意思。“你是什么意思？”

"Why are you always picking on me and calling me stupid!" Shinji blurted out. "Why do you always seem to put me down! Have you once cared about how I feel, no! Its all about you, its always been about you."  
“为什么你总是针对我，叫我笨蛋！”真嗣脱口而出。“为什么你总是贬低我！你有没有一次关心过我的感受，没有！一切都是关于你，一直都是关于你。”

Asuka was silent as Shinji let out all of his frustration about her attitude towards him. She didn't know what to say. It was just how she was. She had never worried about other people's feeling because nobody seemed to care about what she felt. Her own-  
真嗣将他对明日香态度的所有不满发泄出来，明日香沉默不语。她不知道该说什么。她就是这样的人。她从未担心过别人的感受，因为似乎没有人关心她的感受。她自己的——

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

"What!" He snapped back. "什么！" 他厉声回应道。

"I'd rather not argue with you right now."  
"我现在不想和你争论。"

"Who's arguing!" "谁在争辩！"

"Just shut it...please..."  
"只是闭嘴...请..."

It was the please more than anything that calmed Shinji down. He could never remember hearing her voice as soft as this, or the words please coming out of her mouth.  
正是这个“请”字，比什么都更能安抚真嗣。他从未记得她的声音如此柔和，或是从她口中听到“请”这个字。

Sitting up, he was about to return to his room as he knew that an outburst from the two of them was soon to follow but he was surprised when her words stopped him.  
他坐起身来，正准备回到自己的房间，因为他知道那两人很快就会爆发争吵，但她的言语却让他意外地停下了脚步。

"Wait, Shinji..." “等等，真嗣……”

Shinji looked over his shoulder to see Asuka sitting up with a meek expression on her face. "What," he said, but it was much calmer.  
真嗣回头一看，只见明日香坐起身来，脸上带着温顺的表情。“怎么了？”他问道，语气比平时平静许多。

Asuka leaned back into the couch cushions and bit her lip. "I-I...I'm sorry damn it."  
明日香向后靠在沙发垫上，咬了咬嘴唇。“我……我……该死，对不起。”

Shinji raised an eyebrow. "You...sorry?"  
真嗣挑了挑眉。“你……道歉？”

"Yes, is that so weird?"  
“是的，这很奇怪吗？”

"Actually yes, I've never heard you say you were sorry for anything."  
"实际上是的，我从没听你说过你为任何事感到抱歉。"

"Well, now you have." "好吧，现在你听到了。"

"And?" "然后呢？"

"And what!" “那又怎样！”

"What is that supposed to do? Your sorry, cool. Not like you can reverse everything that you've ever said or did to me."  
“那能有什么用？你道歉了，很好。但不像你能收回你对我说的或做的一切。”

Asuka had never received verbal abuse anywhere near close to what Shinji was dishing and felt like she was close to tears.  
绫波从未遭受过如此接近真嗣所施加的言语伤害，她感到自己快要哭了。

"Damn it Shinji, what do you want me to do!"  
"该死的真嗣，你到底想让我做什么！"

Shrugging he said, "I don't know. I really don't anymore."  
他耸耸肩说：“我不知道。我真的不知道了。”

"Tell me then ass-hole!" “那就告诉我，混蛋！”

"This is exactly what I mean. You give no regard to what other peoples feelings are."  
“这正是我的意思。你丝毫不顾及别人的感受。”

Asuka was slightly abashed but retorted back. "How do you even know what other people's emotion are? You've never had a friend in your life!"  
明日香略感尴尬，随即反驳道：“你怎么可能知道别人的情绪？你这辈子连个朋友都没有！”

Asuka flinched then as Shinji took several quick steps over to her and was fearful that he was about to hit her, or worse. Instead Shinji glared down at her and said, "I may not have many friends but I understand people a lot better than you."  
明日香一惊，只见真嗣快步走向她，她害怕他可能会打她，甚至更糟。然而，真嗣只是瞪着她，说道：“我或许朋友不多，但我比你更懂得人心。”

Shinji realized that he had gone to far then as Asuka looked tearfully back up at him. All the anger seemed to drain out of Shinji as he took a few steps back and sank to the floor. Asuka meanwhile laid back down on the couch and turned her body so that she was facing the couch.  
真嗣意识到自己做得太过分了，因为明日香泪眼汪汪地抬头看着他。所有的怒气似乎都从真嗣身上消失了，他后退了几步，瘫坐在地板上。与此同时，明日香又躺回了沙发上，转身背对着沙发。

After several minutes Shinji broke the silence by saying, "Sorry what I just said, it was rude." She responded by hiccuping slightly.  
几分钟后，真嗣打破了沉默，说道：“对不起，我刚才说的那些话，太粗鲁了。”她回应时微微打了个嗝。

After several painful moments of deciding whether to continue the conversation, Shinji was about to stand up when he saw that Asuka had beat him to it. Whether she had cried silent tears or whether she had already used them all up he wasn't sure, as her face was dry and looking at him. Seconds later Asuka motioned for him to sit next to her. Shinji twitched at this gesture. He wanted to repair what had already transpired, but wasn't sure if it would even matter.  
在经过几个痛苦的瞬间决定是否继续对话后，真嗣正要站起来，却发现明日香已经抢先一步。他不确定她是默默流泪还是已经流干了眼泪，因为她的脸是干的，正看着他。几秒钟后，明日香示意他坐在她旁边。真嗣对这个动作有些紧张。他想要修复已经发生的事情，但不确定这样做是否还有意义。

"Are you sure." Shinji asked hesitantly.  
“你确定吗？” 真嗣犹豫地问道。

Asuka nodded but it was her eyes that Shinji was watching. They showed sincerity and Shinji excepted that.  
明日香点了点头，但真嗣关注的是她的眼睛。它们流露出真诚，真嗣接受了这一点。

Sitting down silently next to Asuka he glanced at her and saw that her eyes were staring at the ground. 'Give her as much time as she needs,' Shinji told himself.  
默默地坐在明日香旁边，他瞥了她一眼，发现她的目光凝视着地面。‘给她足够的时间，’ 真嗣对自己说。

After what seemed an eternity Asuka slowly opened her mouth. "I don't know why I always put you down, I really don't. But-" She paused unsure if she should go on. It was still painful. But he shared and now it was her turn.  
仿佛过了一个世纪，明日香缓缓张开了嘴。“我不知道为什么我总是贬低你，我真的不知道。但是——”她停顿了一下，不确定是否应该继续。那仍然很痛苦。但他分享了，现在轮到她了。

"You could compare our childhoods and see similarities."  
“你可以比较我们的童年，看看相似之处。”

Shinji was startled to no end and gaped confusedly back at her. "What!"  
真嗣惊得目瞪口呆，困惑地回望着她。“什么！”

"I said that from the sound of it we both had troubling childhood!"  
"我说听起来我们俩的童年都不太愉快！"

"You don't have to yell."  
"你不用这么大声。"

"...Sorry." "...抱歉。"

"Its fine." “没事的。”

Asuka nodded and continued. "My mother like yours died early, she worked at Nerv. I remember her though, slightly. I get my hair from her. My father though...he remarried and we were happy for a while. But then...he caught my stepmother sleeping with another man, and she left him for him."  
明日香点点头，继续说道：“我母亲和你母亲一样，很早就去世了，她在 NERV 工作。我虽然对她有些模糊的记忆，但我知道我的头发是遗传自她。至于我父亲……他再婚了，我们曾一度过得很幸福。但后来……他发现继母和另一个男人有染，她就为了那个男人离开了他。”

Shinji was silent but a creese was steadily started to form on his forehead.  
真嗣沉默不语，但他的额头上逐渐皱起了一道纹。

"My father sort of lost it after that...he started drinking heavily. I'd come home some nights and he'd be completely drunk, smelling of booze. Sometimes he'd confuse me for his first wife, my mother, and attack me in a drunken rage. By then I'd starting learning stuff on my own...I think I was six or seven at the time...he rarely remembered my birthdays."  
那之后，我父亲有点崩溃了……他开始酗酒。有些晚上我回家，他会完全醉倒，满身酒气。有时他会把我错当成他的第一任妻子，也就是我的母亲，然后在酒醉中对我发狂。那时我开始自学一些东西……我想我当时六七岁……他很少记得我的生日。

Shinji's frown was now very noticeable and his knuckles were starting to turn white. He also noticed that Asuka's voice was starting to get softer and softer."  
真嗣的眉头现在非常明显，他的指节开始变白。他还注意到明日香的声音开始变得越来越轻。

She continued. "My father slept with so many different women over those three years that I can't count the times that he kept me up at night, with his fucking around." It was the first time that her voice showed a hatred that Shinji had not yet seen. It was something that he had never experienced.  
她继续说道：“那三年里，我父亲和那么多不同的女人睡过，我数不清有多少次他让我彻夜难眠，就因为他那些该死的勾当。”这是她第一次表现出真嗣未曾见过的恨意。这是他从未经历过的情感。

"Several times he'd beat me when he got home, either after a long night of drinking, or after being dumped by another woman. I called 911 several times but each time they showed up he brushed it off as a minor attitude adjustment, saying that I had just had a temper tantrum and that it was all resolved. I don't think I've had a temper tantrum since I was five years old."  
有好几次，他回家后都会打我，要么是酗酒一夜之后，要么是被另一个女人甩了之后。我多次拨打 911，但每次警察来时，他都轻描淡写地说这只是小打小闹，说我只是发了脾气，事情已经解决了。我不记得自己五岁以后还发过脾气。

"I remember I took a test...on my own, my IQ was high enough for it. I had saved up enough money to pay for it. It was to get into a college in Germany. I studied like crazy and starting to distance myself from my so called father. He realized this but ignored it, saying that I'd turn into a slut like all the other woman that he'd ever met."  
我记得我参加了一个测试……靠自己的能力，我的智商足够高。我攒够了钱来支付费用。这是为了进入德国的一所大学。我疯狂学习，开始疏远我所谓的父亲。他意识到了这一点，但置之不理，说我也会变成像他遇到过的所有女人那样的荡妇。

Shinji's face was obviously showing rage but he tried to downplay it. Asuka paused here and took a deep and Shinji saw that she hesitated.  
真嗣的脸上明显带着愤怒，但他试图掩饰。明日香在这里停顿了一下，深吸一口气，真嗣注意到她犹豫了。

"Its okay if you don't want to continue."  
"如果你不想继续也没关系。"

Asuka shook her head, "I've buried this for so long. I'm rather glad to get it off my chest."  
明日香摇了摇头，"我埋藏这件事太久了。我很高兴能把它说出来。"

"You sure?" "你确定吗？"

Asuka nodded, and continued. "I had just turned ten, and was excited to get into the college, and get away from my father. He came back one night though, heavily drunk." Asuka's voice broke here and she started to shake uncontrollably. Shinji had never been in a situation like this before and wasn't sure how he should react.  
"明日香点点头，继续说道：“那时我刚满十岁，满心期待着进入大学，逃离父亲。但有一天晚上，他醉醺醺地回来了。”明日香的声音在这里哽咽了，她开始无法控制地颤抖。真嗣从未遇到过这种情况，不确定自己该如何反应。”

"M-My father attacked me in a drunken rage...he...he mistook me for my mother. For awhile...he had stopped abusing me...because I had called the police so...much that they were suspicious. He didn't...gi..give me a chance to get to the phone." Asuka then put both hands up to her face and mumbled, "He tried...t-to...ra-rape me."  
"“我父亲在酒醉中对我发起了攻击……他……他把我错当成了我母亲。有一段时间……他停止了对我的虐待……因为我多次报警……他们开始怀疑了。他没……给我机会去打电话。”明日香随后双手捂住脸，喃喃道，“他试图……对我……施暴。””

If Shinji had been clenching something it would have shattered. Boiling hatred the likes of which he never new surfaced. His hatred of his own father couldn't even compare to what he felt like doing to this bastard.  
"如果真嗣手里握着什么东西，那一定会被他捏碎。他从未感受过如此沸腾的仇恨。他对亲生父亲的恨意与之相比简直微不足道，他此刻只想对这个混蛋施以同样的报复。”

Asuka meanwhile had her faced buried in her hands and was crying silently. She had always built up a strong front, that she was invulnerable to anything. This though was something that she had always buried deep. Nobody knew about this except for the psychiatrist that she met frequently after her father had tried to rape her. Now Shinji knew.  
与此同时，明日香将脸埋在双手中，默默地哭泣。她总是筑起一道坚强的防线，仿佛无坚不摧。然而，这是她一直深藏心底的秘密。除了她父亲试图强奸她后频繁见面的心理医生，没有人知道这件事。现在，真嗣知道了。

Shinji looked helplessly back at Asuka who was still crying silently. What should he do? Ignore what she said and act as though it was in the past and everything was okay. Maybe if he was the Shinji from several weeks ago he would have. Now was different.  
真嗣无助地回头看向仍在默默哭泣的明日香。他该怎么办？无视她的话，假装一切都已过去，一切都没事了。或许如果是几周前的他，他会这么做。但现在不同了。

Without even hesitating he leaned his arm behind Asuka's back, which was easy as she was leaning forward with her face buried in her hands. At first he thought about patting her on the back, reassuring her that everything was okay. Instead though he decided to bring her into a comforting hug. Though it appeared that he didn't have to take the initiative as Asuka leaned into it as though waiting for his touch.  
他毫不犹豫地伸出胳膊，绕到明日香的背后，这很容易，因为她正向前倾，脸埋在双手中。起初，他想过轻拍她的背，安慰她一切都会好起来。然而，他决定给她一个安慰的拥抱。虽然看起来他不必主动，因为明日香似乎一直在等待他的触碰，自然而然地靠了过来。

Soon Shinji had his hands wrapped around Asuka's middle as she cried silently into his shoulder. "Its okay," he mumbled. She seemed glad that somebody was just there for her.  
"很快，真嗣的双手环绕在明日香腰间，她默默地靠在他的肩上哭泣。“没事的，”他喃喃道。她似乎很高兴有人在她身边。”

After several odd minutes for Shinji, Asuka pulled back as though realizing what she was doing. "Sorry you had to see that."  
"对真嗣来说，这几分钟显得格外漫长，明日香突然退开，仿佛意识到自己在做什么。“抱歉让你看到这一幕。””

"Don't feel bad about it. Nobody should have to carry something like that. Makes my sufferings seem like a joke."  
“别为此感到难过。没人应该背负这样的重担。相比之下，我的痛苦简直像个笑话。”

Asuka let out a small hiccup and put a hand to her mouth as though embarrassed by showing this much emotion. "You wont tell anyone, will you."  
明日香发出一声小小的呃逆，用手捂住嘴，似乎因流露出如此多的情感而感到尴尬。“你不会告诉任何人吧，会吗？”

Shinji shook his head, "I don't even want to think about it. I'm so mad I'd kill him if I saw him right now."  
真嗣摇了摇头，“我甚至不想去想这件事。我现在气得要是见到他，真想杀了他。”

"You'd have to beat me to it."  
“你得先过我这关。”

It felt weird that they could talk about something this disturbing so calmly. But Shinji knew otherwise, he knew that Asuka was hurting.  
他们能如此平静地讨论这样令人不安的事情，感觉很奇怪。但真嗣知道实情，他知道明日香正在受伤。

"We should probably get to bed," Shinji finally said.  
“我们或许该去睡觉了，”真嗣终于说道。

Asuka nodded her consent and sat up quickly as though determined that she was first to get to her room first. Shinji however caught her wrist, worried about her.  
明日香点头同意，迅速坐起身来，仿佛决心要第一个回到自己的房间。然而，真嗣抓住了她的手腕，担心着她。

"You're okay right?" “你没事吧？”

Asuka seemed to revert back to her normal self slightly as she said to Shinji, "What, thinking that I'll need somebody to sleep next to tonight?"  
明日香似乎稍微恢复了平时的样子，对真嗣说：“怎么，以为我今晚需要人陪睡吗？”

Shinji could have laughed, glad that she seemed to be back to her usual teasing self. Playing along he said, "Only if you want me to."  
真嗣差点笑出声来，很高兴她似乎又回到了平时爱捉弄人的状态。他顺着她的话说：“只要你愿意。”

"Get real. The day I let you sleep with me is the day Third Impact is initiated."  
"别做梦了。我让你上我的床的那天，就是第三次冲击启动的日子。"

"You better hope that never happens then."  
"那你最好祈祷那一天永远不会到来。"

Asuka's face turned pink slightly as she just realized the very real possibility of that happening. Marching back to her door she slid it open and slammed it closed with her foot.  
明日香的脸微微泛红，她刚刚意识到这种可能性确实存在。她快步走回自己的门前，拉开滑门，用脚砰地一声关上。

Shinji sighed at the obvious revert to her usual self. Though he hoped that things would have improved between them. Walking back to his room he opened the door and sat down on his futon, looking up at the ceiling. If only he knew that Asuka was doing the same thing.  
真嗣对着她明显恢复常态的样子叹了口气。尽管他希望他们之间的关系会有所改善。他走回自己的房间，打开门，坐在被褥上，抬头望着天花板。如果他知道明日香也在做同样的事情就好了。

Breakfast the next morning was subdued from the moment the two entered the kitchen. Misato realized that something must have happened last night between the two, because every time they looked at each other they quickly turned away.  
第二天早上的早餐从两人进入厨房的那一刻起就显得沉闷。美里意识到昨晚他们之间一定发生了什么，因为他们每次对视后都迅速移开目光。

"Well, I'm off to work, then. See you two later."  
“那么，我去上班了。再见，你们俩。”

Asuka and Shinji didn't even say anything, or nod for that matter. Shinji didn't want to bring up last night, or rather he wouldn't if Asuka didn't want him to. He really couldn't blame her.  
明日香和真嗣连一句话都没说，甚至连点头示意都没有。真嗣不想提起昨晚的事，或者说，如果明日香不想让他提，他就不会提。他真的不能怪她。

After a few minutes of silence Shinji said, "Lets get ready for school, I'll start making lunch."  
沉默了几分钟后，真嗣说道：“我们准备上学吧，我来开始做午饭。”

Asuka nodded and slid off her chair and slowly walked to her room to take a shower and change. Shinji sighed when she was no longer in view. Really he preferred the annoying, slightly bitchy Asuka to the one that he had to walk to school with.  
明日香点点头，从椅子上滑下来，慢慢走向她的房间去洗澡和换衣服。真嗣在她看不见之后叹了口气。说实话，他更喜欢那个有点烦人、有点泼辣的明日香，而不是现在这个和他一起走到学校的她。

After making their lunches Shinji waited for a while for Asuka to come out of her room fully dressed. However when he didn't even hear the sound of the shower running he walked over to her door and said quietly, "You ready?"  
做完午餐后，真嗣等了一会儿，希望明日香能穿好衣服从房间里出来。然而，当他连淋浴的声音都没听到时，他走到她的门前，轻声问道：“准备好了吗？”

What came back was her usual tone, "Leave me alone, baka."  
回应他的是她一贯的语气，“别烦我，笨蛋。”

Shinji sighed and leaned his back against the wall opposite her door. After a moments pause he said, "If you don't want to go to school just say so."  
真嗣叹了口气，背靠在她门对面的墙上。片刻停顿后，他说道：“如果你不想去学校，直说就好。”

Shinji thought he heard an intake of breath and then the release of the breath. "Fine..."  
真嗣以为他听到了一声吸气，随后是呼气声。“好吧……”

"I'll get the work that you'll miss."  
“我会完成你错过的那些工作。”

"Whatever." “随便。”

Shinji thought about opening the door to her room but was afraid that she might throw something at him. So he grabbed his lunch off the counter, turned around and whispered a small, "See you later," before walking out the door.  
真嗣考虑过打开她房间的门，但又害怕她会朝他扔东西。于是他拿起柜台上的午餐，转过身，轻声说了句“再见”，然后走出了门。

Asuka meanwhile had her face buried in her pillow, trying to forget about her past.  
与此同时，明日香把脸埋在枕头里，试图忘记她的过去。

School seemed rougher for some reason without Asuka with him. Maybe it was the fact that half the school seemed to think that they were going out and Asuka would kill them if they said anything bad to Shinji. So Shinji was battered with questions repeatedly about where Asuka was. At one point somebody asked where his bitch was, referring to Asuka. Shinji had almost smashed the guy's head on the sink fountain, but Kensuke pulled him away before he had a chance to.  
不知为何，没有明日香在身边，学校的生活似乎更加艰难。也许是因为学校里有一半人认为他们在交往，而明日香会杀了那些对真嗣说坏话的人。因此，真嗣不断被问及明日香在哪里。有一次，有人问他的婊子在哪里，指的是明日香。真嗣差点把那家伙的头撞到水池上，但健介及时把他拉开了。

So Shinji stormed up the stairs to the top of the school were he usually went for seclusion and was very annoyed that Kensuke was following him with a rather reluctant Touji behind him.  
于是真嗣气冲冲地跑上楼梯，来到学校顶楼，那是他常去寻求独处的地方，却非常恼火看到健介跟在他后面，而圭介则有些不情愿地跟在健介后面。

"Shinji what the fuck was that all about?" Kensuke rarely swore unless something was really bothering him.  
“真嗣，那他妈的到底是怎么回事？”健介很少骂人，除非真的有什么事让他很烦心。

"Shut it Kensuke!" “闭嘴，健介！”

"Ah did you two get in a fight," smirked Touji.  
“啊，你们俩吵架了？” 东治带着一丝嘲笑问道。

Shinji rounded on him, grabbed him by the front of his shirt and yelled, "SHUT THE FUCK UP!" These bastards couldn't understand the torment that Asuka was dealing with right now.  
真嗣转身面对他，抓住他的衬衫前襟大喊：“闭嘴！”这些混蛋根本不懂明日香现在正在经历的痛苦。

Touji seemed rather startled and took a few steps backwards as soon as Shinji let go of him. Shinji was a lot stronger then he had given him credit for.  
东治显得相当惊讶，一被真嗣放开就后退了几步。真嗣比他之前认为的要强得多。

"Damn, don't have to flip out over a stupid comment," said Touji.  
"该死，没必要因为一句蠢话就发飙吧，" 东治说道。

"You have no idea what your talking about so just shut the fuck up!"  
"你根本不知道自己在说什么，所以就他妈的闭嘴吧！"

"Ah, did you get her pregnant and now you've got to man-up because of it."  
"啊，你是不是把她搞怀孕了，现在得像个男人一样承担责任了。"

Shinji probably would have cracked Touji's skull open then if Rei didn't come walking onto the scene. To any normal person who saw what was going they would have ran to the nearest teacher and got the fight broken up. Rei however gave no noticed that Shinji was just about to kill someone and said calmly, "Shinji the principal wants to see us."  
如果不是绫波零恰巧走进现场，真嗣可能当时就真的把冬二的头骨打裂了。换作任何一个普通人看到这一幕，都会立刻跑去找最近的老师来制止这场斗殴。然而，绫波却似乎没注意到真嗣差点杀了人，只是平静地说道：“真嗣，校长要见我们。”

Shinji's face relaxed slightly as he looked back at her. "Both of us?"  
真嗣回头看向她，脸上的表情稍微缓和了一些。“我们两个都要去吗？”

Rei nodded silently, turned, and walked back down the flight of stairs.  
绫波默默地点了点头，转身走下了楼梯。

Shinji waited a few seconds, still deciding whether he should smash Touji's head in. After deciding the last thing he needed right now was expulsion, he gave both of them a disgusting look, and followed Rei at a brisk pace down the stairs.  
真嗣等了几秒钟，仍在犹豫是否应该砸烂冬二的脑袋。在决定眼下最不需要的就是被开除后，他给了他们一个厌恶的眼神，然后快步跟上绫波，走下楼梯。

After a hasty discussion with the principle, in which Shinji had learned that Misato had called the school when Asuka didn't answer hers, the two learned that an angel had appeared off the coast of China and had reduced the defense there to rubble.  
在与校长匆忙讨论后，真嗣得知美里在明日香没有接电话时联系了学校，两人得知一个使徒出现在中国沿海，并将那里的防御设施化为废墟。

Now the two of them were racing along in a Nerv jeep that had picked them up moments before. Shinji was tempted to run home really quick and grab Asuka, but decide that she didn't need a life or death battle right now.  
此刻，他们正乘坐一辆 NERV 的吉普车疾驰，这辆车在片刻前接上了他们。真嗣本想迅速跑回家带上明日香，但转念一想，她现在并不需要经历一场生死之战。

The entrance to the Geofront may have been ten miles away from school but the driver made in there in seven minutes. Shinji rolled out of the car and for once wishing that Misato had been driving. Rei jumped out of the jeep quite effortlessly and started trotting slightly towards the command center.  
虽然前往地底都市的入口离学校有十英里远，但司机仅用七分钟就到达了。真嗣从车里滚了出来，这次他竟然希望是美里在开车。绫波轻松地跳下吉普车，开始小跑着向指挥中心前进。

Misato greeted them and the gave them a few minor details. The angel seemed to be able detect when a hostile enemy approached and responded directly to that attack obliterating it in an instance. China apparently had discovered a weakness in its attack pattern though. A small window of three seconds appeared during which it wasn't able to use its positron particle beam. They were supposed to be aiming for that narrow window. Unit 00 would attack the target while Unit 01 would use a positron rifle to shoot it straight through the middle where the core was expected to be. Asuka was supposed to provide back up for Rei if anything happened but things had changed and Shinji was now pulled aside as Misato asked about Asuka.  
美里迎接了他们，并提供了一些细节。天使似乎能探测到敌意接近并直接回应攻击，瞬间将其消灭。不过，中国显然发现了其攻击模式中的一个弱点。在三秒钟的短暂窗口期内，它无法使用阳电子粒子束。他们应该瞄准这个狭窄的窗口。零号机将攻击目标，而初号机则使用阳电子步枪直接射击预计的核心位置。原本应该是明日香为绫波提供支援，但情况有变，真嗣被拉到一旁，美里询问关于明日香的事情。

"How come Asuka wasn't at school?"  
“为什么明日香不在学校？”

Shinji had just changed into his plug suit and was still trying to get used to the feeling of the fabric. Without averted his eyes from Misato he said, "She said she was sick, didn't feel well."  
真嗣刚刚换上他的插入栓服，还在努力适应布料的感觉。他没有将视线从美里身上移开，说道：“她说她生病了，感觉不太好。”

Misato frowned, "But why didn't you pick her up on the way here? Rei's job becomes much for dangerous without the backup from Asuka."  
美里皱起眉头，“但你为什么不在来的路上接她呢？没有明日香的支援，丽的工作会危险得多。”

Shrugging Shinji said, "I didn't think she'd be able to concentrate properly."  
真嗣耸了耸肩说：“我觉得她可能无法集中注意力。”

Misato frowned, "While I'm glad that you're worried about her, concentration isn't affected by temporary things like that."  
美里皱了皱眉，“虽然我很高兴你担心她，但专注力不会被那种短暂的事情影响。”

"I'll keep that in mind next time."  
“下次我会记住的。”

Shinji passed Misato without another word, while Misato was slightly surprised. Did she and Shinji just have there first argument?  
真嗣没再多说一句话就从美里身边走过，美里有些惊讶。难道她和真嗣刚刚第一次吵架了？

Soon Shinji was sent up elevator number five which would take him directly to the positron rifle. The angel, dubbed Ramiel, was hovering directly above Tokyo-3 as though waiting for something.  
很快，真嗣被送上了五号电梯，这将直接带他到达阳电子步枪处。被命名为雷米尔的天使正悬浮在第三新东京市上空，仿佛在等待着什么。

Shinji quickly adjusted the positron rifle and aimed his sights down at the target. "Misato I've got the angel in my sights."  
真嗣迅速调整了阳电子步枪，将瞄准镜对准目标。“美里，我已经锁定天使了。”

Misato didn't answer him at first but instead checked a monitor on the screen. It showed that Shinji's sync rate was currently holding steady at fifty-nine.  
美里起初没有回答他，而是检查了屏幕上的一个监视器。显示真嗣的同步率目前稳定在五十九。

'Well, he's improved so I suppose that I won't reprimand him for his attitude earlier,' thought Misato.  
'嗯，他进步了不少，我想我不会因为他早先的态度而责备他了，'Misato 心想。

Turning back towards the monitor she said, "Okay Shinji. We've got one shot at this before we have to recharge the rifle, so make it count."  
她转回监控器前，说道：“好了，真嗣。我们只有一次机会，之后就得给枪充电，所以务必命中。”

Shinji nodded and disengaged the radio from Misato. He needed to focus solely on hitting his target. Almost immediately thoughts of Asuka rushed through his head as he wondered how she was cooping back home. He was quick to push these thoughts aside though as he saw Rei take action.  
真嗣点点头，断开了与 Misato 的无线电联系。他需要全神贯注地击中目标。几乎立刻，关于明日香的思绪涌入脑海，他好奇她在家里是如何应对的。但他很快把这些念头抛开，因为看到绫波采取了行动。

Unit 00 dashed down the slope at break neck speed and charged head on at the angel. Sensing danger the angel quickly sent out a particle beam at Unit 00. Twisting around, Unit 00 jumped out of the way as the mass of energy flew past it, torching the earth behind it.  
零号机以惊人的速度冲下斜坡，直面天使发起冲锋。感受到威胁的天使迅速发射出一束粒子光束。零号机一个扭身，跳跃避开，那团能量擦身而过，将后方的大地烧焦。

Shinji knew that he would have only one chance and that he would have to choose it extremely carefully. He watched as Rei dodged another mass of energy.  
真嗣明白他只有一次机会，必须极其谨慎地选择。他看着绫波再次躲过一团能量。

Unit 00 started jumping from one spot to another, trying to get the angel to shoot at it. However the angel did not sense an immediate threat and paused once more.  
零号机开始从一个地点跳到另一个地点，试图引诱天使射击。然而，天使并未察觉到即刻的威胁，又一次停顿下来。

"I'm detecting high heat sources inside of the angel commander."  
"我检测到天使指挥官内部有高温热源。"

Misato spun around and quickly looked as the angel's heat parameters were put on screen.  
美里迅速转身，目光紧随着天使的热参数被投射到屏幕上。

Misato looked at it for a moment. It seemed as though the angel was building up a large amount energy at the very bottom of its body.  
美里凝视片刻，似乎天使正在其身体底部积蓄大量能量。

"Shit!" "该死！"

Everyone looked around the control room as Misato swore. Biting her nail she glared back at the monitor and thought, 'With that much energy built up, that angel will be able to puncture a hole directly to the Geofront.'  
当美里咒骂时，控制室里的每个人都环顾四周。她咬着指甲，怒视着监视器，心想：'能量积累到这种程度，那个使徒将能够直接穿透到地底都市。'

Grabbing a nearby headset she quickly yelled into it alerting Shinji and Rei, "Rei, Shinji, back off, we've got a problem."  
她抓起旁边的耳机，迅速向真嗣和丽喊道："丽，真嗣，撤退，我们有麻烦了。"

Shinji let out a giant breath as he was just mentally preparing himself to fire. Rei and Unit 00 quickly backed away to where Shinji and Unit 01 were laying down in the grass with the positron rifle.  
真嗣深吸了一口气，正准备开火。绫波和零号机迅速后退到真嗣和初号机所在的地方，他们正躺在草地上，手持阳电子步枪。

"What's wrong Misato?" “怎么了，美里？”

"I have no idea if its a problem or not but the angel is showing strong heat signatures at the lowest point of its body. If enough energy is built up the possibility of it tearing directly through the forty-five layers of steel to the Geofront."  
“我不确定这是否是个问题，但使徒在其身体最低点显示出强烈的热信号。如果能量积累足够，它有可能直接撕裂四十五层钢板，直达地底都市。”

Everyone was silent in the command center. Shinji didn't have enough knowledge of what was inside the Geofront to understand the severity of this.  
指挥中心内一片寂静。真嗣对地下都市的了解不足，无法理解这一情况的严重性。

"I want an estimate of how long we have until enough energy is built up to pierce the layers."  
“我要一个估计，看看我们还有多少时间，直到能量积累到足以穿透地层。”

"Umm judging by the power of an individual positron wave, the computer shows that we have ten minutes to stop the discharge."  
“呃，根据单个阳电子波的威力，电脑显示我们还有十分钟来阻止放电。”

"Shinji is the positron gun still ready."  
"真嗣，阳电子炮准备好了吗？"

"Hai." "嗨。"

"Good, ten minutes is a long time. Get to it. Rei, cover him, if the angel shows any signs of attacking Shinji."  
"很好，十分钟时间很充裕。开始吧。绫波，如果使徒有攻击真嗣的迹象，掩护他。"

"Hai." "嗨。"

Misato then sank down in her chair and let out a low sigh. 'I'm gonna need a long time at the bar to clear this one up.'  
美里随后坐回椅子上，低声叹息道：'看来我得在酒吧里待上好一阵子才能理清这事儿了。'

Shinji quickly readjusted his sights on the angel again and waited patiently for an opening.  
真嗣迅速重新调整瞄准天使的视线，耐心等待着机会。

Unit 00 charged again down the hill towards the angel. This time the angel, sensing danger, split itself into an exact replica. Two blue diamonds were now floating over Tokyo-3. The replica fire off a positron beam directly at Unit 00. Rei managed to roll out of the way as the positron beam flew over her.  
零号机再次冲下山坡，向天使发起冲锋。这次，天使察觉到了危险，分裂成了一个完全相同的复制品。两个蓝色钻石现在悬浮在第三新东京市上空。复制品发射出一道正电子光束，直奔零号机。绫波设法翻滚避开，正电子光束从她上方掠过。

Kicking up dirt as she skidded across the ground, Rei spun around and barely managed to dodge another wave as it almost tore off Unit 00's left arm. Running parallel on the side of a hill Unit 00 jumped in the air and went flying towards the replica of the angel. The replica fired off a positron wave which Rei was forced to roll over to avoid.  
绫波滑行在地面上，扬起尘土，转身时险些躲过另一波攻击，差点撕裂零号机的左臂。沿着山坡侧面并行奔跑，零号机一跃而起，向天使的复制品飞去。复制品发射出一道正电子波，绫波被迫翻滚躲避。

Unit 00 suddenly did a downward dive at the angel. The replica put forth an AT-field as Unit 00 neared it. Copying its enemy, Rei put forth the most power full AT-field that she could muster and ripped a small hole open in the replica's AT-field. Quick as a flash she drew the progressive knife in the shoulder holster of her Eva and threw it straight through the opening. The progressive knife made a deep puncture directly where the positron wave was fired.  
零号机突然向使徒俯冲下去。复制体在零号机接近时展开了 AT 力场。模仿对手，绫波竭尽全力展开了她所能施展的最强 AT 力场，并在复制体的 AT 力场上撕开了一个小洞。她迅速从 Eva 肩部的枪套中抽出高频刀，径直穿过那个缺口投掷过去。高频刀深深刺入了正发射阳电子波的位置。

Suddenly the angel let out an ear splitting shriek that sounded like finger nails on a chalk bored. A white light appeared from inside the replica and soon filled the entire of Tokyo-3 in a blinding white light. Then, it started to fall apart. The white turn to black instantly and the seemed to be falling apart, piece by piece, almost as if it was a puzzle. The replica imploded on itself and showered Tokyo-3 in small droplets of black blood.  
突然，使徒发出了一声刺耳的尖叫，听起来像是用指甲刮擦黑板。一道白光从复制体内部发出，很快整个第三新东京市都被这耀眼的白光笼罩。随后，它开始崩解。白色瞬间转为黑色，仿佛一块块拼图般，一片片地崩落。复制体自我坍缩，将第三新东京市洒满了黑色的血滴。

Shinji's concentration was halted for a second as he watched this all unfold but heard Misato yelling something.  
这一切的发生让真嗣的注意力中断了一瞬，但他听到了美里在喊些什么。

"Six minutes until penetration, and what the hell happened to the angel."  
"还有六分钟就要穿透了，天使到底怎么了。"

Shinji did a double take and looked down the barrel of the positron rifle. She was right! The angel had disappeared, most likely when the replica had imploded and blinded everyone.  
真嗣定睛一看，顺着阳电子步枪的枪管望去。她说得没错！天使不见了，很可能是在复制体坍缩并让所有人失明的时候消失的。

"Kuso! Where is it!" "该死！它去哪儿了！"

Looking wildly around Shinji tried to get a fix on the angel's position.  
真嗣疯狂地环顾四周，试图确定使徒的位置。

"Large heat source directly behind Unit 01, commander," said an operative.  
“指挥官，Unit 01 正后方有大型热源，”一名操作员报告道。

Without even thinking Misato yelled, "Shinji get out of there!"  
米莎毫不犹豫地大喊：“真嗣，快离开那里！”

Shinji didn't even hesitated, and Unit 01 rolled to its left as a particle wave melted the rifle which was their only source of hope. Shinji rolled out of the way as another wave barely missed him. Kicking up off the ground he was greeted by a giant shadow that was hovering directly above him.  
真嗣毫不犹豫，初号机向左翻滚，一道粒子波瞬间融化了他们唯一的希望——那把步枪。真嗣一个翻滚躲开另一道几乎擦身而过的波束。他一脚蹬地跃起，迎面而来的是一个巨大的阴影，正悬停在他正上方。

Shinji had never really experienced true fear until now. Every other time that he had been inside an Eva he had reacted on his emotions, or let the voice fix it for him. This time though, time seemed to freeze itself as he saw the particle wave coming at him in slow motion. Moving didn't even seem to register in his mind until the last moment when it seemed pointless.  
真嗣从未真正体验过此刻的恐惧。以往每次驾驶 EVA 时，他都是凭情绪行事，或是让内心的声音替他解决。但这一次，时间仿佛凝固，他眼看着粒子波以慢动作袭来，移动的念头直到最后一刻才在脑海中闪现，似乎已毫无意义。

Rei appeared directly in front of the angel with a heat shield and blocked the full force of the attack. Deploying her AT-field to the limit she was able to defend Shinji for a certain amount of time.  
绫波丽直接出现在使徒面前，展开热盾挡下了攻击的全部威力。她将 AT 力场发挥到极限，为真嗣争取了一定的时间。

Shinji didn't even move, couldn't for some reason. This selfless act of throwing your life away in the way to protect somebody was chivalrous.  
真嗣甚至没有动弹，不知为何无法动弹。这种无私地牺牲自己生命以保护他人的行为，是骑士精神的体现。

"...Rei..." He didn't expect a response but he got one nonetheless.  
"...绫波..." 他并未期待回应，但仍然得到了回应。

"Ikari...kun." "碇...君。"

Shinji froze, it was the first time that she had said his name. Realizing where he was and how stupid he was be he stood up next to Rei and deployed his own AT-field to the limit. The combination was enough to shatter the angels own AT-field and halt its attack for a moment.  
真嗣愣住了，这是她第一次叫他的名字。意识到自己的处境以及有多愚蠢，他站到绫波身边，将自己的 AT 力场发挥到极限。两者的结合足以粉碎天使的 AT 力场，并暂时阻止了它的攻击。

Turning around the two sprinted down the bank and quickly ducked down behind some buildings. Shinji took a quick look at Unit 00's arms. If he had stopped her in time the arm might be gone. The heat shield was melted to an indistinguishable wad of mental, and the hand that held it was slightly twisted. Shinji couldn't imagine what the temperature inside the entry plug had been.  
两人转身沿着河岸疾跑，迅速躲到一些建筑物后面。真嗣快速看了一眼零号机的手臂。如果他及时阻止了她，那手臂可能已经消失了。热盾被熔成了一团难以辨认的金属块，握着它的手也有些扭曲。真嗣无法想象插入栓内的温度有多高。

"You okay, Rei?" His voice held general concern.  
“你还好吗，绫波？”他的声音中带着普遍的关切。

Silence from her entry plug for a minute in which Shinji started to get worried, then he heard a small voice.  
从她的插入栓里沉默了一分钟，这让真嗣开始感到担忧，随后他听到了一个微弱的声音。

"Yes, I am." “是的，我在。”

"Good. I'm glad." “太好了。我很高兴。”

"You're glad." It wasn't a question, it was a statement.  
"你很高兴。" 这不是一个问句，而是一个陈述。

"Course I'm glad. You're a friend, if something happens to you I'd be worried."  
"当然高兴。你是朋友，如果你出了什么事，我会担心的。"

Rei was silent for a moment and the said, "Friend?"  
丽沉默了一会儿，然后说："朋友？"

"Yeah, you an Asuka are both my friends."  
“是啊，你和明日香都是我的朋友。”

Before either of them could say a word a positron wave tore straight through the building in between them. Rei and Shinji jumped backwards as they saw the angel slowly coming nearer, a faint glow now underneath it.  
在他们能说出一个字之前，一股阳电子波直接穿透了他们之间的建筑物。真嗣和绫波跳向后方，看到天使缓缓靠近，其下方隐约发出微光。

"Damn it, only three minutes left." Shinji looked wildly around for something that might be able to help them...with out much luck. So he did the only thing that he knew that had a chance of working. Concentrating deeply he reached into the very depths of his subconscious. He felt nothing but the LCL fluid around him and inhaled deeply, taking in the smell of blood which he would likely never get used to.  
“该死，只剩三分钟了。”真嗣疯狂地四处寻找可能帮助他们的东西……但运气不佳。于是他做了唯一知道有可能奏效的事。他深吸一口气，集中精神，深入到潜意识的深处。他只感觉到周围的 LCL 液体，深吸一口气，闻到了血腥味，这味道他可能永远都无法习惯。

"Unit 01's sync rate is climbing!"  
"初号机的同步率正在上升！"

Misato stopped biting her nail and looked wildly around. "What!"  
美里停止咬指甲，慌乱地四处张望。“什么！”

"The pilot of Unit 01 is syncing perfectly with Unit 01. Sync rate climbing, sixty-one...no sixty-two...sixty-three."  
"初号机的驾驶员与机体同步率完美匹配。同步率上升，六十一……不，六十二……六十三。"

Misato watched, surprised at Shinji's sudden improvement. 'Is this what happens when he actually tries,' she wondered?  
美里惊讶地看着真嗣突然的进步。'这就是他真正努力时的样子吗？'她暗自思忖。

As Shinji opened his eyes he felt the LCL fluid change. It was comfortable now for him, as though he had always belonged there. The temperature had changed also. It was warm not, like a giant quilt that was tossed over him, and he didn't even seem to taste the blood anymore.  
当真嗣睁开眼睛时，他感觉到 LCL 液体的变化。现在对他来说很舒适，仿佛他一直属于那里。温度也变了，现在温暖如同一床巨大的被子盖在他身上，他甚至不再尝到血液的味道。

"What happened?" “发生了什么？”

"_You finally accepted the Eva and in doing so the Eva has accepted you."_  
"你终于接受了 Eva，而 Eva 也因此接受了你。"

"How come you weren't with me the entire time?"  
"为什么你不是一直陪在我身边？"

"_Sad that I wasn't giving you instruction?"_  
"因为我没有一直在指导你而感到难过吗？"

"Not really. Just that whenever I've had a problem you've taken over."  
"并不是真的。只是每次我有问题时，你总是接手处理。"

"_I wanted you to have to deal with it on your own. You did better than I expected actually."_  
"我希望你能自己解决。实际上，你做得比我想象的还要好。"

"Great, well I need help now!"  
"太好了，现在我需要帮助！"

"_You sure you want to go through with this?"_  
"你确定要这么做吗？"

"Of course, even if I end up in the infirmary again."  
"当然，即使我再次进医务室。"

"_Thats what I like to hear."_  
"我就喜欢你这种精神。"

Shinji was prepared for it this time but it still freaked him out. Nerves from the Eva snaked its way along his skin, piercing into him and connecting with his own nerves. Next he felt like a white, hot poker, pierced into the side of his temples. Droplets of blood leaked from the small holes in his skin and soon blended with the LCL fluid. Strangely the smell of the LCL fluid and his own blood seemed to relax him. Almost as if the two blending together harmonized with him.  
这次真嗣有所准备，但仍感到惊慌。Eva 的神经沿着他的皮肤蜿蜒，刺入他的体内，与他的神经相连。接着，他感觉像是被一根白热的拨火棍刺入太阳穴。血滴从皮肤上的小孔中渗出，很快与 LCL 液体混合。奇怪的是，LCL 液体的气味和他自己的血混合在一起，似乎让他放松了。仿佛这两者融合在一起，与他产生了和谐共鸣。

"_Blood pressure normal. LCL fluid density has been changed. How does it feel?"_  
“血压正常。LCL 液体密度已调整。感觉如何？”

"Right...somehow." “还行……算是吧。”

"_Good, you're getting used to it."_  
"很好，你已经习惯了。"

"I still feel disgusted by it."  
"我还是觉得恶心。"

"_You really should be used to it by now."_  
"你现在真的应该习惯了。"

"Forget it!" "算了吧！"

"..._Fine_." "……好吧。"

Unit 01 shuddered violently as it let out a violent roar, ripping apart the bracers that secured the mouth shut. Arching its back, it got down on all fours and kicked off against the ground, ripping apart the ground as it charged. Shinji felt as though had something had grabbed him behind the collar and jerked him backwards at the sudden change of movement. He wasn't even in control anymore.  
初号机剧烈颤抖着，发出一声狂暴的咆哮，撕裂了固定嘴巴的支架。它弓起背，四肢着地，猛地蹬地向前冲去，地面被撕裂开来。随着突如其来的动作变化，真嗣感觉像是有人抓住了他的后领猛地向后一拽。他甚至已经无法控制自己了。

Jumping through the air, Unit 01 raised both its fists and brought them down on the angels AT-field. Letting out an earsplitting roar it repeated bashed its fists against the AT-field.  
跃入空中，01 号机双拳高举，猛地砸向天使的 AT 力场。伴随着震耳欲聋的咆哮，它不断用拳头猛击 AT 力场。

"_Help me out here. I need you to concentrate."_  
“帮我一把，集中精神。”

"I'm trying, damn it!" “我在努力，该死！”

"_Well try harder."_ “那就再努力些。”

Shinji concentrated harder and felt the LCL fluid change drastically. The controls inside the entry plug disintegrated and changed into LCL fluid. Then Shinji felt a burning sensation start at his feat and creep up to his head. His plug suit was slowly dissolving. Soon Shinji was completely naked and floating inside the entry plug with nothing holding him except the nerves of the Eva.  
真嗣更加集中精神，感觉到 LCL 液体发生了剧烈变化。插入栓内的控制装置分解并转化为 LCL 液体。随后，真嗣感到一种灼热感从脚底开始蔓延至头部。他的驾驶服正在慢慢溶解。不久，真嗣便完全赤裸，仅靠 EVA 的神经悬浮在插入栓内。

Unable to move his body he thought in his mind.  
身体无法动弹，他在心中思索着。

'What is this?' “这是什么？”

'_True synchronization.'_ “真正的同步。”

Unit 01 then stopped attacking sporadically and jumped backwards, glaring at the angel, almost like it had a mind now. Shinji then projected his thoughts in his own mind which were received by the Eva, via the connected nerves. Unit 01 then took off again, charging at the angel. This time though, instead of attacking randomly, it smashed its fists into the AT-field of the angel. Unit 01 quickly generated its own AT-field and attempted to rip apart the angels own AT-field.  
初号机随即停止了零星的攻击，向后一跃，瞪着使徒，仿佛此刻它也有了意识。真嗣在心中投射出自己的想法，通过连接的神经被 EVA 接收。初号机再次启动，向使徒冲去。这一次，它没有盲目攻击，而是用拳头猛击使徒的 AT 力场。初号机迅速生成自己的 AT 力场，试图撕裂使徒的 AT 力场。

Digging its nails into the angels AT-field it was able to open up a small hole. Quickly thrusting its head into the hole it let out a roar that shattered the remains of the angels AT-field. Quick as a flash, Unit 01 smashed both its fists into the side of the angel. The angel seemed to crumble slightly as Unit 01 repeatedly smashed its fists directly into the side of the angel.  
它用指甲刺入天使的 AT 力场，成功撕开了一个小洞。迅速将头探入洞中，发出一声咆哮，震碎了天使剩余的 AT 力场。零一机敏如闪电，双拳猛击天使的侧面。天使似乎微微崩塌，零一不断用拳头直接击打天使的侧面。

As Unit 01 was about to smash its fists into the side of the angel again, the angel quickly shifted so that it was able to fire its positron wave. A quick red flash appeared as the angel fired. Shinji reacted quicker though. Putting all his thoughts into the Eva's AT-field he projected a cone like AT-field which deflected the attack and sent it back towards the angel. The angel was able to deflect it though by firing another positron wave, make the first veer of course. That was all Shinji needed.  
正当零一准备再次用拳头击打天使的侧面时，天使迅速移动，发射出正电子波。一道快速的红光闪现，天使开火了。但真嗣反应更快。他将所有思绪集中在 EVA 的 AT 力场上，投射出一个锥形 AT 力场，将攻击偏转并反弹回天使。天使虽然通过发射另一道正电子波改变了第一道波的轨迹，但这正是真嗣所需要的。

Reacting to the three second window, Unit 01 quickly appeared in front of the angel, grabbing both sides of it. Gripping the sides of the angel, Unit 01 dug its fingers into the angel and by projecting a large AT-field between the two hands, tour off a large chunk of the angel. Black blood poured from the open wound and several large organs, caked with a substance like bone marrow, fell to the ground.  
在三秒窗口期内，初号机迅速出现在使徒面前，双手紧抓其两侧。初号机用手指深深嵌入使徒体内，通过在双手间投射出巨大的 AT 力场，撕下了一大块使徒的肉体。黑色的血液从撕裂的伤口中涌出，几块沾满类似骨髓物质的巨大器官也随之坠地。

Unit 01 let out a ferocious roar as it thrust its head directly into the open wound. Flesh and blood poured forth as Unit 01 dug inside the body of the angel. Shinji was slightly repulsed as he could feel the slimy taste of the flesh and the iron like blood pouring through his mouth, but he had to find it.  
初号机发出一声凶猛的咆哮，将头部直接插入那敞开的伤口中。血肉横飞，初号机深入使徒体内挖掘。真嗣感到一丝恶心，他能感受到那滑腻的肉质和铁锈般的血液涌入口中，但他必须找到那个东西。

After a few seconds of digging Unit 01 paused and ripped its head out the wound of the angel. The head was dripping in blood and some was pouring from the mouth. Something was in its mouth though, a red object that looked similar to a marble. With a quick clench of the teeth the red marble shattered and fell from the Eva's teeth.  
挖掘了几秒钟后，初号机停顿了一下，猛地将头从使徒的伤口中抽出。头部滴着血，有些血从口中流出。但它的嘴里确实含着什么，一个红色的物体，看起来像颗玛瑙。随着牙齿的迅速一咬，红色玛瑙碎裂，从 EVA 的齿间掉落。

With the core of the angel removed and destroyed the angel seemed to twist and writhe. Large chunks of flesh started to fall off and sink to the ground. Shinji watched this all in slow motion from the eyes of the Eva.  
随着天使的核心被移除并摧毁，天使似乎开始扭曲和蠕动。大块的肉体开始脱落并沉向地面。真嗣通过 Eva 的眼睛，以慢动作目睹了这一切。

"Pattern blue has disappeared, the angel has been defeated."  
「蓝色模式已消失，天使已被击败。」

Misato let out a shaky laugh and sank in her chair. She didn't even want to know how much time was left. Shinji's performance was incredible though. His sync rate read at seventy-two when he had disengaged combat. Even so the way he initiated combat was both reckless, and slightly scary. He didn't seem to show any emotion.  
美里发出颤抖的笑声，瘫坐在椅子上。她甚至不想知道还剩下多少时间。尽管如此，真嗣的表现还是令人难以置信。他在脱离战斗时的同步率达到了七十二。尽管如此，他发起战斗的方式既鲁莽又略显可怕。他似乎没有表现出任何情感。

Letting out a low sigh Misato said, "Bring in Unit 00 and 01, and get the has-mat team down there to start clean up." 'And get me a cold beer while your at it,' she thought.  
美里低声叹了口气，说道：“把零号机和初号机带进来，让防化小组下去开始清理。”她心里想着：‘顺便给我拿瓶冰啤酒。’

Shinji was rather hesitant as he stood outside of Misato's apartment, and rather mad at the conversation that had followed after he returned from fighting. Misato had scolded him about his way of fighting, saying that he was way to reckless and should have waited for back up from Rei. Shinji had retorted that he had defeated the angel so why should she be angry at him. He was honestly annoyed with Misato right now, but he was more worried about Asuka. She had to assume that something had happened judging by that fact that Shinji hadn't come home from school.  
真嗣站在美里的公寓外，相当犹豫，对战斗结束后发生的那场对话感到愤怒。美里责备他的战斗方式，说他太过鲁莽，应该等丽来支援。真嗣反驳说他已经打败了使徒，为什么她还要对他生气。他现在确实对美里感到恼火，但他更担心明日香。考虑到真嗣放学后还没回家，她不得不认为发生了什么事。

He was hoping that she might have gone to bed early and opened the door slowly hoping that he wouldn't wake her if she was asleep. However, when he opened the door he heard the blaring of the T.V. and assumed that she was still up. Tiptoeing his way into the living room he saw that Asuka was sprawled on the ground, with her head resting on a pillow, and entangled in a pile of blankets. At first he thought that she was sleeping but then he noticed that she had her head propped up in her hands.  
他希望她可能已经早早上床，于是慢慢地打开门，希望如果她在睡觉的话不会吵醒她。然而，当他打开门时，他听到了电视的轰鸣声，猜想她应该还没睡。他蹑手蹑脚地走进客厅，看到明日香四肢摊开躺在地上，头枕着一个枕头，被一堆毯子缠绕着。起初他以为她在睡觉，但随后注意到她用手撑着头。

She must have heard the door open because she sat up slowly, letting the blankets slide off her body, and turned towards the hallway where Shinji was standing. Shinji tried not to stare to much but it was rather difficult. She was wearing a white, loose, tank-top, with white and blue striped underwear, and appeared to have been laying there for a while. Rubbing her eyes slowly she squinted in Shinji's general direction.  
她一定是听到了开门声，因为她慢慢地坐了起来，让毯子从身上滑落，转向信二站立的走廊。信二尽量不盯着她看，但这相当困难。她穿着一件宽松的白色背心，搭配蓝白条纹的内裤，看起来已经在那里躺了一段时间。她慢慢地揉着眼睛，眯着眼睛朝信二的大致方向看去。

"Baka Shinji?" “笨蛋信二？”

"Yeah, and could you drop the baka?"  
"是啊，你能别再叫我笨蛋了吗？"

Asuka shrugged and went back to watching television. Shinji wasn't sure if he should go straight to sleep or risk an argument with her. Deciding that they were on friendly level and that he didn't want to break it he inched his way towards his room when he heard her accusing voice.  
明日香耸了耸肩，继续看电视。真嗣不确定自己是该直接睡觉，还是冒险和她争论。考虑到他们目前关系还算友好，他不想破坏这种状态，于是小心翼翼地朝自己的房间挪去，这时他听到了她责问的声音。

"Where are you going?" "你要去哪儿？"

Shinji paused for a second and said, "To bed. I'm sorta tired."  
真嗣顿了一下，说道：“去睡觉。我有点累了。”

Stealing a quick glance at the living room he saw that Asuka still hadn't moved.  
他迅速瞥了一眼客厅，看到明日香仍然没有动。

"You can go to bed later. I want to know why you fought the angel without me."  
“你可以晚点再睡。我想知道你为什么在没有我的情况下与使徒战斗。”

Shinji flinched. Of course she would have known about the angel attack. The JSDF would have announced something completely false was happening and that everyone had to evacuate to the shelters. Asuka would of course known that it was really an angel attack.  
真嗣畏缩了一下。她当然知道使徒袭击的事。日本自卫队肯定会宣布发生了完全虚假的事件，要求所有人撤离到避难所。明日香自然知道那实际上是使徒的攻击。

"Oh...that..." “哦...那个...”

"Oh that? Is that all you can say?"  
“哦，那个？你就只能说这个吗？”

"Can't you at least be a little thankful?"  
"你就不能至少表示一点感激吗？"

"For what!" "为了什么！"

"Look, you didn't go to school so I didn't think that you'd be able fight well enough. When Misato asked me where you were I said that you were sick and not feeling well."  
"听着，你没去上学，所以我没想到你能打得那么好。当美里问我你在哪儿时，我说你生病了，感觉不舒服。"

"That doesn't affect the synchro-"  
"那不会影响同步率——"

"I know! ...I was just looking out for you is all, because of last nig-"  
"我知道！……我只是关心你，因为昨晚的事——"

Shinji caught himself in mid sentence. Certainly mention of last night would set her off.  
真嗣话说到一半突然打住。提到昨晚的事肯定会惹她生气。

Asuka was frowning at Shinji, rather curiously. Shrugging she said, "Well it was rather relaxing anyway, and I certainly deserved the day off."  
明日香正皱着眉头好奇地看着真嗣。她耸耸肩说：“反正挺放松的，我确实该休息一天。”

Standing up she walked over to Shinji and had to tilt her head slightly up towards him. She just realized that he was slightly taller than her, though they were both the same age. "Don't let it happen again though." At her words she calmly extended her index finger and flicked it against his nose, catching Shinji completely off guard.  
她站起来，走到真嗣面前，不得不稍微抬头看他。她这才意识到他比自己稍高一些，尽管他们同龄。“不过别再有下次了。”她平静地伸出食指，轻轻弹了一下他的鼻子，真嗣完全没料到这一招。

Asuka turned around, her hair brushing against Shinji's face, and crawled back into the blankets.  
明日香转过身去，头发拂过真嗣的脸颊，然后钻回了被窝里。

Shinji continued standing there as though he was frozen. He had seriously thought that she was about to kiss him.  
真嗣继续站在那里，仿佛被冻住了一般。他真的以为她要吻他了。

After several seconds in which time seemed to freeze for Shinji, Asuka turned towards Shinji and frowned. "What's wrong with you?"  
在几秒钟的时间里，时间似乎对真嗣来说凝固了，明日香转向真嗣并皱起了眉头。“你怎么了？”

Shinji seemed to come out of his stupor and nervously said, "Nothing."  
真嗣似乎从恍惚中回过神来，紧张地说：“没什么。”

"Liar, you thought I was going to kiss you."  
"骗子，你以为我要吻你。"

Shinji blushed a deep crimson and waved his hands in front of his face, "No, I don't think of you like that."  
真嗣的脸颊涨得通红，双手在脸前挥舞着，"不，我没那么想你。"

Asuka rolled her eyes and turned back towards the T.V. "Grow some balls and start thinking like that then."  
明日香翻了个白眼，转身面向电视，"长点胆子，就该那么想。"

Shinji sighed and said, "What, you want me to think like that?"  
真嗣叹了口气，说道：“什么，你想让我那样想吗？”

It was Asuka's turn to be embarrassed as she quickly turned around before Shinji could see the pink tinge that had appeared on her face.  
轮到明日香感到尴尬了，她迅速转过身去，以免真嗣看到她脸上泛起的粉红色。

"Baka, just go to sleep already."  
“笨蛋，快去睡觉吧。”

"Yeah, yeah, I'm going." “是是，我这就走。”

Asuka kept her gaze fixed on the T.V. as Shinji left the room. When she heard his door closed she let out a low sigh and rolled over onto her back. Several emotion coursed through her which she didn't recognize, and all of them had something to do with Shinji. Turning off the T.V. she sat up and ran her hands through her hair. A small smile had appeared on her face.  
碇真嗣离开房间时，明日香目光依旧紧盯着电视。听到他的房门关闭声，她轻轻叹了口气，翻身仰躺。心中涌动着她辨认不清的情感，而这些情感无一不与真嗣有关。她关掉电视，坐起身来，双手穿过发丝，嘴角浮现出一抹淡淡的微笑。

Lilith sat with her back against the Tree of Life, staring forward across the empty plane, her thoughts residing on Shinji and where his actions would take him. Whether she herself had orchestrated things so that it would reach this conclusion, she didn't know. She had affected both there lives to a certain extent, but ultimately, they had always seemed to have been drawn together ever since they had first met those many months ago. Even if Shinji wasn't an angel, that the Evangelions had never existed, that herself and Adam had never warred with each other, Lilith knew that Shinji and Asuka would still have connected as they did. She had to admit...she was jealous in a way; the two of them had something that she had never had. Well, that wasn't quite true she supposed...  
莉莉丝背靠着生命之树坐着，凝视着前方空荡荡的位面，她的思绪集中在真嗣身上，以及他的行动将带他走向何方。到底是不是她自己精心策划的，才会导致这样的结果，她不知道。她在一定程度上影响了两人的生活，但最终，自从几个月前第一次见面以来，他们似乎总是被吸引在一起。即使真嗣不是天使，即使新世纪福音战士从未存在过，即使她自己和亚当从未交战过，莉莉丝也知道真嗣和明日香仍然会像他们一样联系在一起。她不得不承认……她在某种程度上是嫉妒的；她嫉妒了。他们两个拥有了她从未拥有过的东西。嗯，她认为这并不完全正确……

Lilith titled her head upwards, looking at the dark sky devoid of any stars. She wondered how Shinji would fair inside the Black Egg. It was very easy to get lost within the sea of people, all of which were the same. But Shinji loved Asuka enough, and that alone would be enough to find her. After that though...  
莉莉丝抬起头，望着没有星星的漆黑天空。她想知道真嗣在黑蛋里会怎样。人海里很容易迷失方向，所有人都一样。但真嗣足够爱明日香，仅此一点就足以找到她。但在那之后...

"Hey...Rei?" mumbled Lilith as she continued looking upward.  
「喂……雷？」莉莉丝一边低声说道，一边继续向上看。

From within her, Rei replied.  
丽从内心深处回答道。

"Are you still having doubts about those two?"  
“你对那两个人还有疑问吗？”

"Even if Asuka does agree to returning, the damage has already been done, both inside and out. Even though I promised Shinji that I would help, the only thing I can help with is-"  
「即使明日香同意回来，内里外外的伤害都已经造成了。虽然我答应真嗣会帮忙，但我唯一能帮忙的就是——」

"They will be able to shoulder that hardship, even if it does torment them for years to come. I have faith in them. Shinji and Asuka are entwined together as you thought so much so that one can't live without the other."  
“他们将能够承受这种困难，即使这会在未来的岁月里折磨他们。我对他们有信心。真嗣和明日香是纠缠在一起的，因为你想得太多了，以至于一个人不能没有另一个人生活。”

"Do you have any idea why that is? You were able to observe them better than I was after all."  
“你知道这是为什么吗？你毕竟比我能更好地观察它们。”

"I can only say that they are connected in a way rarely seen by humans in this day and age. They are very much incomplete, but together, they are more whole. They make up for each others faults and problems, and are able to understand each other because they share similarities. Love doesn't describe there bond so much as the need to be close to each other. Even if they had just stayed friends, they would have still desired that warmth of being near."  
“我只能说，它们以当今时代人类很少见的方式联系在一起。它们非常不完整，但组合在一起，它们就更完整了。它们弥补了彼此的缺点和问题，并且能够彼此理解，因为他们有相似之处。爱并不更多地描述了彼此之间的联系，即使他们只是朋友，他们仍然渴望接近的温暖。”

"Was there ever a possibility of them breaking apart?"  
“他们有分手的可能吗？”

"Even now that possibility still exists, but Shinji should be able to negate that. His actions have driven them this far after all."  
「虽然现在这种可能性仍然存在，但真嗣应该能够否定这种可能性。毕竟是他的行为让他们走到了这一步。」

Lilith was silent now, as Rei finished speaking, but something still lingered on her mind.  
雷说完，莉莉丝沉默了，但她的脑海里仍然残留着一些东西。

"Rei, I consider you as much a part of my mind as I do myself...so what will happen to Shinji after him and Asuka return."  
“丽，我认为你就像我自己一样是我思想的一部分……那么他和明日香回来后真嗣会发生什么。”

"Meaning?" “意义？”

"After I...help them I mean..."  
“在我……帮助他们之后，我的意思是……”

Rei did not reply for a long while here, and seemed to be deep in thought over something which had troubled her for a long while. Eventually though, she voiced her thoughts on the matter.  
丽在这里良久没有回复，似乎正在思考一件困扰她许久的事情。但最终，她还是表达了自己对此事的看法。

"I understand what you are getting at, and that will not change, so the possibility would exist."  
“我明白你的意思，这一点不会改变，所以这种可能性是存在的。”

"I see," sighed Lilith glumly. If possible, she didn't want something like that to happen, as it could send everything into turmoil once again, but that wouldn't be her decision after all. That would be something Shinji and Asuka would have to deal with when the time came, if it ever did of course.  
“我明白了，”莉莉丝闷闷不乐地叹了口气。如果可以的话，她不希望这样的事情发生，因为这会让一切再次陷入混乱，但这毕竟不是她的决定。这将是真嗣和明日香到时候必须处理的事情，当然，如果确实如此的话。

Shinji had never given much thought as to how many people lived on the earth, but having several billions people talking to you all at once put it into perspective. It was like having a constant ache in your ear, unable to get ride of it. Everybody recognize Shinji for who he was, an entity that was unique for everyone else, somebody that could help him. Some even ridiculed him, yelling at him, screaming for him to help them. But Shinji couldn't do anything for them. Visions and such flashed by him, but everything was so blurred and meshed together that he couldn't tell any one person apart from anyone else.  
真嗣从来没有过多考虑过地球上有多少人，但有数十亿人同时与你交谈，你就可以正确地看待这个问题了。就好像你的耳朵经常疼痛，无法缓解。每个人都认识真嗣，他是一个对其他人而言独一无二的个体，一个可以帮助他的人。有些人甚至嘲笑他，对他大喊大叫，尖叫着要他帮助他们。但真嗣却无法为他们做任何事。幻象之类的东西在他眼前一闪而过，但一切都是那么模糊、交织在一起，让他分不清谁是谁。

He continued moving forward through the sea of LCL fluid, floating helplessly as he let it carry him forward. He kept thinking of Asuka, hoping that his thoughts would carry him to wherever she was, but he his mind kept on being assaulted by everyone else's thoughts. He saw mothers, fathers, children, grandfathers and grandmothers. He saw people of all kinds of nationalities, religions, and races. Personalities meshed together like a melting pot, making Shinji's head feeling like splitting. But he had to move forward, because Asuka was somewhere within here.  
他继续在拼箱液的海洋中前行，无助地漂浮着，让它带着他前进。他一直想着明日香，希望他的思绪能把他带到她所在的任何地方，但他的思绪不断受到其他人的思绪的攻击。他看到了母亲、父亲、孩子、祖父和祖母。他见过各种国籍、宗教和种族的人。不同的性格就像一个大熔炉一样交织在一起，让真嗣的头仿佛要裂开了。但他必须继续前进，因为明日香就在这里面的某个地方。

What would he say when he saw her? "I'm sorry for not telling you I loved you sooner? Sorry that I caused all this? Sorry that I caused all your pain and suffering?" That wouldn't cut it. Shinji wanted to say these things though, even if Asuka still hated him. He wanted to be truthful and heartfelt for once, instead of always running away from everything. He had been running away from everything all his life, never truly standing and facing it. But now, he just wanted to be with Asuka, even if she rejected him, even if she loathed him. He just wanted to say those three simple words to her.  
当他看到她时，他会说什么？ “对不起，我没有早点告诉你我爱你？对不起，我造成了这一切？对不起，我造成了你所有的痛苦和磨难？”那不会削减它。尽管明日香仍然讨厌他，但真嗣还是想说这些。他想要一次真诚和真心，而不是总是逃避一切。他一生都在逃避一切，从未真正站起来、面对它。但现在，他只想和明日香在一起，哪怕她拒绝他，哪怕她厌恶他。他只想对她说这简单的三个字。

This thought is what kept Shinji sane as he continued through the sea of LCL fluid.  
这个想法让真嗣在拼箱液体的海洋中继续前行时保持理智。

'Who am I?' '我是谁？'

'You are you and no one else.'  
“你就是你，没有别人。”

'What makes up the fact that I am me?'  
“什么构成了我就是我这个事实？”

'What do you mean?' '你是什么意思？'

'How do I know that I am me and not someone else?'  
“我怎么知道我就是我，而不是别人？”

'Why do you think you are someone else?'  
“你为什么认为你是别人？”

'I don't think that but...things don't feel right...'  
“我不这么认为，但是……事情感觉不太对劲……”

'What doesn't feel right?'  
“什么感觉不对劲？”

'I don't feel right.' “我感觉不对劲。”

'Does it hurt?' “痛吗？”

'It does...it hurts a lot. This pain...I-I've felt it before, and...I don't like it.'  
‘确实……很疼。这种疼痛……我、我以前感受过，而且……我不喜欢它。

'So you think something is...missing?'  
“那么你认为有什么东西……丢失了？”

'I do...but I don't know what...'  
“我愿意……但我不知道什么……”

'What exactly hurts?' “到底是什么痛？”

'...My heart...a constant pain in my heart, like a fist is clenching ahold of it.'  
“……我的心……我的心持续疼痛，就像一只拳头紧握着一样。”

'Maybe you lost something?'  
“也许你丢了什么东西？”

'I...lost something? But what?'  
‘我……丢了什么东西？但什么？

'That is for you to figure out, not me.'  
“这是你要弄清楚的，而不是我。”

Asuka opened her eyes into whiteness.  
明日香睁开眼睛，眼前一片惨白。

She was floating...no laying within a vast empty space of whiteness that seemed to stretch onward forever. She sat up, and looked around, searching for any distinguishing figure, but everything was still white.  
她漂浮着……不是躺在一片巨大的白色空间里，那片空间似乎永远向前延伸。她坐起身来，环顾四周，寻找任何明显的人影，但一切仍然是白色的。

"Where am I?" she wondered.  
“我在哪里？”她想知道。

Her voice, instead of echoing, seemed to be swallowed by the whiteness.  
她的声音不但没有回响，反而像是被白色吞噬了。

Standing up, she firstly noticed that she was naked, but this didn't seem to bother her for some reason. She ran her hands along her body, remembering the feel of it. Things were starting to come back to her. She placed a hand between her breasts, shuddering as she recalled the feel of the Lance of Longinus as it impaled her. She then ran her hand behind her head, running it through her hair. She also remembered the instantaneous death that had killed her. The pain, the horror, the feel of slipping away, and-  
站起来，她首先注意到自己赤身裸体，但不知为何，她似乎并没有对此感到困扰。她用手抚摸着自己的身体，回忆着那种感觉。她的心开始回过神来。她将一只手放在胸前，回想起朗基努斯之枪刺穿她的感觉，她不寒而栗。然后她把手放在脑后，梳理头发。她还记得杀死她的瞬间死亡。痛苦、恐惧、溜走的感觉，还有——

"Shinji," whispered Asuka.  
“真嗣，”明日香低声说道。

As she spoke his name, her heart seared with pain, bringing her to her knees. Her eyes opened wide as she remembered that last feel of his touch before she had been killed. The warmth that had passed between them, it felt so familiar.  
当她说出他的名字时，她的心一阵剧痛，让她跪倒在地。当她想起她被杀之前他最后一次触摸的感觉时，她睁大了眼睛。他们之间传递的温暖，感觉是那么熟悉。

Once again, Asuka's heart seared at this thought.  
想到这里，明日香的心再次变得灼热起来。

'What is wrong with me?' wondered Asuka.  
'我是怎么了？'明日香想知道。

Asuka stood up again, and started walking aimlessly in one direction, still looking for any noticeable landmark, but she seemed to be the only person within this space.  
明日香再次站起来，漫无目的地朝一个方向走去，仍在寻找任何明显的地标，但这个空间里似乎只有她一个人。

'Lonely again...huh?' thought Asuka sadly as she paused and looked around her. But hadn't that been how everything always was? She had never had friends in high school or college, and her father had always abused her. She had only ever had her Eva, but now that was even gone. And now with Shinji gone she was-  
“又孤独了……嗯？”明日香停下来环顾四周，悲伤地想。但一切不都是这样吗？她在高中或大学期间从未有过朋友，她的父亲总是虐待她。她曾经只有她的伊娃，但现在它甚至消失了。现在真嗣走了，她——

Asuka's heart ached with pain, but this time, her head felt like it had been cloven asunder as it brought her to the ground. She sank down, clutch both her hand and where her heart was. Everything about Shinji was-  
明日香的心一阵剧痛，但这一次，她的头就像被劈成两半一样，把她摔倒在地。她坐了下来，紧紧抓住自己的手和心脏所在的地方。关于真嗣的一切都是——

'If it hurts, then just don't think about it.'  
“如果很痛，那就别想了。”

'But I can't stop thinking about him,' replied Asuka as she felt pain hit her. 'After all, Shinji is someone that I-'  
“但我无法停止想他，”明日香回答道，她感到疼痛袭来。 “毕竟，真嗣是我——”

Asuka opened her eyes and looked around wildly. For a split second, she had thought she saw...no, she did see something. A bubble, completely round was floating effortlessly in the vast whiteness. Asuka stared at it for a long, while not believing what she was seeing. But as Asuka continued watching, several bubbles continued appearing, one right after the other in front of her until the entire place was filled with these strange bubbles.  
明日香睁开眼睛，疯狂地环顾四周。有那么一瞬间，她以为自己看到了……不，她确实看到了一些东西。一个浑圆的气泡，在浩瀚的白色之中，毫不费力地漂浮着。明日香盯着它看了很久，不敢相信自己所看到的。但随着明日香继续观察，几个气泡不断出现，一个接一个地出现在她的面前，直到整个地方都充满了这些奇怪的气泡。

Asuka stood up slowly, staring at the bubbles around her. As one neared her, she moved away from it, though as it passed her, she noticed something inside of it. Looking closer, she saw images flashing inside it.  
明日香缓缓站起身来，盯着周围的气泡。当其中一个靠近她时，她就远离它，但当它经过她时，她注意到里面有什么东西。仔细一看，她发现里面有影像在闪烁。

'Thats...me? And Misato? And...Shin...ji?"  
'这就是我？还有美里呢？还有……真……？”

Asuka gazed at the bubble, inside which showed herself, Misato, and Shinji, all gathered around the kitchen table of Misato apartment and eating breakfast. Both Shinji and Asuka were in there school uniforms, and Misato seemed to be about ready to leave for Nerv. Asuka watched as she yelled something at Shinji, who promptly stood up and grabbed something from the fridge. The her inside the bubble then said something else, making Shinji retort back as well. Very quickly, the two started arguing with each other across the kitchen table, while Misato seemed to be completely oblivious to this, making it apparent that it happened all to frequently.  
明日香凝视着气泡，里面出现了她自己、美里和真嗣，他们都围在美里公寓的厨房桌子旁吃着早餐。真嗣和明日香都穿着校服，美里似乎正准备出发去涅夫。明日香看着她对真嗣大喊大叫，真嗣立刻站起来，从冰箱里抓起一样东西。泡泡里的她又说了些什么，真嗣也反驳道。很快，两人就隔着餐桌争吵起来，而美里似乎完全没有注意到这一点，显然这一切都发生得很频繁。

"Is this...my memory?" mumbled Asuka as she reached towards the bubble. As her fingers touched it, it immediately popped, clear fluid like tear drops falling from it.  
“这……是我的记忆吗？”明日香一边向泡泡伸出手，一边咕哝道。当她的手指触碰到它的时候，它立刻爆开，透明的液体如泪珠般从里面流了下来。

Asuka felt something then, almost like a jolt of some sorts, like something had just struck her. A shiver ran down her back, and she had to wrap her arms around her body to prevent herself from shivering.  
明日香感觉到了什么，几乎像​​是某种震动，就像有什么东西刚刚击中了她。她的后背一阵颤抖，她不得不用双臂抱住自己的身体，才不至于发抖。

But she remembered now...that day. So Shinji had lived with her at Misato's apartment.  
但她现在想起来了……那天。所以真嗣和她一起住在美里的公寓里。

"Then all of these...all of these are my memories?"  
“那这一切……都是我的记忆？”

Asuka looked at all of them, and saw that all of them had one thing in common: they all had Shinji in them.  
明日香看着他们所有人，发现他们都有一个共同点：他们都有真嗣。

"These are...the memories I lost?"  
“这些就是……我失去的记忆？”

Asuka watched as her memories floated by her, each with Shinji in them. She saw her and Shinji at school, in the apartment, and even fighting angels.  
明日香看着她的记忆从她身边飘过，每一个记忆里都有真嗣。她在学校、在公寓、甚至在战斗天使中都看到了她和真嗣。

Asuka then noticed a particular memory, showing her and Shinji sitting side by side and listening to something that looked like a tape recorder. She reached her hands towards this one, and touched it briefly with her index finger. It immediately popped, and she was assaulted again by a strange jolt, but the memories that flowed from this were startling, and Asuka surprisingly found herself laughing.  
明日香随后注意到了一段特殊的记忆，显示她和真嗣并排坐着，听着类似录音机的东西。她把手伸向这个，用食指轻轻触碰了一下。它立即弹出，她再次受到一种奇怪的震动的袭击，但由此产生的记忆令人震惊，明日香惊讶地发现自己笑了。

She was remembering when her and Shinji had to be completely synchronized with each other to defeat the fifth angel. The torment of having to do everything together, that damn machine, the stupid clothes they had to wear for the entire thing...and of course, sleeping in the same room. But it made Asuka smile slightly, as she knew that things were much easier then than now.  
她记得她和真嗣必须完全同步才能击败第五天使。必须一起做所有事情的折磨，那台该死的机器，他们必须穿着愚蠢的衣服来完成整个事情……当然，还有睡在同一个房间。但这让明日香微微一笑，因为她知道那时候的事情比现在容易多了。

But-

"What is this?" mumbled Asuka in shock.  
“这是什么？”明日香震惊地嘟哝道。

She had just remembered when her father had come looking for her.  
她这才想起来，父亲来找她的时候。

This time, Asuka's heart hurt in a different way, bringing up memories she had long sealed within herself. She felt nauseous, sick with pain as she saw herself stand there in shock, saw as Shinji stood there defending her, pure hatred etched into his face. Another memory, another memory must have existed before this.  
这一次，明日香的心以不同的方式疼痛，唤起了她封印已久的记忆。当她看到自己震惊地站在那里，看到真嗣站在那里保护她时，她感到恶心，疼痛难忍，脸上刻满了纯粹的仇恨。另一种记忆，另一种记忆在此之前一定已经存在了。

Fighting off the sense of worry that plagued her now, Asuka searched for a memory which could tie the two together. She found one that caught her attention almost instantly. In the memory, she saw herself pressing her face against Shinji's shoulder, tears running down her face. Shinji had his hands wrapped around her waist as he comforted her. Whatever it was...Asuka was nervous about the memory, but her desire to know what happened won her over.  
明日香奋力摆脱现在困扰她的忧虑，寻找能够将两人联系在一起的记忆。她几乎立刻就发现了一个引起她注意的东西。记忆中，她看见自己把脸贴在真嗣的肩膀上，泪水顺着脸颊流下来。真嗣双手环住她的腰，安抚着她。不管是什么……明日香对这段记忆感到紧张，但她想知道发生了什么的渴望赢得了她的支持。

She touched it, and felt a fresh flood of memories hit her.  
她摸了摸它，感觉一股新鲜的记忆涌向她。

Herself and Shinji were talking about themselves openly, seemingly for the first time. Asuka told Shinji all about growing up with her father, and the torment that she had undergone until she left for college. Asuka felt the weakness hit her as she remembered how she had felt when she had broken down and cried into Shinji's shoulder. Her knees wobbled slightly, and she had to prevent herself from falling.  
她自己和真嗣似乎是第一次公开谈论自己。明日香向真嗣讲述了她和父亲一起长大的一切，以及她在上大学之前所经历的折磨。当明日香想起自己崩溃并靠在真嗣肩头哭泣时的感受时，她感到全身无力。她的膝盖微微颤抖，她必须防止自己跌倒。

"So...Shinji already knew about my father before they met," gasped Asuka as she pressed a hand against her chest.  
“所以……真嗣在他们见面之前就已经知道我父亲了，”明日香喘着气说道，她一只手按在胸前。

But what happened then? Asuka thought back to when her father had answered the door. She had been scared, because her father wanted to talk to her, but Shinji wasn't going to allow it. But then what? Everything else afterwards was one giant blank. And how was this possible? She didn't remember ever meeting her father, nor had Misato or anyone else even bothered to mention that he had showed up.  
但后来发生了什么？明日香回想起父亲开门的时候。她很害怕，因为她的父亲想和她说话，但真嗣不允许。但然后呢？之后的一切都是一片巨大的空白。这怎么可能呢？她不记得曾经见过她的父亲，美里或其他人甚至懒得提及他曾出现过。

Something must have happened...  
一定是发生了什么事情……

Asuka turned back to her memories, searching for something she didn't want to find, but she had to know. She had to know what had happened with her and Shinji.  
明日香回到记忆中，寻找着一些她不想找到，但又必须知道的东西。她必须知道她和真嗣之间发生了什么。

She looked around again, looking for anything that might speak to her. What would it be though? Asuka saw many memories, most seemingly just day to day things involving Shinji. Some intrigued her though, but it didn't seem to be one she was looking for, but she marked it all the same, wanting to come back to it later.  
她再次环顾四周，寻找任何可能对她说话的东西。那会是什么？明日香看到了很多记忆，大部分似乎只是与真嗣有关的日常事务。虽然有些东西引起了她的兴趣，但这似乎不是她要找的东西，但她还是做了标记，想稍后再回来看。

One jumped out at her though. She saw herself walking up the steps of Misato's apartment, rain lashing against her shoulders. She was wearing a sleeveless shirt with jeans cut off at the knees and a pair of sandals, something that suitable for the rain. Asuka watched as she walked to Misato's door and knocked on it. Several seconds later, the door was flung open, and Shinji stood there.  
不过，有一个人向她跳了过来。她看见自己走上美里公寓的台阶，雨水拍打着她的肩膀。她穿着一件无袖衬衫，搭配膝盖处剪裁的牛仔裤，脚上是一双适合下雨天穿的凉鞋。明日香看着她走到美里的门前，敲响了门。几秒后，门被推开，真嗣站在那里。

Asuka didn't have to look any further to know this was the memory she was looking for.  
明日香不用再看就知道这就是她要找的记忆。

She reached out with timid fingers, and touched it.  
她胆怯地伸出手指，触碰了它。

She was immediately hit by a sense of cold, as though she herself had just been splashed with ice cold water. The rest of the memory came to her. She remembered how Shinji had held her as she broke down completely, repeatedly saying his name more desperately than before. The next part made her blush a little though. She saw as Shinji fought her out of her soggy wet clothes, but let out a sigh as she remembered taking things into her own hands. If Shinji had continued, Asuka would have died of embarrassment.  
她顿时感觉浑身冰凉，就好像自己被泼了一盆冰水。剩下的记忆又浮现在她的脑海里。她记得当她彻底崩溃时，真嗣抱着她，比以前更加绝望地一遍又一遍地喊着他的名字。接下来的部分却让她脸红了一些。她看到真嗣把她从湿漉漉的衣服中挣脱出来，但当她想起自己把事情掌握在自己手中时，她叹了口气。如果真嗣继续下去的话，明日香就会羞愧而死。

Afterwards, the explanation came, which Asuka admittedly didn't care about. Everything was fitting together so perfectly, but it still felt like she was remembering it all from a third perspective. It was hard to believe that this all had transpired.  
随后有解释，明日香承认对此并不在意。一切都那么完美地结合在一起，但她仍然感觉这一切都是从第三个角度来回忆的。很难相信这一切都发生了。

But what happened next. 但接下来发生了什么。

Everything was a blur suddenly.  
一切突然变得模糊起来。

Asuka saw as her father returned with Misato in tow. How he had said he wanted to talk to her, how she had stood up for herself. And then-  
明日香看到父亲带着美里回来了。他如何说他想和她谈谈，她如何为自己辩护。进而-

Asuka heard those words that her father had spoken, and before anything else, she saw Shinji crashing his fist against her fathers jaw. Asuka remembered hearing the sound of the bone snapping, the impact as Shinji's fist collided against the side of her fathers temple. The bright red color as blood spewed forth from his mouth. Asuka felt herself almost unable to deal with it, but a part of her also remembered the feeling from that time.  
明日香听到了父亲所说的话，然后首先看到真嗣用拳头猛击父亲的下巴。明日香记得听到骨头折断的声音，以及真嗣的拳头撞击到她父亲太阳穴侧面时的冲击力。鲜红的血液，从他的口中喷涌而出。明日香觉得自己几乎无法应对，但她的一部分也想起了当时的感觉。

It was one of relief, and she hated herself for feeling that now. She knew everything that her father had done to her, but he was still her father.  
这是一种解脱，她恨自己现在有这种感觉。她知道父亲对她所做的一切，但他仍然是她的父亲。

'Is it right to feel like this?' she wondered as she saw Misato attempt to reprimand Shinji, only to have him brush it off.  
“这样的感觉对吗？”当她看到美里试图斥责真嗣时，她感到很奇怪，但他却置若罔闻。

Surely it was understandable? But she couldn't help wonder where her father was at that moment.  
这当然是可以理解的吗？但她不禁想知道父亲此时在哪里。

Afterwards, Asuka remembered herself going into Shinji's room to seek comfort, though it had been awkward, and she remembered not being able to say what was truly on her mind then. She was saddened by this, sad that so many opportunities had come, but she had let them slip through her grasp.  
之后，明日香记得自己走进真嗣的房间寻求安慰，尽管这很尴尬，而且她记得当时无法说出自己真正的想法。她为此感到悲伤，悲伤的是这么多的机会来了，但她却让它们从她的手中溜走了。

She now took a deep breath, and opened and closed her eyes. As much as her memories intrigued her, they took a lot out of her. Remembering what she felt at the time was particularly exhausting.  
她现在深吸了一口气，睁开又闭上眼睛。尽管她的记忆让她着迷，但它们却让她失去了很多。回想起当时的感受，她特别心累。

Looking at her memories though, she noticed the ones from earlier that she had marked. Flashes of her and Shinji doing things filled the memory, and Asuka walked over to it, staring at it. She watched as her and Shinji went to an italian restaurant, ate ice cream, and walked around an exhibit of pre-Second Impact oceanic animals.  
不过，翻看她的记忆，她注意到了之前她标记过的那些。记忆中充满了她和真嗣做事的画面，明日香走过去，盯着它看。她看着她和真嗣去了一家意大利餐厅，吃了冰淇淋，并在第二次撞击前的海洋动物展览中散步。

'Is this...a date?' wondered Asuka as she continued looking at the memory. She slowly stretched her hand out to it, and grasped it.  
“这是……约会吗？”明日香一边思考着，一边继续看着记忆。她缓缓伸出手，握住了它。

Her mind was instantly filled with memories from that day. She saw as her and Shinji walked around the ocean exhibit, albeit not talking to each other for a while, though after a time, they seemed to make up. Then they entered a gift shop, and Asuka seem to realize something then, seconds before it happened. She was waiting outside when Shinji came out, and Asuka watched as he gave her the dolphin earrings that she treasured. Asuka felt tears well up at the corner of her eyes as she felt herself overcome with happiness, remembering the feelings that coursed through her at that moment in time. She watched as her and Shinji embraced each other; watched as she pressed her face against his shirt, and Shinji buried his face in her fiery hair.  
她的脑海里顿时充满了那天的回忆。她看到她和真嗣绕着海洋展览走来走去，虽然有一段时间没有互相交谈，但过了一段时间，他们似乎又和好了。然后他们进入了一家礼品店，明日香似乎在事情发生前几秒钟意识到了什么。当真嗣出来时，她正在外面等着，明日香看着他把她珍藏的海豚耳环交给了她。明日香回忆起那一刻的感受，眼角涌出泪水，幸福感溢于言表。她看着自己和真嗣拥抱在一起。看着她把脸贴在他的衬衫上，真嗣把脸埋进她火热的头发里。

And then Misato, Ritsuko, and Kaji showed up. Even now, Asuka knew that she shouldn't have done that. She had been embarrassed when they had seen herself and Shinji, and had immediately turned defensive.  
然后美里、律子和梶就出现了。即使现在，明日香也知道自己不应该这么做。当他们看到自己和真嗣时，她感到很尴尬，并立即变得防御起来。

She watched as they slowly made there way towards the beach, and the eventual water fight that ensued between them. Asuka remembered as they lay beside each other, talking aimlessly about meeting each other. Feelings were shared during that moment, even if they weren't spoken aloud. Afterwards though, when Asuka remembered what she had done, she blushed crimson. She remembered the feel as her lips came into contact with Shinji's forehead, and even though it was intended to be friendly, something was concealed in it.  
她看着他们慢慢地走向海滩，最后他们之间发生了水战。明日香记得他们躺在一起，漫无目的地谈论着见面的事。在那一刻，即使没有大声说出，人们也表达了自己的感受。但事后，明日香想起自己的所作所为，不禁脸红了。她记得自己的嘴唇接触真嗣额头时的感觉，虽然是出于友好，但其中却隐藏着某种东西。

She stood there, surrounded by her memories and she thought about what she had seen and felt so far. What Shinji had said before...when she had been alive, about them being friends...they had certainly been more than just friends. They had loved each other, even if it had never been spoken, and even now, they seemed to still love each other. So then why had Shinji lied again even at the end of everything? Was he still trying to protect her, or was he just trying to protect himself?  
她站在那里，周围都是她的回忆，她回想着迄今为止所见所感。真嗣之前说过……当她还活着的时候，他们是朋友……他们肯定不仅仅是朋友。他们曾经彼此相爱，即使从未说过，即使是现在，他们似乎仍然相爱。那么为什么真嗣在一切结束后又再次撒谎呢？他到底是想保护她，还是只是想保护自己？

Asuka shook her head as she thought back to that day and everything that had transpired. Everything that had happened was a clear example of who they were to each other. Even after she lost her memories, and Shinji denied everything that had happened, they still loved each other. So wasn't that enough? Shouldn't they just accept it? If you love someone, shouldn't you just express that love to the person you feel for?  
明日香摇了摇头，回想起那天以及所发生的一切。所发生的一切都清楚地表明了他们对彼此的看法。即使在她失去记忆、真嗣否认所发生的一切之后，他们仍然彼此相爱。那么这还不够吗？难道他们不应该接受吗？如果你爱一个人，你不应该向你所爱的人表达你的爱吗？

But they were also both fifteen, and had never known love of any form, so it was all so confusing.  
但他们也都十五岁了，从来不知道任何形式的爱情，所以这一切都是那么令人困惑。

Asuka looked back at her memories, now looking for one in particular. She wanted to find the one that had ended everything, the last memory before she had lost them. If she could trust what Ritsuko had said before, it had been an angel that had destroyed her memories of Shinji. So if she found something that looked like that-  
明日香回顾自己的记忆，现在正在寻找一个特别的记忆。她想要找到那个结束一切的人，找到她失去一切之前的最后一段记忆。如果她能相信律子之前所说的话，那么摧毁她关于真嗣的记忆的就是天使。所以如果她发现了类似的东西——

'Maybe this is it,' thought Asuka as she turned towards her right and saw one memory in particular. It didn't show Shinji, only herself enclosed in a white area, similar to the one she was in. She had her hands covering her head and was screaming something.  
“也许就是这样，”明日香想道，她转向右侧，看到了一个特别的记忆。它没有显示真嗣，只有她自己被包围在一个白色区域中，类似于她所在的区域。她双手捂着头，正在尖叫着什么。

Asuka neared this one, and looked at it closer. This was likely it...but remembering something like this, was that necessarily the best thing to do? Asuka continued staring at it, trying to understand the words she was saying. Something like this maybe...  
明日香靠近这个，仔细观察。大概就是这样……但是记住这样的事情，就一定是最好的事情吗？明日香继续盯着它，试图理解她所说的话。类似这样的事情也许...

But she reached forward anyway, and touched it.  
但她还是向前伸出手，触摸了它。

Pain exploded inside of Asuka's head. She screamed out, remembering the feel as her mind was violated, everything laid forth for the angel to see. Everything that she had ever happened during her childhood, she remembered, many things that she had done with Shinji, she saw and felt. And then-  
明日香的脑袋里一阵剧痛。她尖叫起来，回想起她的心灵被侵犯的感觉，一切都摆在天使面前。童年时发生的一切，她都记得，她和真嗣一起做过的许多事情，她都亲眼所见，感受到。进而-

Asuka's eyes turned white as the pain became unbearable. She felt hands touch her, running all along her body, grasping her painfully. She bit down on her tongue, preventing herself from screaming out. She saw a face, a horrible face which made her cringe, made her lose herself completely.  
疼痛变得难以忍受，明日香的眼睛变成了白色。她感觉到有双手抚摸着她，沿着她的身体，痛苦地抓着她。她咬住舌头，不让自己尖叫出来。她看到了一张脸，一张可怕的脸，让她感到畏缩，让她完全失去了自我。

And then it stopped. 然后它就停了。

Asuka fell to the ground, her body covered in sweat as she shivered uncontrollably. Everything...she had relived everything in a seconds notice, even things she didn't fully understand. She felt strange, disgusted, weak, violated. Her head hurt, her body hurt, her heart heart. Things were foggy, her recovered memories of Shinji blurred around the edges.  
明日香倒在地上，浑身都是汗，无法控制地颤抖着。一切……她在一瞬间就重温了一切，甚至是她不完全理解的事情。她感到奇怪、厌恶、软弱、被侵犯。她的头很痛，她的身体很痛，她的心也很痛。事情变得扑朔迷离，她恢复的有关真嗣的记忆也变得模糊起来。

'No...I don't want this...this pain,' thought Asuka.  
“不……我不想这样……这种痛苦，”明日香想。

'This is the price that comes with remembering everything again. You remember the good, and the bad.'  
“这就是再次记住一切的代价。”你会记住好的和坏的。

'No...no...' wined Asuka.  
“不……不……”明日香喝道。

From in front of her, came a memory unlike the others, a memory with no images, only black. Asuka saw this memory, and immediately knew that this was a bad memory, something that she never wanted to see. She stood up slowly, bracing herself as she did so. No matter what, she didn't want to know what-  
从她的面前，传来了一段与其他人不同的记忆，一段没有图像，只有黑色的记忆。明日香看到这段记忆，立刻就知道这是一段不好的记忆，是她永远不想看到的。她慢慢地站了起来，同时也做好了准备。无论如何，她不想知道什么——

The memory suddenly surged forward, enclosing Asuka's entire body in darkness. She was immediately thrown back to that time, that point in when she had been at her weakness. She saw the face, felt the breath of him, the feel as he touched her body. She wanted to scream out for help, but nobody was nearby, nobody to help her. He hit her repeatedly, tore at her body, mocked her. She wasn't going to make it...he was getting closer. The pain hit her; her heart cried out for help, her mind was growing hazy.  
记忆猛然向前涌动，将明日香的全身笼罩在黑暗之中。她立刻就被抛回到了那个时候，那个她最软弱的时候。她看到了他的脸，感觉到了他的呼吸，感觉到了他触碰她身体的感觉。她想大声呼救，但附近没有人，也没有人帮助她。他不断地打她，撕扯她的身体，嘲笑她。她不会成功的……他越来越近了。疼痛向她袭来；她的心在呼喊救命，她的思绪越来越模糊。

Bright light suddenly broke through the darkness, and Asuka saw Shinji standing there, an odd glow seeming to radiate off of him. His eyes glowed bright red as he marched towards the rapist. It happened in an orange flash of light. The body was torn asunder. Bone was crushed, limbs were shredded, fluid sprayed across the ground, and the head was turned into a ground meat.  
明亮的光芒突然冲破了黑暗，明日香看到真嗣站在那里，身上似乎散发着奇怪的光芒。当他走向强奸犯时，他的眼睛发出鲜红的光芒。事情发生在一道橙色的闪光中。身体被撕裂了。骨头被压碎，四肢被撕碎，液体喷洒在地上，头颅也变成了肉末。

Asuka shivered uncontrollably, her mind still hazy. This was...this was...  
明日香无法控制地颤抖着，她的大脑仍然一片混沌。这是……这是……

Something which should have stayed buried.  
一些本应被埋葬的东西。

The attempted rape, Shinji's ascension, the two things wove a web within Asuka's mind, preventing her to think of anything else. She could remember the feel of the hands, smell the blood, hear the crushing of the skull.  
强奸未遂，真嗣的升天，这两件事在明日香的脑海中编织了一张网，让她无法思考其他事情。她记得手的感觉、血的味道、头骨破碎的声音。

She felt like puking. 她感觉想吐。

How could she have forgotten something like this? But it was best that she had forgotten it...and now that she had.  
她怎么会忘记这样的事情？但最好她已经忘记了……现在她已经忘记了。

The feel...the feel of helplessness...even now it still.  
那种感觉……那种无助的感觉……至今依然如此。

"Shinji," mumbled Asuka as she sat there, staring at the white ground.  
“真嗣，”明日香坐在那里，盯着白色的地面，咕哝道。

It was overpowering her, that feel. Unable to do anything, never able to do a thing. Her father, the angel, the rapist. It all felt too real. She didn't know how to-  
那种感觉压倒了她。什么都做不了，什么都做不了。她的父亲，天使，强奸犯。这一切都感觉太真实了。她不知道如何——

Asuka suddenly felt her eyes lose focus. No! Not now! If you pass out now-  
明日香突然感觉自己的目光失去了焦点。不！现在不要！如果你现在昏倒了-

Asuka forced herself to fight the pain. She could beat it, she had before.  
明日香强迫自己对抗疼痛。她可以战胜它，她以前就做到了。

But that was because Shinji was with her, and now without him-  
但那是因为真嗣和她在一起，而现在他不在了——

Asuka tilted to her right, and fell to the ground, tears streaming from her eyes. Even if she could remember Shinji, having him by her side wasn't the same. If only she could feel him, know that he was still somewhere out there. But she didn't even know where was.  
明日香向右倾斜，倒在地上，泪水从眼中流淌出来。即使她记得真嗣，有他在她身边也不一样。如果她能感觉到他，知道他还在外面的某个地方就好了。但她根本不知道这是哪里。

Everything was too overpowering. Her memories held cherished thoughts, but they also held bitter ones, sad ones, ones that were too painful to think about. She wanted everything to just slip away. If this was how things would be, then she would rather not have remembered any of this.  
一切都太过势不可挡。她的记忆里有珍贵的想法，但也有苦涩的、悲伤的、痛苦不堪的想法。她希望一切就这么溜走。如果事情真的是这样，那她宁愿不记得这一切。

'It hurts,' mumbled Asuka. 'It hurts a lot.'  
“很痛。”明日香咕哝道。 '非常疼。'

And without anybody there to comfort her, Asuka slowly started to slip away...  
没有人安慰她，明日香慢慢地开始溜走……

---

Shinji was starting to get desperate. He had no idea how long it had been since he had entered the black sphere, but he still hadn't managed to find Asuka. What was he doing wrong? Why wasn't he able to find her. Was it impossible as Lilith had hinted at? But he was trying with everything he had damn it! If he wasn't able to find Asuka...  
真嗣开始绝望了。他不知道自己进入黑色球体已经有多久了，但他仍然没有找到明日香。他做错了什么？为什么他找不到她。难道真像莉莉丝暗示的那样不可能吗？但他正在竭尽全力地尝试！如果他找不到明日香的话……

'No, don't think like that,' Shinji told himself. 'Everything will be fine!'  
“不，不要这样想，”真嗣告诉自己。 '一切都会好起来的！'

But there was a small voice in the back of his mind that asked, 'What if?'  
但他内心深处有一个小小的声音问：“如果呢？”

Shinji didn't want to answer what if.  
真嗣不想回答“如果”的话。

The LCL fluid still seemed to have a mind of its own, and just carried him wherever it pleased. Even though Shinji had his mind on Asuka, it still didn't seem to be enough.  
拼箱液体似乎仍然有自己的意志，可以带着他去任何它想去的地方。尽管真嗣把心思放在明日香身上，但似乎还不够。

So then what did he have to do?  
那么他必须做什么呢？

Shinji had managed to tune most of the voices out by then, so that wasn't the problem here. It was like the LCL fluid didn't want him to go to where Asuka was.  
那时真嗣已经成功地消除了大部分声音，所以这不是这里的问题。就好像拼箱液不想让他去明日香所在的地方一样。

'Fuck that,' thought Shinji bitterly as he paused in the midst of the LCL fluid. He looked all around him, looking for anything that might help him. Asuka was somewhere within here right now, and Shinji new that she needed him. Some of her memories were best left untouched if at all possible, if she did remember them...  
“操，”真嗣在拼箱液体中间停了下来，痛苦地想。他环顾四周，寻找任何对他有帮助的东西。明日香现在就在这儿的某个地方，真嗣得知她需要他。如果可能的话，她的一些记忆最好不要被触及，如果她确实记得的话……

'Damn it,' thought Shinji.  
“该死，”真嗣想。

Now stationary, Shinji put all his thoughts into Asuka, and projected his AT-field outward, searching for her. The AT-field was an embodiment of who he is as a person, and with his feelings of Asuka projected into it, he should hopefully be able to find her.  
真嗣一动不动，将全部心思集中在明日香身上，向外投射AT力场，寻找她。 AT场是他这个人的体现，加上他对明日香的感情投射到其中，他应该有希望能够找到她。

But after many times of searching, Shinji didn't seem to be able to find Asuka. It was almost like she wasn't even there.  
但经过多次寻找，真嗣似乎都没有找到明日香。就好像她根本不存在一样。

'Is that possible though?' wondered Shinji. 'Could she be somewhere else?'  
“那可能吗？”真嗣想知道。 “她会不会在别的地方？”

But if she wasn't here, then where would she be?  
但如果她不在这里，那么她会在哪里？

'No, she had to be here, Lilith was sure of that much. But the problem is where. She likely sectioned herself off from everyone else, because of her grasp on herself, so that would mean-'  
“不，她必须在这里，莉莉丝确信这一点。但问题是在哪里。她很可能因为对自己的掌控而将自己与其他人隔离开来，所以这意味着——”

"Is there another part of this place?" mumbled Shinji. He didn't really see how there could be, unless Asuka had somehow created it herself.  
“这个地方还有别的地方吗？”真嗣咕哝道。他真的不明白怎么会有这种东西，除非明日香自己创造了它。

Shinji looked around him, but only saw LCL fluid that went on forever. But even so, the voices had diminished so that he didn't hear them as clearly anymore. It was like he had reached a different part of the sphere almost.  
真嗣环顾四周，却只看到了一直持续不断的拼箱液体。但即便如此，声音还是变小了，他听得不太清楚了。就好像他几乎到达了球体的另一个部分。

'More than anything else, I want to find Asuka right. To find her...and tell her anything. If those feelings aren't strong enough...'  
“最重要的是，我想找到明日香的正确身份。找到她……并告诉她任何事情。如果这些感觉还不够强烈的话……”

Once again, Shinji projected his AT-field outward, this time in a different direction.  
真嗣再一次向外投射他的AT力场，这次是在不同的方向。

'Asuka...Asuka...where are you right now? Are you lonely? What are you doing right now? What are you thinking? I want to see you...'  
“明日香……明日香……你现在在哪里？你孤单吗？你现在在做什么？你在想什么？我要见你...'

Shinji felt something strike his heart then, heard something almost echo inside of him. What was it? Something that was conjured up, something from a long time ago. A memory? Yes, a memory! A certain feel? A certain warmth? Between two people? The feel of embracing, the feel of kissing, the feel of love?  
真嗣感到有什么东西击中了他的心，几乎听到了他内心深处的回声。它以前如何？一些被召唤出来的东西，一些很久以前的东西。记忆？是的，一段回忆！某种感觉？某种温暖？两个人之间？拥抱的感觉，亲吻的感觉，爱的感觉？

Shinji's eyes darted towards a certain spot within the LCL fluid. Maybe it was simply the angel half of him speaking up, or it was something more human reacting to it, but this spot felt...unnatural almost.  
真嗣的目光飞向拼箱液体中的某个地方。也许这只是他一半的天使在说话，或者是一些更人性的反应，但这个地方感觉……几乎不自然。

Shinji paused in front of it, and ran a hand over the air. Nothing happened, but Shinji felt as though his hand had passed through something. Moving forward, and walked through what could only be described as a curtain of water. LCL fluid filled this entire space also, but in the center of it, floating unsupportably was-  
真嗣在它面前停了下来，伸出一只手在空中抚摸。什么都没发生，但真嗣感觉自己的手好像穿过了什么东西。继续往前走，走过了只能用水幕来形容的地方。拼箱液体也充满了整个空间，但在它的中央，却难以支撑地漂浮着——

"Asuka!" “飞鸟！”

Shinji moved forward, guided by his thoughts until he reached Asuka. He stretched out his hand, and caressed her face gently. She was unusually cold.  
真嗣在思绪的引导下向前移动，直到到达明日香面前。他伸出手，轻轻抚上她的脸。她异常冷漠。

"...Asuka," repeated Shinji. It felt like an eternity since he had seen her. But something was wrong. Her eyes were closed, and she wasn't moving.  
“……明日香，”真嗣重复道。自从见到她以来，他感觉就像过了一个世纪。但出了点问题。她的眼睛紧闭着，一动不动。

Without a second thought, Shinji projected his AT-field over her, and immediately noticed a change within her. Some of her memories had returned, some of which he had wished hadn't. He winced horribly and felt a low throb in his heart as he remembered his anger and rage over a certain event.  
真嗣不假思索地将AT力场投射到她身上，并立即注意到她体内的变化。她的一些记忆已经恢复，其中一些他希望没有。当他想起自己对某件事的愤怒和愤怒时，他猛地皱起眉头，心里一阵低沉的抽动。

But if she had remembered memories like that...  
但如果她还记得那样的记忆的话……

'You may not like the outcome.'  
“你可能不喜欢这个结果。”

Lilith's words echoed inside his head.  
莉莉丝的话在他脑海中回响。

If he didn't like the outcome, then he would just change it. Wasn't that what he had been doing for the longest time now after all?  
如果他不喜欢这个结果，那么他就会改变它。这不正是他已经做了很长时间的事了吗？

Shinji closed his eyes, and blended his AT-field with Asuka's. If any two people had tried this, it likely would not have worked. But since these two individuals were able to understand and love each other, it was able to work.  
真嗣闭上眼睛，将自己的AT力场与明日香的融合起来。如果任何两个人尝试过这一点，很可能都不会成功。但由于这两个人能够相互理解和相爱，所以它能够发挥作用。

Shinji slowly felt his mind start to fade as he entered into Asuka's thoughts. He only hoped that this decision was the right one.  
当真嗣进入明日香的思绪时，他慢慢地感觉到自己的思绪开始模糊。他只希望这个决定是正确的。

---

Shinji opened his eyes, taking several seconds to adjust to the light; everything was a whiteness that went on forever. Shinji stood up and looked down at his body, noticing that he was naked, but not caring that much.  
真嗣睁开了眼睛，花了几秒钟才适应了光线。一切都是一片白色，永远持续下去。真嗣站起来，低头看着自己的身体，发现他赤身裸体，但并没有太在意。

As he looked around he didn't see any defining features. He didn't even see Asuka in this emptiness. But she had to be here somewhere.  
当他环顾四周时，他没有看到任何明显的特征。在这片空虚中，他甚至没有看到明日香。但她必须在这儿的某个地方。

Shinji started moving forward, turning every which way as he went, searching for some sign of Asuka. Once or twice, he tried sending out his AT-field, but he supposed that was impractical right now.  
真嗣开始向前走，边走边转，寻找明日香的踪迹。有一两次，他尝试发出他的 AT 场，但他认为现在这是不切实际的。

'Just how big is this place exactly?' wondered Shinji.  
“这个地方到底有多大？”真嗣想知道。

As Shinji thought this, he saw something which made him rub his eyes, thinking he was tired. A bubble was floating along in the air, a bubble which was flashes images of himself. Shinji stared at this for a long while, watching it as it passed him. Shinji then turned towards the direction of where it had came from, and saw many other bubbles like it.  
正当真嗣这么想的时候，他看到了一些东西，让他揉了揉眼睛，以为自己累了。空气中漂浮着一个气泡，一个气泡中闪烁着他自己的影像。真嗣盯着它看了很久，看着它从他身边经过。真嗣转头看向它来的方向，看到了许多类似的气泡。

'Are these Asuka's memories?' thought Shinji.  
“这些是明日香的记忆吗？”真嗣想。

As Shinji rushed in the direction the memories came from, he noticed all of them had something to do with him, ones that Asuka should certainly have forgotten, yet here they were. Some of them Shinji had even forgotten himself, so he was surprised to see them. He had forgotten how different things were before he had gotten his angel powers. If things could only have stayed the same...  
当真嗣冲向记忆来源的方向时，他发现所有这些记忆都与他有关，明日香当然应该忘记的，但它们却在这里。其中一些真嗣甚至忘记了自己，所以他看到他们感到很惊讶。他已经忘记了在获得天使力量之前事情有多么不同。如果事情能保持不变就好了……

Shinji finally reached where the memories had congregated, and ran towards them, careful to dodge them as he went, afraid of popping them. As he neared the center, he saw a shape on the floor, completely different than that of the memories. The fiery hair of Asuka stood out particularly bright in the expanse of whiteness.  
真嗣终于到达了记忆聚集的地方，向他们跑去，边走边小心地躲开它们，生怕撞到它们。当他接近中心的时候，他看到地板上有一个与记忆中完全不同的形状。明日香火红的头发在一片白色中显得格外耀眼。

"Asuka!" shouted Shinji. “飞鸟！”真嗣喊道。

Asuka gave no sign that she heard him, but her head did turn slightly to its left, looking towards him.  
明日香没有表现出听到他说话的迹象，但她的头确实稍微向左转，看向他。

Shinji threw himself to the ground beside her, grabbing her shoulders and pulling her towards himself, cradling her in his arms, giving no sign that he cared that she also was naked. Even now she was unusually cold. Her skin was pale white, and her lips had a light purple tinge to them. But it was her eyes that scared Shinji. They were hazy, as though not really seeing anything.  
真嗣倒在她身旁的地上，抓住她的肩膀，将她拉向自己，将她搂在怀里，丝毫没有表现出他在意她也赤身裸体。即使现在，她也异常冷漠。她的皮肤白皙，嘴唇带着浅紫色。但真正让真嗣害怕的是她的眼睛。他们目光朦胧，仿佛什么也没看见。

"Asuka...c'mon Asuka...wake up..."  
“明日香……来吧，明日香……醒醒……”

Shinji stared down at her face. Her eyes were fixated on him, but Shinji knew that she wasn't really seeing him.  
真嗣低头看着她的脸。她的眼睛盯着他，但真嗣知道她并不是真的在看他。

"C'mon...this is a joke...right? Asuka!"  
“得了吧……这是个玩笑……对吗？明日香！”

Shinji yelled her name again, pressing his body against hers, trying to convey the feeling of warmth. He buried his face in her hair, running his hand along her bare back, trying to bring her back.  
真嗣再次喊着她的名字，将自己的身体压在她的身上，试图传达温暖的感觉。他把脸埋进她的头发里，用手抚摸着她光秃秃的后背，试图把她拉回来。

"Something...anything...Asuka please." Shinji started crying, his tears falling upon her face.  
“有事……有事……明日香拜托了。”真嗣开始哭泣，泪水落在她的脸上。

He never even got to tell her-  
他甚至都没来得及告诉她——

...shin... ...胫...

Shinji opened his tear strained eyes and looked down at her  
真嗣睁开泪眼，低头看着她

...shin...ji... ……申……吉……

Asuka opened and closed her mouth, her voice barely more than a whisper.  
明日香张开嘴又闭上，她的声音几乎只是耳语。

"Asuka!" “飞鸟！”

"Shin...ji? “新……吉？

"Asuka are you-" “明日香你是——”

"Shinji...listen..." mumbled Asuka.  
“真嗣……听着……”明日香咕哝道。

"Asuka don't say anything else, I-"  
“明日香别再说什么了，我——”

"I remembered everything...everything painful, everything wonderful..."  
“我记得一切……一切痛苦的事情，一切美好的事情……”

Shinji was silent as he held her, looking down at her face. She was speaking in a very low voice, her eyes still clouded over.  
真嗣沉默地抱着她，低头看着她的脸。她说话的声音很低，眼神依然阴沉。

"And Shinji...there was a lot of pain involved, but I'm still glad that I chose to remember you..."  
“而真嗣……虽然经历了很多痛苦，但我仍然很高兴我选择记住你……”

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

Asuka smiled, and cupped Shinji's face with one of her hands. "Idiot...don't cry like that."  
明日香微笑着，用一只手捧起真嗣的脸。 “笨蛋……别哭了。”

"But...you..." started Shinji.  
“但是……你……”真嗣开口道。

But Asuka placed her index finger against his lips, silencing him.  
但明日香将食指放在他的嘴唇上，让他闭嘴。

"Don't say anything, because this is difficult for me," said Asuka with a low sigh. I've just remembered countless things, many of which I'd rather not remember. So don't say anything right now...I'm still not feeling very well...but having you here is..."  
“别说什么，因为这对我来说很难。”明日香低声叹了口气说道。我刚刚想起了无数的事情，其中​​很多我宁愿不记得。所以现在什么都别说……我还是感觉不太舒服……但是有你在这里是……”

Asuka turned her face, pressing it against Shinji's chest.  
明日香转过脸，将脸贴在真嗣的胸口上。

"...better," she mumbled quietly.  
“……好多了。”她低声咕哝道。

Shinji stared down at Asuka's face pressed against his chest. Her body was slightly warmer now, and her eyes seemed to be regaining their normal clear blue color.  
真嗣低头看着明日香贴在自己胸口的脸。她的身体现在稍微暖和了，她的眼睛似乎也恢复了正常的清澈蓝色。

"Hmmm...okay," said Shinji as he rested his chin upon her head.  
“嗯……好吧，”真嗣把下巴靠在她的头上说道。

They stayed like that for an unforetold amount of time, and Shinji had nodded off several times while watching Asuka. After a long while though, Shinji felt himself being roused awake by something soft. As he slowly opened his eyes, his vision was completely taken up by Asuka who was sitting in front of him and lightly tapping his cheek.  
他们就这样呆了很长一段时间，真嗣看着明日香，好几次打瞌睡。过了好一会儿，真嗣感觉自己被某种柔软的东西惊醒了。当他缓缓睁开眼睛时，他的视线完全被坐在他面前轻轻拍着他脸颊的明日香占据。

"Shinji? You awake?" “真嗣？你醒了？”

"...Yeah...sorry..." “……是啊……抱歉……”

"No...don't be. You came to get me. Any longer and I probably would have faded completely."  
“不……别这样。你是来抓我的。再拖下去我可能就彻底消失了。”

"What happened to you? What were you like that? I thought that you had-"  
“你怎么了？你当时是什么样子？我以为你——”

"I remembered...certain things. They affected me heavily, probably always will. I almost shut myself out, simply because it was easier to do that have to remember the pain. Without you there Shinji, I wasn't able to continue. Any later and I would have-"  
“我记得……某些事情。它们对我影响很大，可能永远都会。我几乎把自己拒之门外，只是因为记住痛苦更容易做到。没有你在，真嗣，我无法继续下去再晚一点，我就会——”

"Don't say that, I don't want to think about that," said Shinji as he shook his head.  
“别这么说，我不想考虑这个。”真嗣摇摇头说道。

"Thank you," said Asuka wearily.  
“谢谢你。”明日香疲倦地说。

"Are you okay?" asked Shinji.  
“你还好吗？”真嗣问道。

"Yes..and no," said Asuka. "Everything hurts, but I am at the same time happy that I could see you, which makes me have to ask, where are we exactly?"  
“是的……也不是，”明日香说。 “一切都很痛苦，但我同时很高兴能见到你，这让我不得不问，我们到底在哪里？”

"In the Black Egg of Lilith I suppose," said Shinji.  
“我想是在莉莉丝的黑蛋里。”真嗣说道。

"So then, this is Third Impact? Are we in the middle of Instrumentality?"  
“那么，这是第三次冲击吗？我们正处于工具性之中吗？”

"We were, but I talked to Lilith, and we reached an understanding. Its really thanks to Lilith and Rei that I was able to find you."  
“是的，但是我和莉莉丝谈过，我们达成了谅解。真的多亏了莉莉丝和丽，我才能够找到你们。”

Asuka was silent however, her face expressionless.  
然而明日香却沉默不语，面无表情。

"Are you angry at her, for killing you?" asked Shinji eventually.  
“你因为她杀了你而生她的气吗？”真嗣最终问道。

"I am, but I can still feel the pain of dying..."  
“是啊，但我还是能感受到死亡的痛苦……”

"Don't worry, it will pass," Shinji assured her.  
“别担心，一切都会过去的。”真嗣向她保证。

"...I...hope so," sighed Asuka.  
“……我……希望如此，”明日香叹息道。

Shinji looked down at her face, surprised at how worn it seemed. Even though Asuka was only fifteen, she seemed to have aged exponentially during her time in here.  
真嗣低头看着她的脸，惊讶地发现她的脸是如此憔悴。尽管明日香只有十五岁，但在这里的这段时间里，她似乎苍老了很多。

"How are you feeling?" Shinji asked her.  
“你感觉怎么样？”真嗣问她。

"Better I suppose, though still very tired. My mind is a whirl of things, and I'm having trouble keeping track of the different memories. Its like, a different me existed in the memories from before; I'm having trouble coming to terms with that. And yourself also...you were also very different."  
“我想好多了，虽然还是很累。我的脑子里乱七八糟，我很难记住不同的记忆。就像，记忆中存在着一个与以前不同的我；我很难恢复过来。”就这一点而言，你自己也很不同。”

"I know..." mumbled Shinji.  
“我知道……”真嗣咕哝道。

"Why did you do it Shinji? Why didn't you just tell me flat out that we had loved each other? Even at the end, you still lied to me about us, saying that we were only friends."  
“你为什么要这么做，真嗣？你为什么不直接告诉我我们彼此相爱？甚至到了最后，你仍然对我们撒谎，说我们只是朋友。”

Shinji had hoped that she wouldn't bring this up, but he didn't have any way of evading the question.  
真嗣本来希望她不要提起这件事，但他却没有办法回避这个问题。

"I told you before about my visions and how I was able to see possibilities of the future involved with the people around me. You were always at the forefront of my mind, and I tried denying that by rejecting what I felt. I sealed off my own emotions after you lost your memories, but that didn't work of course. I still remembered things, even if they were very vague. I knew what had happened once, and knew that it could happen again. I couldn't let anything happen to you however, and promised myself that I would do everything in my power to prevent you from entering an Evangelion again. But you proved too stubborn, and surprised me again and again."  
“我之前告诉过你我的愿景，以及我如何能够看到与周围的人有关的未来的可能性。你总是在我的脑海中，我试图通过拒绝我的感受来否认这一点。我封锁了你失去记忆后我自己的情绪，但这当然不起作用，即使它们非常模糊，我知道曾经发生过什么，并且知道它可能会再次发生。不管你发生什么事情，我都向自己保证，我会尽一切努力阻止你再次进入新世纪福音战士，但事实证明你太固执了，一次又一次让我感到惊讶。”

Asuka stared back at him, her face mere inches away from his. Looking down at his chest, she rest her head against it and spoke softly.  
明日香回望着他，她的脸距离他的脸只有几英寸。低头看着他的胸口，她把头靠在他的胸口上，轻声说道。

"The feeling had always been there as you said, but it always hurt...just seeing you hurt sometimes. And those earrings...that day confuses me, but I still understand what had happened, and yet, everything was snatched away afterwards."  
“就像你说的，这种感觉一直都在，但总是很痛……只是有时看到你受伤。还有那些耳环……那天让我很困惑，但我仍然明白发生了什么，然而，一切都被夺走了。”然后。”

"It was," Shinji nodded. “是的。”真嗣点点头。

Asuka was silent now, her face still pressed against Shinji's chest, not carrying that hers and his bodies were so entwined with each other.  
明日香现在沉默了，她的脸仍然贴在真嗣的胸口上，没有意识到她和他的身体如此纠缠在一起。

"What...will we do now?" asked Asuka.  
“我们……现在做什么？”明日香问道。

"Lilith promised me something," said Shinji after a few seconds. "I don't know what it is, but if it can get rid of your pain..."  
“莉莉丝答应了我一件事。”几秒钟后真嗣说道。 “我不知道那是什么，但如果它能解除你的痛苦的话……”

"That would be nice," sighed Asuka.  
“那就太好了，”明日香叹息道。

Shinji smiled slightly, and wrapped his arms around her back, running his hands along it, pausing at the groves and tracing a line. Asuka shivered slightly at his touch, but let him continue on as he pleased. She didn't care that they were both naked right now, she only cared about this feeling that was running through her right now. But she was afraid that if Shinji let go, the pain of her memories would overtake her again.  
真嗣微微一笑，用双臂搂住她的背，用手抚过她的背，在树林处停下来，画出一条线。明日香在他的触碰下微微颤抖，但还是让他继续说下去。她不在乎他们现在都赤身裸体，她只在乎此刻流淌在她身上的这种感觉。但她害怕，如果真嗣放手，记忆中的痛苦会再次降临到她身上。

"Hey Shinji..." “喂，慎二……”

"Hmmm?" “嗯？”

"Do you still love me?"  
“你还爱我吗？”

Her question caught him off guard, and he paused with the stroking of her back. Did he still love Asuka? He always told himself that he did, but sometimes he didn't rightfully understand what love was, or if this was how it was supposed to feel.  
她的问题让他措手不及，他停了下来，抚摸着她的背。他还爱明日香吗？他总是告诉自己他做到了，但有时他并没有正确理解爱是什么，或者这是否应该是这样的感觉。

"I do," said Shinji slowly. "Though I don't understand it myself..."  
“我愿意。”真嗣缓缓说道。 “虽然我自己也不太明白……”

Asuka looked up at Shinji, a frown on her face.  
明日香抬头看着真嗣，脸上皱起了眉头。

"Do you really have to understand it?" wondered Asuka.  
“你真的必须明白吗？”明日香想知道。

"Huh?" “嗯？”

Letting out a low sigh, Asuka's breath tickled Shinji's chest, making him squirm. Asuka smiled slightly at this and said, "Love isn't something easily understood in the first place, something which I've realized recently. But if being around somebody makes you happy, shouldn't that be enough?"  
明日香低低地叹了口气，呼吸喷在真嗣的胸口，让他浑身蠕动。明日香闻言微微一笑，说道：“爱情本来就不是一件容易理解的事情，我最近才意识到这一点。但如果有人在身边能让你快乐，那不就足够了吗？”

Shinji looked at Asuka's face, feelings and emotions running through him which he had forgotten. Asuka was...had always been, somebody important to him, somebody that could never be replaced. If this was love...then-  
真嗣看着明日香的脸，他已经忘记了他的感受和情绪。明日香是……一直都是，一个对他来说很重要的人，一个永远无法取代的人。如果这就是爱……那么——

Shinji wrapped his arms around Asuka's back, and pulled her towards him, resting his forehead against hers as he did so. Asuka smiled slightly as she closed her eyes, enjoying the feel of closeness that radiated from herself and Shinji.  
真嗣用双臂搂住明日香的背，将她拉向自己，同时将额头抵在她的额头上。明日香微微一笑，闭上眼睛，享受着自己和真嗣散发出的亲密感。

"Hey Shinji...would it be selfish of me to do something?" asked Asuka quietly.  
“嘿，真嗣……我这样做会不会很自私？”明日香轻声问道。

Shinji opened his eyes and looked at her. Her eyes were open as well as she stared back at him; they were incredibly clear.  
真嗣睁开眼睛，看着她。她的眼睛睁着，也盯着他。他们非常清楚。

Shinji shook his head softly.  
慎二轻轻摇了摇头。

"Okay," mumbled Asuka as she leaned into him, pressing her breasts against his chest as she kissed him. Though momentarily caught off guard, Shinji let his own emotions take hold, and kissed Asuka back, projecting his love of her through the kiss.  
“好吧，”明日香低声说道，她靠向他，将乳房贴在他的胸前，亲吻他。尽管一时措手不及，真嗣还是控制住了自己的情绪，回吻了明日香，通过这个吻表达了他对她的爱。

They broke apart shortly, and stared back at each other. It had been painful, but they had been able to overcome that pain.  
很快他们就分开了，互相对视着。这很痛苦，但他们能够克服这种痛苦。

"Hey Shinji," mumbled Asuka as she cupped his face in her hands.  
“嘿真嗣，”明日香用手捧着他的脸，咕哝道。

"Yeah..." nodded Shinji. “嗯……”慎二点头。

Asuka leaned forward, and kissed him again, her lips overlapping with his, her warmth meshing with his. Shinji placed his arms behind her bare back, running his hands along it. Asuka shivered at his touch again, but continued kissing him. She wanted this, even if they forgot it. She wanted to feel Shinji like this at least once. The future was uncertain, so she wanted to enjoy this moment without worry about what was to come.  
明日香倾身向前，再次吻了他，她的嘴唇与他的嘴唇重叠，她的温暖与他的交融。真嗣将双臂放在她赤裸的背后，抚摸着她的背。明日香因他的触碰再次颤抖，但仍继续亲吻他。她想要这个，即使他们忘记了。她想至少有一次真嗣这样的感觉。未来是不确定的，所以她想享受这一刻，而不用担心即将发生的事情。

Asuka broke the kiss off first, and looked away from Shinji. Her cheeks were slightly pink, but looking out of the corner of her eye, she saw that Shinji's as well were pink. She chuckled a little at that.  
明日香率先结束了这个吻，并把目光从真嗣身上移开。她的脸颊微微泛着粉红色，但她用眼角的余光看到真嗣的脸颊也是粉红色的。说到这里她轻笑了一声。

'We are only fifteen years old after all,' thought Asuka. Hopefully though, there would be many more moments like this to come.  
“我们毕竟才十五岁，”明日香想。但希望以后还会有更多这样的时刻。

"...Asuka...uhh..." stuttered Shinji  
“……明日香……呃……”真嗣结结巴巴地说

"Hmmm?" asked Asuka with a raised eyebrow, regaining some of her flare.  
“嗯？”明日香扬起眉毛问道，她的怒火又恢复了一些。

"Sorry...just surprised is all."  
“抱歉……只是惊讶而已。”

"I told you it was selfish," said Asuka as she stood up and threw her arms above her head, stretching her body. Now that they weren't so close, Shinji wasn't able to look at her. Partly because Asuka was still naked, but partly because he was still embarrassed over what had happened.  
“我告诉过你这是自私的，”明日香站起来，将双臂举过头顶，伸展身体。现在距离不再那么近，真嗣无法看她。部分是因为明日香仍然赤身裸体，但部分是因为他仍然对所发生的事情感到尴尬。

"Is this still inside the Black Egg though?" asked Asuka as she looked around.  
“这还在黑蛋里面吗？”明日香环顾四周问道。

"Yes...but this is inside your mind," said Shinji as she sat up, his eyes still looking at the ground.  
“是的……但这是在你的脑海里，”真嗣坐起身说道，他的眼睛仍然看着地面。

"How are you here exactly then?"  
“那你怎么在这里？”

"AT-field," said Shinji simply.  
“AT-field，”真嗣简单地说。

"Then how exactly are we supposed to get out?"  
“那我们到底该怎么出去呢？”

"That would be your doing I'm guessing," said Shinji.  
“我猜那是你干的，”真嗣说。

Asuka looked over at him, and frowned, annoyed that he wasn't looking at her. All right, yes this was highly embarrassing, and yes they were both naked, but hadn't they both basically said they still loved each other?  
明日香看着他，皱起眉头，因为他没有看她而生气。好吧，是的，这非常尴尬，是的，他们都赤身裸体，但他们不是基本上都说他们仍然爱着对方吗？

"Well...I'll try," said Asuka.  
“嗯……我会尽力的，”明日香说道。

Asuka closed her eyes then and searched for her body within the sea of LCL fluid. It was difficult at first, but Asuka knowing who she was, found her body relatively quickly. That and the fact it was sectioned off from everybody else.  
明日香闭上眼睛，在拼箱液的海洋中寻找着自己的身体。一开始很难，但明日香知道她是谁，很快就找到了她的身体。事实是它与其他人隔离开来。

"Did you find it?" asked Shinji. He felt the plane they were in suddenly lose some of its foundation.  
“你找到了吗？”真嗣问道。他感觉他们所在的位面突然失去了一些根基。

"Yeah, I did," said Asuka as she walked over to him and held a hand out. Shinji wordlessly took it, still trying not to look directly at her.  
“是的，我做到了，”明日香走到他身边并伸出一只手说道。真嗣一言不发地接过它，仍然试图不直视她。

"See above then," said Asuka with a small smile.  
“那就看上面吧。”明日香微笑着说道。

"Yeah..." mumbled Shinji.  
“是啊……”真嗣咕哝道。

The white walls around them shattered, and darkness engulfed the two of them. At first, Shinji was surprised by this, but saw Asuka unaffected by it, and assumed everything was okay.  
周围的白色墙壁破碎，黑暗吞没了两人。起初，真嗣对此感到惊讶，但看到明日香没有受到影响，并认为一切都很好。

Shinji opened his eyes within the sea of orange LCL fluid and looked quickly down at the girl next to him. After several seconds, Asuka opened her eyes slowly, blinking as she looked up at Shinji.  
真嗣在橙色的拼箱液体海洋中睁开了眼睛，迅速低头看着身旁的女孩。几秒钟后，明日香缓缓睁开眼睛，眨着眼睛抬头看着真嗣。

"Is this it?" asked Asuka as she sat up.  
“是这个吗？”明日香坐起来问道。

"It is..." said Shinji. “这是……”真嗣说道。

"I'm starting to wish I stayed in there."  
“我开始希望我能呆在那里。”

Shinji didn't appreciate the joke. Asuka however looked down at her body, and quickly covered it; she was still naked. Darting her gaze towards Shinji, she looked at him annoyingly, since he still had clothes on.  
真嗣不喜欢这个玩笑。明日香却低头看了看自己的身体，赶紧捂住了自己的身体。她仍然赤身裸体。她的目光投向真嗣，恼怒地看着他，因为他还穿着衣服。

"How come I'm naked and you're not?"  
“为什么我是裸体的，而你却不是？”

"Probably because I came from the outside," said Shinji. "And you seemed fine before."  
“可能是因为我是从外面来的吧。”真嗣说道。 “而且你之前看起来还不错。”

'Because you were naked also,' thought Asuka wordlessly.  
“因为你也赤身裸体。”明日香无言地想。

"Well...whatever. Lets get out of there. I want to see Lilith-"  
“好吧……无论如何。我们离开那里吧。我想见莉莉丝——”

Pain hit Asuka's heart as her memories caught up with her. Flashes of everything seared her mind so that she was forced to clutch her head in agony.  
当她的记忆追上她时，明日香的心感到疼痛。眼前的一切一幕幕闪过，让她的心灼痛不已，她不得不痛苦地抱住头。

"Asuka!" shouted Shinji. “飞鸟！”真嗣喊道。

Rushing to her side, he gripped her shoulders and held her against his chest. She was shaking uncontrollably.  
他冲到她身边，抓住她的肩膀，将她按在自己的胸前。她无法控制地颤抖着。

"Shinji...it hurts," Asuka groaned as tears started leaking from her eyes.  
“真嗣……好痛。”明日香呻吟着，泪水从她的眼中流淌出来。

'Damn it,' thought Shinji. Asuka's mind still wasn't able to cope with the new memories. Everything contradicted everything else so that she didn't know what was right anymore. And the rape...Shinji knew this is what tormented Asuka the most. Having to remember the feeling of it must have been too terrible.  
“该死，”真嗣想。明日香的大脑仍然无法应对新的记忆。一切都互相矛盾，让她不知道什么才是正确的。还有强奸……真嗣知道这才是最让明日香痛苦的事情。必须记住那种感觉一定太可怕了。

'But Lilith should be able to help,' Shinji told himself.  
“但是莉莉丝应该能够帮忙，”真嗣告诉自己。

"C'mon on Asuka. I'll guide you out."  
“来吧明日香。我带你出去。”

Asuka sniffed slightly and pressed her head against Shinji's chest, uncaring now that she was naked.  
明日香轻轻吸了吸鼻子，把头靠在真嗣的胸口上，毫不在意她赤身裸体。

Shinji continued moving forward through the stream of LCL fluid, carrying Asuka in his arms as he went, holding onto her dearly. Asuka was silent, but she was still shaking in Shinji's arms. Shinji didn't know what he was supposed to say to her, or how to even comfort her right now. He could try to alter her memories with his AT-field he supposed, but nothing good would likely come of that.  
真嗣继续在拼箱液流中前进，边走边抱着明日香，紧紧地抱住她。明日香沉默了，但她在真嗣的怀里仍然颤抖着。真嗣现在不知道自己该对她说什么，甚至不知道该如何安慰她。他认为他可以尝试用他的 AT 场改变她的记忆，但这样做不太可能有什么好处。

No, it was only Lilith that he could rely on right now.  
不，现在他能依靠的只有莉莉丝。

---

After what felt like hours, Shinji finally broke free of the Black Egg. The last stretch had surprised him however, as nobody tried to impede them. He suspected that Lilith might have had something to do with this.  
过了好几个小时，真嗣终于挣脱了黑蛋。然而最后一段让他感到惊讶，因为没有人试图阻止他们。他怀疑这件事可能与莉莉丝有关。

His body was of course still resting inside Unit 01, providing the equation to Third Impact, so this was where he was transported to after he broke free of the Egg. He felt his mind slowly float down into his body, but only one thing was missing.  
当然，他的身体仍在01号单元内，为第三次冲击提供了方程式，所以这就是他挣脱蛋后被传送到的地方。他感觉自己的神识慢慢飘落到体内，却唯独少了一样东西。

"Asuka?" asked Shinji. “明日香？”真嗣问道。

She had returned there with him. But he had been sure that she had been with him when he-  
她和他一起回到了那里。但他确信她一直在他身边，当他——

"I have her here with me Shinji," came Lilith's voice from around him.  
“我让她和我在一起，真嗣，”莉莉丝的声音从他身边传来。

"Lilith, if you do anything to harm Asuka, I swear."  
“莉莉丝，如果你做了任何伤害明日香的事，我发誓。”

"Relax, I wont harm her in any way. I just want to talk with you for now, about what happens now. I've put her mind at rest momentarily so she doesn't have to deal with the pain however."  
“放心，我不会以任何方式伤害她。我现在只想和你谈谈，谈谈现在发生的事情。我已经让她暂时安息了，这样她就不用承受痛苦了。”

"Fine, I'm coming over," said Shinji.  
“好吧，我这就过去。”真嗣说道。

Leaving his mind, he traveled to the Garden of Eden, and felt his feet slam down on the white soil there. He was standing in front of the Tree of Life. He stared at it for several seconds, looking at its withered state before he turned towards the two people beside it. Asuka was laying on the ground, breathing deeply as she rested. Shinji almost wished that things could stay like that forever, that Asuka wouldn't have to feel anymore pain. But such a thing was impossible.  
他抛开思绪，来到了伊甸园，感觉自己的脚踩在了那里的白色泥土上。他站在生命之树前。他盯着它看了几秒，看着它枯萎的样子，这才转向旁边的两人。明日香躺在地上，深呼吸着休息。真嗣几乎希望事情能永远这样下去，明日香再也不用感到痛苦了。但这样的事是不可能的。

Turning towards the person beside her, he looked at Lilith for a few seconds. She was looking down at Asuka with a curious expression on her face, something which reminded Shinji of Rei momentarily.  
他转头看向身边的人，看了莉莉丝几秒。她低头看着明日香，脸上带着好奇的表情，这让真嗣瞬间想起了丽。

"You found her," said Lilith simply.  
“你找到了她，”莉莉丝简单地说。

"There was never a moment when I didn't think I would," said Shinji.  
“我从来没有想过我会这么做，”真嗣说。

Lilith turned towards him and said, "But you were also a bit late. She remember things that her already weakened mind was not able to take, and without you there, she faded away. Though she is sleeping peacefully now, if she were to wake up, that pain would still be there."  
莉莉丝转头看向他，道：“不过你也来晚了一些，她已经记不清了，她本就虚弱的心智无法承受，没有你在，她就渐渐消失了。虽然她现在睡得很安稳，但如果她醒醒吧，疼痛依然存在。”

"But you said there was something you could do."  
“但你说过你可以做点什么。”

"I did, but I must first ask you Shinji about the circumstances of which you will be thrown in. I told you already that the world will be as it is for several years until the planet starts to regrow. If humans leave things untouched for a time, it will speed up the process. Not every human will return of course, some desiring the false reality, and they can become enamored in it for all I care. That is there decision. But humans will return nonetheless."  
“是的，但我必须先问你，真嗣，你将被扔进什么样的环境。我已经告诉过你，世界将在数年之内保持原样，直到地球开始重新生长。如果人类不去碰触一切，当然，并不是每个人都会回归，有些人渴望虚假的现实，他们可能会迷恋它，但这就是我所关心的决定，但人类仍然会回归。”

"As for you and Asuka...it seems impossible to separate you. Whether you have your memories in tact or not, you two still sot each other out. I don't believe it is a thing that can be prevented, but I can alleviate your pain to some degree, as I am partially to blame because of that pain."  
“至于你和明日香……似乎不可能分开。无论你们的记忆是否完整，你们两个人还是在互相较量。我不认为这是可以阻止的事情，但我可以在某种程度上减轻你的痛苦，因为我对这种痛苦负有部分责任。”

"Shinji, as you know, Adam created the bodies of you humans, and I created your AT-field, everything that incorporates a person. There personality, thoughts, and memories, they all make up who a person is. The angels each had a power, and Adam and myself being the forerunners had powers of creation. I created things more abstract, while Adam created things more physical. The AT-fields are an example of this. They are impossible to see or feel by normal humans, but they exist nonetheless."  
“真嗣，如你所知，亚当创造了你们人类的身体，而我创造了你们的 AT 场，以及包含一个人的一切。有个性、思想和记忆，它们都构成了一个人。每个天使都有亚当和我自己是先驱者，我创造了更抽象的事物，而亚当创造了更物理的事物，AT 场就是一个例子，它们是普通人无法看到或感觉到的。尽管如此，它们仍然存在。”

"Shinji...though you and Asuka love each other, you both unknowingly hurt each other and were hurt by the things around you, and this is no more apparent then with what Asuka is dealing with right now. If she had never met you, would she ever have experience those things? The same for you; if you had never met Asuka, would you ever have discovered your angel powers and the fact that you are Adam's son? All these things hurt you however, even if they are the truth, for the truth usually hurts."  
“真嗣……虽然你和明日香彼此相爱，但你们都在不知不觉中互相伤害，并被周围的事物所伤害，而这一点在明日香现在所面对的情况下就更不明显了。如果她从未见过你的话，她会经历这些事情吗？如果你从未见过明日香，你会发现你的天使力量和你是亚当的儿子这一事实，即使它们是亚当的儿子？真相，因为真相通常会带来伤害。”

"I'm sorry for everything that I've done, and as I said, I am partially to blame. I showed you how to control your powers, I nudged you along the way, hoping that things would fall into place as they did. But still, you rejected me, you rejected Instrumentality, you rejected the false reality, all for the girl that you love, even though you were uncertain about that love. That girl replied in turn, loving you as you loved her. But the pain of everything will still exist, even with that love there."  
“我对我所做的一切感到抱歉，正如我所说，我也有部分责任。我向你展示了如何控制你的力量，我一路上推动着你，希望事情能像他们所做的那样顺利进行。但你仍然拒绝了我，你拒绝了工具性，你拒绝了虚假的现实，这一切都是为了你所爱的女孩，尽管你不确定那个女孩反过来爱你，就像你爱她一样。即使有那样的爱，一切的痛苦仍然存在。”

"I've decided that I'll help you and Asuka in this regard however, and erase all your memories of each other."  
“不过，我决定在这方面帮助你们和明日香，并抹去你们关于彼此的所有记忆。”

Shinji was silent, thinking that he had heard wrong. Erase there memories of each other? Something like that was...but he cherished those memories he had of Asuka. He didn't want to lose them!  
真嗣沉默了，以为自己听错了。抹去彼此的记忆？类似的事情是……但他很珍惜与明日香有关的那些回忆。他不想失去他们！

"Lilith...that is-" 「莉莉丝……那是——」

"Something which you can't agree with?" asked Lilith.  
“有什么事情你不能同意吗？”莉莉丝问道。

"Of course! I just got Asuka back, and now you say that we should just forget about each other completely? Bullshit!"  
“当然！我刚把明日香带回来，你却说我们应该彻底忘记对方？胡扯！”

"Shinji, think about it this way. Those memories will forever be ingrained in your mind. You are strong, and that is largely thanks to your angel prowess, but Asuka is still human, and having memories from two completely separate moments in her life will torment her until she wont know which one is truly her."  
“真嗣，这样想吧。那些记忆将永远在你的脑海中根深蒂固。你很坚强，这很大程度上要归功于你的天使力量，但明日香仍然是人类，她拥有生命中两个完全不同时刻的记忆会折磨她，直到她分不清哪个才是真正的她。”

"But-" “但-”

"This is all I can do Shinji. It is the only way to take care of Asuka's pain. And you yourself are in pain, even if you don't want to admit it. You locked many things away inside you, but if those were to spill forth suddenly, your rage and anger may break people dear to you. Do you want that?"  
“这就是真嗣所能做的一切。这是解决明日香痛苦的唯一方法。而你自己也很痛苦，即使你不想承认。你把很多东西锁在心里，但如果那些东西如果突然爆发，你的愤怒和愤怒可能会伤害你所爱的人，你愿意吗？”

"No, but-" “不是，但-”

Lilith shook her head and looked down at Asuka.  
莉莉丝摇摇头，低头看着明日香。

"I spoke to her briefly before you arrived here, and told her about my offer. She, like you was hesitant, but I think she believed as I do that even if your memories of each other no longer exist, the love for each other will still remain. Memories may disappear and fade, but the body remembers a person important to it. You and Asuka connected on a level few humans are able to, and even though you are both at such a young age, you were both able to recognize each for who they were. Many humans, and even couples are unable to do this, and don't understand what the other is really thinking. But you and Asuka aren't like that."  
“在你到达这里之前，我和她简短地交谈过，告诉她我的提议。她和你一样犹豫不决，但我想她和我一样相信，即使你们彼此的记忆不再存在，对彼此的爱仍然存在。”记忆可能会消失和褪色，但身体会记住一个对它来说很重要的人，而你和明日香的联系程度是人类无法企及的，尽管你们都那么年轻，但你们都能够做到。许多人类，甚至情侣都做不到这一点，也不明白对方的真实想法，但你和明日香不是这样的。”

"So then...she agreed to it?"  
“那么……她就同意了？”

"Only if you do," replied Lilith. "Ultimately, it has to be both your decisions."  
“只要你愿意，”莉莉丝回答道。 “最终，这必须是你们两个的决定。”

Shinji's eyes moved towards Asuka momentarily gazing at her longingly.  
真嗣的目光移向明日香，一时充满渴望地注视着她。

"Lilith...if I agree to this...what about the other humans. What will happen to them?"  
“莉莉丝……如果我同意了……其他人类呢？他们会怎么样？”

Lilith paused for a brief second and thought about this.  
莉莉丝停顿了一下，思考了这个问题。

"For a time, I shall keep them within the Black Egg until I deem the time ready for the Lilim's rebirth. During that time, you and Asuka will be able to live alone, free from any turmoil. I can give you several years to grow with each other."  
“我会把他们暂时留在黑蛋里，直到我认为莉莉姆重生的时机已经成熟。在那段时间里，你和明日香将能够单独生活，不受任何动乱。我可以给你几年的时间。互相成长。”

"And what of my angel powers? Can you do anything about those?"  
“那我的天使力量呢？你能做点什么吗？”

Lilith's face fell slightly, as she remembered the conversation she had had with Rei.  
想起和雷的对话，莉莉丝的脸色微微沉了下来。

"Unfortunately Shinji, I can't do anything about that, nor could Adam even. You born from Adam and human, and were given the powers of an angel. I don't have any say in the matter. You are you are and will forever be. Even if you memories are gone, that part of you still remains."  
“不幸的是，真嗣，我对此无能为力，甚至亚当也无能为力。你是亚当和人类所生，并被赋予了天使的力量。我在这件事上没有任何发言权。你是你是，即使你的记忆消失了，那部分的你仍然存在。”

"...I see," said Shinji. “……我明白了，”真嗣说道。

Lilith watched Shinji, wondering if she should voice her opinion on the subject, but her and Rei had already talked about that. It wasn't there place to interfere.  
莉莉丝看着真嗣，想知道她是否应该就这个话题发表自己的看法，但她和丽已经谈过了。没有地方可以干涉。

"Then you agree to this?" asked Lilith.  
“那你同意这个吗？”莉莉丝问道。

Shinji once again looked over Asuka; he nodded his head slowly.  
真嗣再次看向明日香。他缓缓地点点头。

"Okay," said Lilith. “好吧，”莉莉丝说。

Standing up, she walked over to Shinji and placed a hand of hers on his head.  
她站起来，走到真嗣身边，将一只手放在他的头上。

"One last thing Lilith...what will you do after this? What will you and Ayanami do?"  
「莉莉丝最后一件事……之后你会做什么？你和绫波会做什么？」

"...I thought about your words, and have decided to search for Adam. He's out there somewhere, and seeing you and Asuka reminded me of times I'd all but forgotten. I'll hold onto the hope that we can become one again. But for the time being, I'll watch over the earth until the Lilim return. Afterwards...well, I'll worry about that when the time comes."  
“......我考虑了你的话，并决定寻找亚当。他就在外面的某个地方，看到你和明日香让我想起了我几乎忘记的那些时光。我会坚持希望我们能够成为但暂时，我会守护地球直到莉莉姆回来……好吧，到时候我会担心的。”

Lilith smiled slightly at Shinji, who couldn't help but smile back.  
莉莉丝对真嗣微微一笑，真嗣也忍不住笑了笑。

"Its been enjoyable seeing you grow into the person you are today," said Lilith. "I wish you and Asuka all the best."  
“看到你成长为今天的样子，我很高兴，”莉莉丝说。 “祝你和明日香一切顺利。”

Lilith then lightly tapped Shinji on the forehead, and whiteness immediately engulfed his mind.  
莉莉丝轻轻拍了拍真嗣的额头，真嗣的脑海立刻一片惨白。

---

At first, Shinji thought that he was inside Asuka's mind again, but as he noticed, things were slightly different. Though everything was white, there was a distinct outline of a wooden bench in the middle of the plane.  
起初，真嗣以为自己又进入了明日香的脑海，但当他注意到时，情况略有不同。虽然一切都是白色的，但飞机的正中央却有着清晰的木凳轮廓。

As Shinji started walking towards it, he felt a light tap on the back of his shoulder and jumped immensely. Spinning around, he saw Asuka standing there, a wide grin on her face. She was wearing her plug suit, and looking down at himself, Shinji noticed that he was wearing his as well.  
当真嗣开始朝它走去时，他感到肩膀后面被轻轻拍了一下，然后跳了起来。转过身来，他看到明日香站在那里，脸上挂着灿烂的笑容。她穿着她的紧身衣，低头看着自己，真嗣发现他也穿着他的。

"Jump easily, don't you?" laughed Asuka as she teased him.  
“跳起来很轻松，不是吗？”明日香嘲笑他时笑道。

"What was that for?" “那是干什么用的？”

"Just felt like it," said Asuka as she walked past him. Sitting down on the bench, she patted the spot beside her, indicating that she wanted him to sit next to her. Shinji did so, glancing sideways at her as she did so. Asuka threw her hands behind the bench and stretched her feet out.  
“只是感觉就像这样，”明日香从他身边走过时说道。坐在长凳上，她拍了拍身边的位置，示意他坐到自己身边。真嗣这样做了，同时侧眼看了她一眼。明日香把手放到长凳后面，伸出双脚。

"Ah, it feels good to be wearing a plug suit again."  
“啊，又穿上插头套装了，感觉真好。”

"Says you," mumbled Shinji.  
“你说。”真嗣咕哝道。

"You never did enjoy using the Evangelions."  
“你从来都不喜欢使用新世纪福音战士。”

"And you did?" “你做到了？”

"Well, it was always someplace I could go...and Mama was there of course," said Asuka. "Though of course, meeting you messed that up completely."  
“嗯，总有一个我可以去的地方……当然，妈妈也在那儿，”明日香说。 “当然，遇见你让事情完全搞砸了。”

"Do you regret that?" “你后悔吗？”

"Not at all," said Asuka as she turned and looked at Shinji. "Meeting you was the best thing that has ever happened to me."  
“一点也不。”明日香转身看着真嗣说道。 “遇见你是我这辈子发生过的最好的事情。”

Shinji stared back at her, amazed that she had said such words.  
真嗣回头看着她，很惊讶她会说出这样的话。

"I mean, who else is always going to cook my meals," laughed Asuka.  
“我的意思是，还有谁会一直给我做饭呢？”明日香笑着说。

Shinji sighed; he should have known better than to expected anything else.  
真嗣叹了口气；他应该比预期更清楚地知道其他事情。

But all too suddenly, Asuka's head tilted sideways onto Shinji's shoulder.  
但突然间，明日香的头侧向真嗣的肩膀。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

"...Will you hold me Shinji?" Asuka whispered through half closed lips.  
「……你能抱抱我吗？」明日香半闭着嘴唇低声说道。

Shinji did so, wrapping an arm around Asuka's shoulder and pulling her close to himself. He then rest his chin on the top of her head and nuzzled it against her silky hair.  
真嗣这样做了，用一只手臂搂住明日香的肩膀，将她拉近自己。然后他将下巴抵在她的头顶上，用鼻子蹭着她柔滑的头发。

"Shinji...I'm scared about the future. Did we make the right decision?"  
“真嗣……我对未来感到害怕。我们做出了正确的决定吗？”

Shinji looked down at Asuka, and saw her eyes wide with fear. He didn't want such an emotion to ever pass through her once again. So-  
真嗣低头看着明日香，看到她的眼睛里充满了恐惧。他不想让这样的情绪再次在她身上流过。所以-

"The pain will be gone," said Shinji as he brushed his lips against her hair.  
“疼痛会消失的，”真嗣一边说，一边用嘴唇拂过她的头发。

"But will we be...will we be able to love each other again?"  
“但是我们……我们还能再次相爱吗？”

Shinji drew his head away from her. Resting his hand on her chin, he tilted her chin upwards so that she was looking at him.  
真嗣把头从她身上移开。他把手放在她的下巴上，抬起她的下巴，让她看着他。

"For us, such a thing is always possible."  
“对我们来说，这样的事情总是有可能的。”

Shinji then leaned down and kissed Asuka sweetly. Even if he forgot, it didn't matter. He wanted this to be the last thing they remembered together.  
真嗣俯下身子，甜蜜地吻住了明日香。就算他忘记了，也没关系。他希望这是他们一起记得的最后一件事。

As Shinji and Asuka broke apart, a bright light from somewhere in the far distance shot outward. Shinji noticed the space they were in start to disappear, almost like when he had left Asuka's mind. But it was fading away, almost like a millions feathers floating in the wind.  
当真嗣和明日香分开时，一道明亮的光芒从远处的某处射出。真嗣注意到他们所在的空间开始消失，就像他离开明日香的脑海一样。但它正在消失，几乎就像数百万根羽毛在风中飘扬。

Shinji wrapped his arms around Asuka then, hugging her tightly. If things were gonna disappear like this, he wanted them to be-  
真嗣伸手搂住明日香，紧紧地拥抱着她。如果事情就这样消失，他希望它们——

"Huh?" “嗯？”

Shinji sat alone on the bench, his arms wrapped around empty space.  
真嗣独自坐在长凳上，双臂环抱着空地。

'What was I?' he wondered.  
“我是什么？”他想知道。

Then the whiteness engulfed him as it had engulfed Asuka.  
然后白色吞没了他，就像吞没了明日香一样。

---

Lilith sat alone under the Tree of Life. Both Shinji and Asuka lay side by side in an almost comatose like state.  
莉莉丝独自坐在生命之树下。真嗣和明日香并肩躺着，几乎处于昏迷状态。

'Well, things can now progress as they wish,' thought Lilith as she let out a low sigh. Placing a hand over both Shinji's and Asuka's body, she moved them from the Garden of Eden, to the ruins of Tokyo-3 below.  
“好吧，现在事情可以如他们所愿地发展了。”莉莉丝低声叹了一口气。她将一只手放在真嗣和明日香的身上，将他们从伊甸园移至下方的第三东京废墟。

'Now comes the difficult part,' sighed Lilith. Without Shinji's body, Third Impact would crumble away. Even though the Black Egg would remain in tact, she now had to focus all her power into putting humanity to sleep.  
“现在困难的部分来了，”莉莉丝叹了口气。没有真嗣的身体，第三次冲击就会崩溃。尽管黑蛋完好无损，但她现在必须集中所有力量让人类陷入沉睡。

'I suppose I've got my work cut out for me,' thought Lilith. Turning back to the Tree of Life, she stared at it one final time. But she noticed something then.  
“我想我的工作已经完成了，”莉莉丝想。她转回生命之树，最后一次凝视它。但随后她注意到了一些事情。

"Hmph, Adam and Eve huh?"  
“哼，亚当和夏娃啊？”

Two sprouts had appeared on the Tree of Life's withered branches.  
生命之树枯萎的枝条上，已经长出了两根新芽。

'Well, its in there hands now,' thought Lilith.  
“好吧，现在它就在那儿了，”莉莉丝想。

Afterwards, she disappeared from that place, never again to return in any shape or form.  
之后，她就从那个地方消失了，再也没有以任何形式出现过。
