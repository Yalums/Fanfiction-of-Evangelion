Evangelion: Wake
By T. L. Webb

There was a burst of light, then silence.  
一阵光芒闪过，然后一片寂静。

For a long time after that Shinji Ikari felt nothing. Thengradually, his senses returned. The first was the sound of thewaves lapping at the sand that he now felt against his cheek. Hecould smell the salt water and taste the specks of sand against hislips. When he finally opened his eyes he saw crimson. After amoments shock he realized that his eyes weren't fooling him-- thewater was really red. In the distance he could see the horrifyingforms of the mass produced Evangelions standing out in thewater, their arms spread as if crucified.  
在那之后的很长一段时间里，碇真嗣都没有任何感觉。渐渐地，他的知觉恢复了。第一个是海浪拍打沙子的声音，他现在感觉到脸颊上有沙子。他能闻到咸水的味道，尝到嘴唇上沙粒的味道。当他终于睁开眼睛时，看到的是一片猩红。震惊了片刻之后，他意识到自己的眼睛没有欺骗他——水真的是红色的。在远处，他可以看到大量生产的新世纪福音战士的可怕形状站在水中，他们的手臂张开，仿佛被钉在十字架上。

As his vision focused further he could have sworn he saw Reistanding out on the surface of the red water, but as he blinked, thevision disappeared. Confused as to what he had just seen, hebegan to look around him.  
当他的视线进一步聚焦时，他可以发誓他看到了雷站在红色水面上，但当他眨眼时，视线消失了。他对自己刚才所看到的感到困惑，开始环顾四周。

Suddenly he saw something beside him out of the corner of hiseye. Turning to look, he received yet another shock.  
突然，他用眼角的余光看到了身边有什么东西。转头一看，他又是一惊。

It was her. 是她。

It began to come back to him in a rush. All the taunts, theinsults, the mocking... the kiss... NO! Even that had been one ofher little mindgames... one of her taunts. Why did it have to beher? Why now after everything he had gone through? Was thissome perverse idea of a reward? Was it a joke? She hated him!She despised him!  
他开始匆忙地想起这一点。所有的嘲讽、侮辱、嘲笑……亲吻……不！即便如此，这也是她的小心思游戏之一……她的嘲讽之一。为什么一定要beher？为什么现在在他经历了这一切之后呢？这是某种不正当的奖励观念吗？这是一个笑话吗？她恨他！她鄙视他！

It was all just too much!  
这一切都太过分了！

Not even realizing what he was doing, he climbed onto her andplaced his hands around her neck. His hysteria was just reachingits peak as he began to squeeze.  
他甚至没有意识到自己在做什么，就爬到了她身上，双手搂住了她的脖子。当他开始挤压时，他的歇斯底里刚刚达到顶峰。

'Why now after all this?' he thought in a cold rage, 'Why her?Why of all the people I knew did it have to be... w-what is shedoing?'  
“经历了这一切之后，为什么现在呢？”他冷冷地愤怒地想，“为什么是她？为什么我认识的人中一定是……她、她在做什么？”

Her eyes had opened as he began to choke her-- and while shehadn't made a sound, she had reached up to him. But not to try topry his hands away, not even to slap him. She had donesomething so totally unexpected that it cut him to the core.  
当他开始掐她的时候，她的眼睛睁开了——虽然她没有发出声音，但她已经向他伸出了手。但不要试图把他的手挣开，甚至不要扇他耳光。她做了一件完全出乎意料的事，让他痛心疾首。

She had gently caressed his cheek.  
她轻轻地抚摸着他的脸颊。

In his minds eye he could almost see the form of his mother asshe had touched him the same way.  
在他的脑海里，他几乎可以看到母亲的身影，因为她也以同样的方式抚摸着他。

NO! What was he doing?  
不！他在做什么？

His hands fell away and it all became just too great for him tobear. The tears came, wracking his body with sobs of pain, griefand self-loathing.  
他的手松开了，这一切对他来说实在是太难以承受了。泪水夺眶而出，痛苦、悲伤和自我厌恶的抽泣撕裂了他的身体。

Underneath the crying boy, Asuka Langely Soyru ignored thetears falling on her face and looked down at her arm, which forsome damned reason was wrapped in bandages. She looked fromher arm to the young boy who was kneeling over her in a mixtureof pity and disgust.  
在哭泣的男孩身下，明日香·兰格利·索伊鲁无视脸上的泪水，低头看着自己的手臂，不知为何，它缠着绷带。她的目光从自己的手臂转向跪在她身上的小男孩，眼神中夹杂着怜悯和厌恶。

"I think I'm gonna be sick." She said, mocking the crying boy.  
“我想我会生病。”她说道，嘲笑那个哭泣的男孩。

---

'Why'd I say that to him? Was it just out of habit?' She thoughtabout this for a moment before brushing off the idea. There weremore important things to think about-- like what was on her face.She reached up and felt the bandage over her eye.  
‘我为什么要对他这么说？这只是出于习惯吗？她想了一会儿这个问题，然后就打消了这个念头。还有更重要的事情要考虑——比如她脸上的东西。她伸手摸了摸眼睛上的绷带。

'How the hell did these get here,' she thought in confusion 'andfor that matter where the hell are we?'  
“这些到底是怎么到这里来的，”她困惑地想，“而且我们到底在哪里？”

There was movement above her as Shinji finally climbed offof her. Apparently he was getting himself under control. Hisbreathing was still erratic, but the tears had stopped. As he movedshe was suddenly aware of a sharp ache in several places on herbody. So _that's_ what the bandages were on her for. It seemedthat she hadn't managed to shut down the nerve connections asfast as she thought she had when those spears had begun to hither.  
当真嗣终于从她身上爬下来时，她上方有动静。显然他正在控制自己。他的呼吸仍然不稳定，但泪水已经止住了。当他移动的时候，她突然感觉身上好几个地方都传来一阵剧痛。这就是她身上缠绷带的目的。当那些长矛开始到达这里时，她似乎并没有像她想象的那样快地关闭神经连接。

Shinji looked down at her, and she saw confusion in his eyes.He kept looking at her arm and eye as if it were the mostdisturbing thing in the world… considering what had happened,she didn't really think it qualified as even being in the top ten.Then again who could understand what went through his head...probably something dirty.  
真嗣低头看着她，她在他眼中看到了困惑。他一直看着她的手臂和眼睛，仿佛这是世界上最令人不安的事情……考虑到发生的事情，她真的不认为这有资格在里面。前十名。再说了，谁能理解他脑子里在想什么……可能是一些肮脏的东西。

---

'It can't just be a coincidence' he thought, 'not when Ayanamihad the same injuries twice,' it was uncanny, and after... what hadhappened, Shinji had much less faith in the concept of coincidence.  
“这不可能只是巧合，”他想，“当绫波两次受同样的伤时，”这是不可思议的，而在……发生了什么事之后，真嗣对巧合的概念不再那么有信心了。

"Asuka? I-is that you?" he asked hesitantly while she painfullyclimbed to her feet. Was it really her? Well then again, it had tobe her; no one else he knew could look that annoyed with him.  
“明日香？我、是你吗？”当她痛苦地站起来时，他犹豫地问道。真的是她吗？话又说回来，一定是她；他认识的人中没有人会对他露出如此恼怒的表情。

"Of course its me, just how many gorgeous redheads do youknow anyway?"  
“当然是我，你到底认识多少个漂亮的红发女郎？”

It was her all right.  
没错，就是她。

He almost smiled.

Then he remembered who it was. Why was she here anyway?  
然后他想起了那人是谁。她为什么会在这里？

"Where the hell are we Shinji?" she asked as she stood up andlooked around.  
“我们真嗣到底在哪里？”她站起来环顾四周问道。

"I... I don't know, I only woke up a few moments ago."  
“我……我不知道，我才刚醒。”

"Oh and the first thing you do is choke the shit out of me huh?Joy," she said-- rolling her eye again. He hated it when she usedthat tone.  
“哦，你做的第一件事就是掐死我吧？快乐，”她说——又翻了个白眼。他讨厌她用那种语气。

"I think we're close to where the Geofront used to be," he saidstanding as well and brushing the sand off his pants. Sure enough,he could see a shattered dark shape rising from the water in thedistance. He recognized it as the black sphere that was onceNerv's base of operations. While he was looking around a glint ofmetal caught his eye.  
“我想我们已经接近 Geofront 原来的位置了，”他说着也站了起来，拍掉裤子上的沙子。果然，他看到远处的水面上升起了一个破碎的黑影。他认出那是一个黑色球体，曾经是Nerv的行动基地。当他环顾四周时，一道金属的光芒引起了他的注意。

"Well I'm not going to stand here and look at those... things allnight." She said gesturing out at the crucified Evas with a slightshudder. She started down the beach, then paused and lookedback.  
“好吧，我不会整夜站在这里看着那些……东西。”她一边说，一边微微颤抖地指着被钉在十字架上的伊瓦斯。她开始沿着海滩走下去，然后停下来回头看了一眼。

"Well?" she asked in _that_ tone again.  
“出色地？”她又用那种语气问道。

"Well what?"

"Are you coming?" she said putting her undamaged hand onher hip.  
“你来吗？”她说着，将未受伤的手放在臀部上。

'The hell?' he though. 'Why does she want me to come withher? Last time we spoke she said...'  
'地狱？'他虽然。 “她为什么要我跟她一起去？上次我们谈话时她说……”

"Why should I?" he asked as he looked at her suspiciously.  
“我为什么要？”他疑惑地看着她问道。

This actually seemed to throw her. For a moment she looked...hurt. But then she shifted back to the Asuka he knew far too well.  
这实际上似乎把她扔了。有那么一刻，她看上去……很受伤。但随后她又变回了他太熟悉的明日香。

"Because I told you to stupid," She countered angrily.  
“因为我告诉你要愚蠢，”她愤怒地反驳道。

Why did she always have to do this? He really didn't hate her;it was just that when she got like this she was so... difficult. Everyonce in awhile they would actually have a decent momenttogether, but the she would turn it off like a light switch and startacting like this. He had put up with it for almost a year.  
为什么她总是要这么做？他其实并不恨她，只是她变成这样的时候，她实在是太……难缠了。每隔一段时间，他们实际上会在一起度过一段美好的时光，但她会像关掉电灯开关一样关掉它，然后开始像这样。他已经忍受了快一年了。

Quite frankly he was tired of it.  
坦白说，他已经厌倦了。

The object glinting in the moonlight over toward the shorecaught his eye again, and he let out a little gasp as he recognizedwhat it was.  
岸边那个在月光下闪闪发光的物体再次引起了他的注意，当他认出那是什么时，他轻轻地喘了口气。

Ignoring Asuka-- who was less than happy about it, he walkedup to the fence and took the cross-shaped medallion off the peg itwas hanging on. Placing it around his neck, he closed his eyes ina moment of silence for Misato.  
他无视了对此不太高兴的明日香，走到栅栏前，从挂着的钉子上取下了十字形奖章。将它挂在脖子上，他闭上眼睛，为美里默哀片刻。

This moment did not last long.  
这一刻并没有持续多久。

"Did you go deaf? I said let's _go_ stupid!"  
“你是不是聋了？我说咱们傻吧！”

"Stop it." He said-- the sharpness of his voice startling themboth. Frowning, he turned to her holding the medallion up. "Doyou have any idea what happened to us? Do you even care?Everyone is gone Asuka! Everyone we knew, everyone I knew,Misato, Touji, Kensuke, Hikari, everyone! Does any of this evenbother you?"  
“停下来。”他说——他声音的尖锐让两人都吃了一惊。他皱起眉头，转向她，举起奖章。 “你知道我们发生了什么事吗？你关心吗？每个人都离开了飞鸟！我们认识的每个人，我认识的每个人，美里，东次，健介，光，每个人！这些都让你烦恼吗？”

She was quiet for a long time as they looked at one another.He refused to take the bait and turn away, not this time. Severalemotions flashed across her face, many of them he had never seenher express. Shame and embarrassment, while only residing therefor a moment, were the ones that stood out the most to him.  
他们互相看着对方，她沉默了很长一段时间。他拒绝上钩，转身离开，这次不是。她脸上闪过多种情绪，其中许多情绪他从未见过她表达过。羞耻和尴尬虽然只存在片刻，但对他来说却是最突出的。

Finally she stalked up towards him, the much more familiaremotions of annoyance and anger flashing in her eyes. Knowingfrom bitter experience what was most likely coming, Shinjifought the urge to back down, deep inside he knew he was donewith running.  
终于，她大步走向了他，眼中闪过熟悉的恼怒和愤怒的情绪。从痛苦的经历中知道最有可能发生的事情会发生，真嗣强忍住了退缩的冲动，在内心深处他知道自己已经不想再逃跑了。

"How dare you." She growled at him as she got up in his face.  
“你怎么敢。”当她站起来面对他时，她对他咆哮。

"How dare I what?" he said-- his voice giving the appearancethat he was much more calm than he really felt, "That I insinuatethat you don't care about anyone but yourself?"  
“我怎么敢做什么？”他说——他的声音​​听起来比他真正感觉的要平静得多，“我是在暗示你除了你自己之外不关心任何人吗？”

Her blue eye flashing with anger she drew back to hit him.Unfortunately she chose to use her injured arm to do this. Thebandaged limb swung forward and connected with the side ofShinji's face as he attempted to roll with the blow.  
她的蓝眼睛里闪烁着愤怒的光芒，她抽身就要打他。不幸的是，她选择用受伤的手臂来做这件事。当真嗣试图在这一击中翻滚时，缠着绷带的肢体向前摆动并与真嗣的脸侧相连。

This was not the best thing to do with an arm that was heavilyinjured.  
对于一只受了重伤的手臂来说，这并不是最好的做法。

A gasp of pain escaped her lips and she fell forwards cradlingher wounded limb. Shaking off the daze from the blow, Shinjibarely managed to catch her. Gently lowering her to the ground,and being careful not to jar her arm, he found that she had passedout.  
她的嘴里发出一声痛苦的喘息，她抱住受伤的肢体向前倒去。真嗣勉强摆脱了这一击带来的眩晕，勉强接住了她。他轻轻地将她放倒在地，小心翼翼地不要碰伤她的手臂，结果发现她已经昏倒了。

"You never did know when to stop did you?" he said softly ashe brushed a strand of hair off her face. He shook his head inwonder. "And I never could stay mad at you... God only knowswhy."  
“你从来不知道什么时候该停下来，不是吗？”他一边轻声说道，一边拨开她脸上的一缕头发。他疑惑地摇摇头。 “我永远不会生你的气……只有天知道为什么。”

When Asuka woke up again she was momentarily confused.Shinji was gone and she was alone on the beach. Not too long agothis would have been more than fine, but right now it scared her.And fear was something she did _not_ like. Not that it was aliento her, she had known fear in the past-- it was just that since shewas a child she had ignored it. She had fought it down and cagedit where it could not interfere with her duties as an Eva pilot.When the fear had returned it had mostly been of failure.  
当明日香再次醒来时，她一时感到困惑。真嗣已经走了，海滩上只剩下她一个人。不久前，这还好，但现在她害怕了。而恐惧是她不喜欢的。并不是说这对她来说是陌生的，她过去就知道恐惧——只是她从小就忽视了它。她已经把它压下去了，并在不妨碍她作为伊娃飞行员的职责的地方进行了控制。当恐惧再次出现时，它大多是失败的。

She didn't know why she was afraid now.  
她不知道自己为什么现在害怕。

She tried to tell herself she didn't care.  
她试图告诉自己她不在乎。

It wasn't working.

As she sat up, she found that she had been covered. Glancingdown she saw that it was Shinji's white shirt. For a moment shesmiled. It was a transformation that anyone, save Kaji, who mighthave known her before would have been hard pressed to believe.It seemed to spring from deep within her. A ghost of a smiledrifted to her lips as her eyes softened.  
当她坐起来的时候，发现自己已经被盖住了。她低头一看，发现那是真嗣的白衬衫。她微笑了一会儿。这种转变，除了加持以外，任何人都很难相信，因为以前可能认识她。这种转变似乎是从她内心深处涌出的。当她的眼神变得柔和时，她的嘴唇上浮现出一丝微笑。

It was a look of gratitude.  
那是一种感激的眼神。

She had never been really sure just why Shinji annoyed her somuch. When she had first seen him she had been less thanimpressed. He was a quiet, shy little boy who seemed to be mostcomfortable when the center of attention was well away fromhim. She had no problem with stealing that particular spotlight.Maybe that had been it. He always was so meek and obedient, justlike the first child. At first it had been fun to tease him, but as theangels kept getting stronger, and as his synch ratio started to passhers it had... changed. It had no longer been about kidding around.  
她一直不太清楚真嗣为何如此惹恼她。当她第一次见到他时，并没有留下什么印象。他是一个安静、害羞的小男孩，当注意力的中心远离他时，他似乎感到最舒服。她毫不犹豫地抢走了那个特别的聚光灯。也许就是这样。他总是那么温顺、听话，就像第一个孩子一样。起初取笑他很有趣，但随着天使变得越来越强大，当他的同步比率开始超过路人时，它已经……改变了。这不再是开玩笑。

It had no longer been because it was fun. It had turned into aneed-- a desire to bring him down that she'd quickly found thatshe had no control over.  
不再是因为它很有趣。它已经变成了一种欲望——一种想要打倒他的欲望，但她很快发现自己无法控制。

She didn't like to think about the way she had acted.  
她不愿意去想自己的行为方式。

Climbing to her feet she looked up and down the beach forsigns of him. There was a short trail of footprints from where theyhad woken up leading to where she now stood. Written in thesand on a small dune were the words "gone to look for shelter"and leading away from the dune was another set of prints. Takinganother glance at the shirt in her hand, she sighed.  
她站起来，在海滩上上下打量着，没有看到他的踪影。从他们醒来的地方有一小段脚印一直延伸到她现在站的地方。一个小沙丘上的沙子上写着“去寻找庇护所”的字样，远离沙丘的是另一组印刷品。又看了一眼手里的衬衫，她叹了口气。

'Why can't he just hate me like everyone else?' she thought asshe followed Shinji's footsteps down the beach, 'it would makeeverything so much simpler if he did.'  
“为什么他不能像其他人一样恨我呢？”当她沿着真嗣的脚步走下海滩时，她想，“如果他这样做的话，一切都会变得简单多了。”

---

"I can't believe its still there," Shinji said aloud.  
“我不敢相信它还在那里，”真嗣大声说道。

He was looking up at the hill that had housed Misato'sapartment.It had been built on the outskirts of the city, and he had neverquite understood why. She was the operations director and tacticaladviser for Nerv, yet she lived so far away from the Geofrontitself. Granted there was an express lift not very far away, but itwas still quite a trip to make if an Angel was attacking. Now hewondered if the shelter of the surrounding landscape had not beenmost of the reason.  
他抬头看着美里公寓所在的小山。它建在城市的郊区，他一直不太明白为什么。她是 Nerv 的运营总监和战术顾问，但她住的地方离 Geofront 很远。虽然距离不远有一个快速电梯，但如果天使来袭，这仍然是一段相当长的路程。现在他想知道周围景观的庇护是否不是主要原因。

The last battles with the angels had taken their toll on Tokyo 3;the city had been in ruins long before the JSSDF had been sent in.and still Misato's apartment stood. The big black sphere that hadturned out to be the Geofront itself had been unearthed, and stillthe apartment stood. Looking up at it from the beach, he wonderedwhat happened to PenPen. Last he had heard Hikari was going to takehim, but he admittedly hadn't been very interested in other peoplesproblems at the time.  
与天使的最后一场战斗给东京三号带来了损失；早在日本自卫队被派往这座城市之前，这座城市就已经是废墟了。而美里的公寓仍然矗立着。那个巨大的黑色球体，后来被证明是地质前线本身，已经被挖掘出来，而公寓仍然矗立在那里。从海滩上抬头望去，他想知道彭彭出了什么事。最后他听说光要带他去，但他承认当时他对其他人的问题不太感兴趣。

Then there had been the whole thing with Rei. He had decidedthat he didn't want to understand that mess. So many things hisfather had done disgusted him, but Rei was one he doubted hecould ever forgive.  
然后就是丽的整件事了。他决定不想理解那团乱七八糟的事情。他父亲所做的很多事情都让他感到厌恶，但他怀疑自己永远无法原谅雷伊。

"Why did you do it?" he asked aloud. "What were youexpecting to get out of it all?"  
“你为什么要那么做？”他大声问道。 “你希望从这一切中得到什么？”

"Did you always talk to yourself, or is this new?" came anunexpected voice from behind.  
“你总是自言自语，还是这是新的？”背后传来了意想不到的声音。

"Hello Auska," he said without turning.  
“你好，奥斯卡，”他没有转身说道。

"Is that?" she started as she saw the apartment on the hill.  
“就是它？”当她看到山上的公寓时，她吃了一惊。

"Yes."

"Um... do you know if my stuff is still there?"  
“呃……你知道我的东西还在吗？”

"What?"

"My stuff, did Misato throw it out after I left?"  
“我的东西，我走后美里扔掉了吗？”

"Of course not, why would she do something like that?"  
“当然不是，她为什么要这么做？”

"Well its not like I left on good terms with her."  
“嗯，看来我和她的关系并不好。”

He turned to look at her; she was looking up at their old homewistfully. "I don't understand, I thought you just disappeared."  
他转身看着她；她若有所思地抬头看着他们的老家。 “我不明白，我还以为你失踪了呢。”

"It wasn't exactly as clean cut as that."  
“事情并不那么干净利落。”

"I see." He said as he started up towards the apartment.  
“我懂了。”他边说边朝公寓走去。

---

She did a double take as he walked off.  
当他走开时，她多看了一眼。

"What the hell is wrong with you?" she said under her breath.What was with him? He never acted like this! Well, at least hehad stopped and was waiting for her. She wondered what wasgoing on in that little head of his. Something big had obviouslyhappened to him.  
“你到底怎么了？”她低声问道。他怎么了？他从来没有这样的举动！好吧，至少他停下来等她了。她想知道他那小小的脑袋里到底在想什么。他显然发生了大事。

"Hey wait up damnit!" she yelled as she followed him up thehill.  
“喂，等一下该死的！”她一边跟着他上山一边喊道。

As they cleared a ridge he looked back and saw something thatmade his eyes soften. As he looked away quickly and hurried onpast some debris Asuka looked to see what it had been. Sheimmediately wished she hadn't.  
当他们越过山脊时，他回头看到了一些东西，这让他的目光变得柔和。当他迅速移开视线，匆匆走过一些碎片时，明日香想看看那是什么。她立刻希望自己没有这么做。

"Mein Gott!" she screamed.  
“我的哥特！”她尖叫起来。

It was Rei. 是丽。

Or rather it looked like her, only it was just part of her headand it was the size of a small mountain. It was a horrifying sightto say the least. She looked back up as Shinji, then at the giantRei that she now saw was slowly dissolving to nothing.Something had happened and she wanted to know what.  
或者说，它看起来像她，只是它只是她头的一部分，而且有一座小山那么大。至少可以说，这是一个可怕的景象。她回头看着真嗣，然后看着她现在看到的巨大的丽正在慢慢消失。发生了一些事情，她想知道是什么。

The apartment was not quite as intact as it had looked. Debrisfrom Lilith's ascension and the JSSDF attack had damaged thebuilding and there were several holes in the ceiling, but he wassure he could patch those given time and tools. He had donesimilar work at his Uncle's after a hailstorm. He opened the doorfor Asuka and they went inside. The power was gone, but therewas enough light from the windows that they could see. Save fora few broken dishes and one shattered window, the place wassurprisingly clean, but that was not the biggest surprise. As Asukawent into the kitchen she found that the several dozen bottles ofalcohol that normally lined the sink were missing.  
公寓并不像看上去那么完好。莉莉丝升天和 JSSDF 袭击产生的碎片损坏了建筑物，天花板上有几个洞，但他确信他可以在给定的时间和工具下修补这些洞。冰雹过后，他在叔叔家做过类似的工作。他为明日香打开门，他们进去了。停电了，但窗户里有足够的光线让他们看得见。除了几个破盘子和一扇破碎的窗户外，这个地方出人意料地干净，但这还不是最大的惊喜。当明日香走进厨房时，她发现通常放在水槽里的几十瓶酒精不见了。

"Shinji... did Misato quit drinking while I was gone?" Sheasked.  
“真嗣……我不在的时候美里就戒酒了吗？”她问。

"I don't know, I was pretty out of it near the end."  
“我不知道，快结束时我已经很不舒服了。”

"The end of what? What happened Shinji, I don't understandthis!Where is everyone?"  
“什么结束了？发生了什么事真嗣，我不明白这个！大家都在哪里？”

"They returned to Lilith." He said sadly.  
“他们回到了莉莉丝身边。”他悲伤地说。

"Who?"

"It's a long story, I don't really understand much myself, and Iwas there. I haven't had much of a chance to sort things out."  
“这是一个很长的故事，我自己也不太了解，而且我就在那里。我没有太多机会来解决问题。”

"Well I'm beat, you can tell me tomorrow."  
“好吧，我已经被打败了，你明天再告诉我吧。”

With that Asuka headed to her room. A few moments later,Shinji was about to do the same when he found Asuka staring intoher room from the hall with a slightly disturbed look on her face.  
说完，明日香就往自己的房间走去。过了一会儿，真嗣正要这么做，却发现明日香在大厅里盯着自己的房间，脸上带着些许不安的表情。

"Asuka? What is it?"  
“明日香？什么事？”

"W-what did I do in here?" she asked in a small voice.  
“我、我在这里做了什么？”她小声问道。

Walking up next to her, he saw that her room was a wreck. Hevaguely recalled Misato telling Ritsuko that she was going toleave Asuka's room as she had left it, but he hadn't know that ithad been left in such bad shape.  
走到她身边，发现她的房间已经是一片废墟。依稀记得美里告诉律子她要离开明日香的房间，但他不知道房间已经被弄得这么糟糕了。

"I think most of it happened after I got out of Unit 01," He saidremembering that she had been much more prone to throwing fitsafter he returned. They had mostly avoided one another after that.  
“我想大部分事情都是在我离开一号部队之后发生的，”他回忆起他回来后她更容易发脾气。从那以后，他们基本上就互相回避了。

"Why did I do this Shinji? I know I was angry but... my stuff!"  
“我为什么要这么做真嗣？我知道我很生气，但是……我的东西！”

"I don't know Asuka, I never pretended to understand you verymuch," He said with a shrug. This drew an annoyed look from theredhead. Deciding he didn't feel like another fight, he made aquick suggestion.  
“我不认识明日香，我从来没有假装很了解你，”他耸耸肩说道。这引起了红发人恼怒的目光。他决定不想再打架，于是快速提出了一个建议。

"Why don't you sleep in Misato's room, and I'll help you cleanthis up later."  
“你去美里的房间睡吧，待会儿我帮你收拾一下。”

The idea seemed to bother her slightly, but she agreed. Shewas exhausted.  
这个想法似乎让她有点困扰，但她同意了。她已经筋疲力尽了。

Stepping into Misato's room Asuka felt a bit strange. She hadbeen angry with a lot of people before she had run away, but shehad saved a special piece of hatred for Misato. Mostly she didn'tknow what to make of her whole relationship with Kaji, whenthey had seen each other on the 'over the rainbow' she had seemedto hate him. That had been fine, Asuka wanted Kaji's attention allto herself.  
踏入美里的房间，明日香感到有些奇怪。她在逃跑之前曾生过很多人的气，但她却为美里留下了一份特殊的仇恨。大多数情况下，她不知道如何看待她与加持的整个关系，当他们在“彩虹之上”见面时，她似乎讨厌他。那很好，明日香希望加持的注意力全部集中在她自己身上。

But then it had become painfully obvious that Kaji intended topursue Misato. One thing after another had piled up; failure afterfailure had struck her. Those last weeks before her coma werelittle more than a blur to her now, and she was thankful for that ina way.  
但随后，令人痛苦的是，加持想要追求美里的意图变得显而易见。一件又一件的事情堆积起来；一次又一次的失败向她袭来。昏迷前的最后几周现在对她来说只是模糊的，她在某种程度上对此表示感谢。

Looking around she saw that the answering machine had beenremoved from the phone, and was sitting on Misato's desk.Curious as to what it was doing there Auska walked up and sawan empty package of batteries, and that the message light wasblinking. Intrigued, she reached over and pressed play.  
环顾四周，她发现答录机已从电话上取下，放在美里的桌子上。奥斯卡很好奇它在那里做什么，走上前，看到一个空包的电池，留言灯正在闪烁。她感到好奇，伸手按下播放键。

To her shock Kaji's voice came drifting from the speakers.  
令她震惊的是，扬声器中传来了加持的声音。

"Katsuragi, it's me. I'm sure you're listening to this message,after I've caused you so much trouble. Sorry. Please tell Ritsu"I'm sorry." too. And there's one more thing to trouble you with:I've been growing... flowers. I'd appreciate it if you could waterthem. Shinji knows where they are. Katsuragi, the truth is withyou. Don't hesitate. Move ahead! If I can see you again, I will saythe words that I could not say eight years ago. Bye."  
“葛城，是我。我确定你正在听这条信息，因为我给你带来了这么多麻烦。对不起。请也告诉律“对不起。”还有一件事要麻烦你了与：我一直在种花。如果你能知道它们在哪里，我会很感激，如果我能再次见到你，那就别犹豫了！我会说八年前无法说的话。”

---

From his room, Shinji heard the sobs. Worried that Asukamight be in trouble, he jumped to his feet and hurried to Misato'sroom. The door was open and when he stepped in to the darkenedroom he saw Asuka sitting on the floor, her knees drawn up andheld by her free hand. She was shaking; he hadn't been hearingthings.  
真嗣从自己的房间里听到了抽泣声。他担心明日香会遇到麻烦，一跃而起，匆匆赶往美里的房间。门开着，当他走进黑暗的房间时，他看到明日香坐在地板上，膝盖弯曲，用空着的手握住。她浑身发抖。他没有听到任何声音。

"Asuka?" he said from the doorway.  
“明日香？”他在门口说道。

She looked up at him, and he was a bit surprised not to seeany tears. Taking a deep breath, he walked in and sat down besideher on the floor. She watched him do this with a touch ofconfusion. He faced her and sat a moment trying to phrase whathe wanted to say correctly.  
她抬头看着他，他有点惊讶没有看到眼泪。深吸一口气，他走进去，坐在她旁边的地板上。她带着一丝困惑看着他这样做。他面对着她，坐了一会儿，试图正确地表达他想说的话。

"If this is something you don't want to, or can't talk about thenthat's fine," he said, breaking the silence, "but if... _when_ you dowant to; I'm right here, and I'll listen."  
“如果这是你不想谈或不能谈的事，那也没关系，”他打破沉默说道，“但是如果……当你愿意的时候；我就在这里，我会的。”听。”

---

As he spoke to her, she found a sharp remark on the tip of hertongue. It had always been her first instinct to any suggestion thatshe might need help, or that she couldn't handle something on herown. She still didn't think that she needed anyone else, that shedidn't need help, or assistance. Even days ago she would haveyelled that she didn't need him anywhere near her, but as she bitdown the rude remark that was set to fly at Shinji, she discoveredsomething.  
当他对她说话时，她发现舌尖上有一句尖锐的话。当有人暗示她可能需要帮助，或者她无法独自处理某些事情时，这始终是她的第一直觉。她仍然不认为她需要其他人，她不需要帮助或帮助。就在几天前，她还会大喊大叫，说她不需要他靠近她，但当她咬下这句对真嗣说的粗鲁的话时，她发现了一些事情。

She _wanted_ him close by.  
她想要他在身边。

---

She hadn't yelled at him yet... that was a good sign. The lasttime they had spoke was just before she had run away, and it hadnot been pleasant for him. He had just started to recover from hismonth long imprisonment in Unit 01 and had not been verytogether at the time. The fact that he had been refused theopportunity to help when she was attacked had not helped any. Hehad been worried about her, but had not known what to do. Heknew so little about her; he wouldn't even have begun to knowwhere to look. They had found her seven days later, and it hadn'tbeen pretty. He had seen her in the infirmary a few weeks later...she had recovered, but not by much. And she still hadn't wokenup.  
她还没有对他大喊大叫……这是一个好兆头。他们最后一次说话是在她逃跑之前，这对他来说并不愉快。他刚从一队一个月的监禁中恢复过来，当时心情不太好。事实上，当她受到攻击时，他被拒绝提供帮助的机会，这对他没有任何帮助。他很担心她，但又不知道该怎么办。他对她知之甚少；他甚至不知道该往哪里看。七天后他们找到了她，情况并不美好。几周后他在医务室见到了她……她已经康复了，但恢复得并不好。而她还没有醒来。

'Hers was the beauty of blades in an alley,' he thought,remembering a random quote that Kensuke had once pulled fromsomewhere to describe her. A small smile crossed his face as heremembered his friends. They had taken an immediate dislike toAsuka almost from the moment they had met her, Touji inparticular. They had more often than not referred to her as "thedemon", and it wasn't as if Asuka hadn't given them reason. Ofall his classmates, only Hikari had really been friendly with her.  
“她的美是小巷里的刀锋之美，”他想道，想起了健介曾经从某个地方随意引用的一句话来形容她。当他想起他的朋友们时，他的脸上浮现出一丝微笑。几乎从见到明日香的那一刻起，他们就立刻不喜欢她，尤其是东次。他们经常称她为“恶魔”，明日香也不是没有给他们理由。在他的所有同学中，只有光对她真正友好。

She had seemed to like it that way.  
她似乎很喜欢这样。

He didn't know what it was about Asuka that made her sohostile to everyone, he had never been able to work up thecourage to ask, he didn't think now was the time to do so either.She still hadn't said anything, so he decided to break the silenceagain.  
他不知道明日香到底是什么原因让她对所有人都如此敌视，他一直没能鼓起勇气去问，他也不认为现在是问的时候。她还是没有说什么。于是，他决定再次打破沉默。

"You know... it just occurred to me; I never did get much outof it when I did that," This had the intended effect of startling herout of herself.  
“你知道……这只是我突然想到的；当我这么做的时候，我并没有从中得到什么。”这达到了让她惊慌失措的预期效果。

"W-what?" she asked, still startled by his words.  
“什、什么？”她问道，仍然被他的话吓了一跳。

"You saw me do almost the same thing a lot, I would put onmy headphones and crawl up into myself trying to blockeverything out. Shutting off the world. I'll admit it felt good toget away from everything like that, but when I came out of it thethings that had hurt me were still there, and usually had gottenworse because instead of actually dealing with them I had ignoredthem."  
“你经常看到我做几乎同样的事情，我会戴上耳机，爬进自己的身体，试图将一切都挡在外面。关闭世界。我承认，远离这样的一切感觉很好，但当我来的时候其中，那些伤害过我的事情仍然存在，而且通常会变得更糟，因为我没有真正处理它们，而是忽略了它们。”

"Why did you keep doing it?"  
“你为什么一直这样做？”

"Well with some of it there was nothing I could have everdone about it, so in those cases I guess it helped me deal with it,but there were a few times that I really feel disgusted that I didnothing when I could have made a real difference."  
“好吧，对于其中的一些事情，我无能为力，所以在那些情况下，我想它帮助我处理了它，但有几次，我真的感到厌恶，因为我本可以做一个真正的事情，但我却什么也没做。不同之处。”

He was quiet after that and Asuka thought about what he hadsaid.  
此后他安静下来，明日香思考着他所说的话。

"Kaji left a message for Misato before he died," She saidfinally.  
“加持在死前给美里留下了一条信息，”她最后说道。

Shinji's eyes widened. He had heard the message in part thenightMisato had first played it, but he hadn't been able to do anythingto comfort her. It had been another thing he was ashamed of.  
真嗣睁大了眼睛。当美里第一次播放这首歌的那天晚上，他已经听到了部分信息，但他无法做任何事情来安慰她。这又是他感到羞耻的一件事。

He had dimly suspected that Kaji might have died, but hehadn't known that Asuka had found out. Considering her...affection for Kaji, her collapse so soon after his death put thingsin better perspective. But the important thing now was that shewas actually talking to him, opening up for the first time. If hewere to do any good here it would have to be before she closedhim off again.  
他隐约怀疑加持可能已经死了，但他不知道明日香已经发现了。考虑到她……对加持的感情，她在加持死后不久就崩溃了，这让事情变得更好了。但现在重要的是她真的在和他说话，第一次敞开心扉。如果他想在这里做任何好事，就必须在她再次把他封锁之前。

"I'm sorry, it must have been hard to listen to it like this."  
“抱歉，这样听一定很难受。”

"It doesn't hurt as bad as I thought it would when I first heardhis voice. I knew he loved Misato, I just..." a tear began to buildat the corner of her eye, but she was obviously fighting it back.  
“当我第一次听到他的声音时，它并没有我想象的那么痛苦。我知道他爱美里，我只是……”泪水开始在她的眼角积聚，但她显然在强忍着。

"You miss him," he said looking down at the medallion aroundhis neck, "Listen, a lot happened and I don't think its possible towork it all out in one week, let alone one night. Why don't we getsome sleep."  
“你想念他，”他低头看着脖子上的徽章，“听着，发生了很多事情，我认为不可能在一周内解决所有问题，更不用说一个晚上了。我们为什么不好好睡一觉呢？” ”。

"Okay," She said, the weariness evident in her voice.  
“好吧，”她说，声音里明显带着疲倦。

He slept in the living room that night.  
那天晚上他就睡在客厅里。

---

'Oh not again,' he thought with a groan.  
“哦，别再这样了，”他呻吟着想。

It had been two days and she was yelling at him again. Thistime it was something about the broken water pumps. She hadstarted with the complaining the day before and he had decidedthe best way to deal with it was to just ride it out.  
已经两天了，她又对他大喊大叫。这次是关于水泵坏了的事情。她前一天就开始抱怨，而他决定最好的处理方法就是安然度过。

"Will you at least look at me when I talk to you?"  
“我和你说话的时候你至少能看着我吗？”

He had been trying to get some work done; it was a nice dayand perfect to be out and about. At least it had been until she hadswitched back to the old Asuka, and had started driving him upthe wall. Trying to ignore her long enough to get the roof patcheddidn't seem to be an option anymore. Unfortunately ignoringAsuka did not make her go away, if anything it just pissed her offeven more.  
他一直在努力完成一些工作；这是美好的一天，非常适合出去走走。至少直到她变回原来的明日香，并开始把他逼上墙。试图忽视她足够长的时间来修补屋顶似乎不再是一个选择。不幸的是，忽视明日香并没有让她离开，如果有什么不同的话，那就是让她更加生气。

"Say something already!" she shouted at him, "anything!"  
“有话就说吧！”她对他喊道：“什么都可以！”

Finally he had enough of it.  
最后他受够了。

"What?" he spat-- tuning and looking at her with calmness thatshe was still unused to from him. "Why are you suddenly so eagerto hear my voice? So you can tell me to shut up and remind mehow much I disgust you?"  
“什么？”他吐了口唾沫——语气平静地看着她，她还是不习惯他这样。 “你为什么突然这么渴望听到我的声音？这样你就可以让我闭嘴，提醒我我有多恶心你？”

"Are you still hung up over that?" she asked, surprised, "Ionly said that because just after you finally showed some spinefor the first time in your life you started crying like a baby."  
“你还为此耿耿于怀吗？”她惊讶地问道：“我之所以这么说，是因为就在你生平第一次终于露出脊梁骨之后，你就开始像婴儿一样哭泣。”

"Am I not allowed to feel ashamed for choking you? Or sad atloosing everyone I knew and getting stuck alone with someonewho hates me?"  
“难道我不可以因为掐死你而感到羞耻吗？或者因为失去了我认识的每个人而与一个恨我的人单独相处而感到悲伤？”

She paused at this. "If you felt so bad about it why did you doit in the first place? And who ever said I hated you?"  
说到这里，她停了下来。 “如果你对此感到如此难过，那么你一开始为什么要这么做？谁说过我恨你？”

Shinji sat down on the edge of the platform he was standing onand looked at her in frustration. He knew that Asuka had a lot ofnerve, but this was a bit much.  
真嗣在他所站的平台边缘坐下，沮丧地看着她。他知道明日香很有胆量，但这有点过分了。

"You said you hated me the last time we spoke before ThirdImpact," He told her coolly, "As for the rest, it might have beenbecause ever since I met you, you have done nothing but insultme, put me down, all for no reason I might add. And to top it alloff, the one time I desperately needed your help you refused meand turned your back."  
“上次我们在第三次冲击之前说话的时候，你说你恨我，”他冷冷地告诉她，“至于其他的，可能是因为自从我遇见你以来，你除了侮辱我、贬低我之外，什么也没做，这一切都是为了没有任何结果。”我可能会补充一点，最重要的是，有一次我迫切需要你的帮助，你拒绝了，就意味着你转身离开了。”

" . . . "

"Look I got to get these boards in place, if it rains we're gonnaget soaked," He turned back and continued working.  
“听着，我必须把这些木板安装到位，如果下雨我们就会被淋湿，”他转身继续工作。

"I... I'm sorry."

His head jerked up and he slowly turned around. Asuka wasstill there but her head was bowed, her eye hidden by her hair.  
他猛地抬起头，缓缓转过身。明日香还在那里，但她低着头，眼睛被头发遮住了。

"What?" he asked. This was not something he had heard often,especially from Asuka. He was a little unsure weather to trust hisears.  
“什么？”他问。这不是他经常听到的，尤其是从明日香那里听到的。他有点不确定天气是否可以相信自己的耳朵。

"What do you want?" she said suddenly becoming angry, "Meto sing it from the damn roof? I'm sorry already."  
“你想要什么？”她突然生气了，“我要在该死的屋顶上唱这首歌吗？我已经很抱歉了。”

Shinji was quiet for several moments, then climbed down,"Asuka..."  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，然后爬了下来，“明日香……”

"Are you happy now? I've degraded myself before the highand mighty Shinji Ikari."  
“你现在幸福了吗？在高高在上的碇真嗣面前我已经自卑了。”

"_Stop_ that!"

"Why?" she yelled back, challenging him to contradict her.  
“为什么？”她大声喊道，要求他反驳她。

"Because I'm _tired_ of it, I'm tired of listening to the samething over and over! You're like some kind of broken record whenyou get like this," He sat down and leaned against the side of thebuilding, "Ever since I met you all you've done is mock me. If itwasn't about me moping around and feeling sorry for myself--which admittedly I disserved-- you were screaming about how Iwas 'showing you up' when I actually did _something_ right. I'mtired of it ok? Just what do you want from me?"  
“因为我厌倦了，我厌倦了一遍又一遍地听同样的东西！当你变成这样的时候，你就像某种破唱片，”他坐下来，靠在大楼的一侧，“从来没有自从我遇见你以来，你所做的一切就是嘲笑我，如果不是我闷闷不乐、为自己感到难过——这确实是我应该做的——你就会尖叫着说我在做某事时是在“展示你”。对吧，我已经厌倦了，你想从我这里得到什么？”

---

This finally cut through. She stopped and her face went blankas she realized she didn't know the answer.  
这下终于打通了。她停了下来，脸色一片茫然，因为她意识到自己不知道答案。

What do I want from him?  
我想从他那里得到什么？

Why am I even talking to him?  
我为什么还要跟他说话？

Why does he care?  
他为什么关心？

Why do I care? ... Wait... that was the question, wasn't it?  
我为什么关心？ ……等等……这就是问题所在，不是吗？

What about him made it so important that she prove herself tohim?  
他到底是什么原因让她向他证明自己如此重要？

Had it just been because Ayanami had been interested?  
难道只是因为绫波感兴趣吗？

No. There was a lot more to it than that.  
不，还有更多的事情要做。

In her minds eye she could clearly see the red haze of thevolcano where she had battled the eighth Angel. She had knownat that moment she would die. It in away had been a comfort, achance to finally rest. Then there had been a sudden shock.  
在她的脑海中，她可以清楚地看到她与第八位天使战斗的火山的红色薄雾。那一刻她就知道自己会死。离开这里是一种安慰，是终于休息的机会。然后突然震惊了。

It had been him.  
本来就是他。

He had leapt Unit 01 into a live volcano with no armor andonly a badly damaged cable between him and oblivion. He hadrisked his life for hers... against orders no less. That had been thefirst time she had looked at him as anything other than a wimpylittle boy.  
他把 01 号机跳进了一座活火山，没有装甲，只有一条严重损坏的电缆连接着他和湮灭。他为了她的生命冒着生命危险……同样违背命令。那是她第一次不再以一个懦弱的小男孩的眼光来看待他。

It hadn't lasted however; Shinji had a tendency to back awayfrom problems that drove her up the wall. Particularly after shehad seen him at his best. The meek little kid that she had sharedMisato's apartment with for so long didn't hardly seem the sameas the one who had fought the fourteenth angel to a standstillbefore loosing power.  
然而这种情况并没有持续多久；真嗣有一种回避那些让她陷入困境的问题的倾向。尤其是在她见过他最好的状态之后。那个和她在美里的公寓住了这么久的温顺的小孩子，和那个在失去力量之前与第十四天使战斗到停滞不前的那个孩子看起来不太一样。

'Is that why I get so angry with him? Is that why he drives meso crazy?' she thought. 'I never could understand it. He's like afrightened kitten most of the time, but he took down two angelssingle-handedly and several more even after he got help. It justdoesn't make sense.'  
“这就是我对他这么生气的原因吗？这就是他让中观疯狂的原因吗？她想。 '我永远无法理解它。大多数时候他就像受惊的小猫一样，但他单枪匹马地击倒了两名天使，甚至在得到帮助后还击倒了更多天使。这根本没有意义。

She looked at him now, and she wondered what had changedin him after the third impact. There was something at the cornerof his eyes, something almost frightening. It reminded her a bit ofthe few times she had met Commander Ikari.  
她现在看着他，想知道第三次撞击后他发生了什么变化。他的眼角有某种东西，一种近乎可怕的东西。这让她想起了与碇司令的几次见面。

Now there was a disturbing thought.  
现在有一个令人不安的想法。

But in front of that was still the same Shinji. And she had toadmit, for all of her teasing he wasn't the worst example of themale species.  
但眼前的还是原来的真嗣。她不得不承认，尽管她不断地取笑他，但他并不是男性物种中最糟糕的例子。

He could be incredibly brave...  
他可能非常勇敢......

But he could also be a pathetic coward  
但他也可能是一个可悲的胆小鬼

She still didn't know why he acted the way he did. Perhaps itwas time to find out  
她还是不明白，他为什么会做出这样的举动。也许是时候找出答案了

"Why didn't you get any training before the first fight?" sheasked, completely confusing Shinji who was still waiting on ananswer to his question.  
“为什么你在第一场比赛之前没有接受任何训练？”她问道，这让仍在等待问题答案的真嗣彻底困惑了。

"W-what?"

Realizing she had changed subjects on him, she thought for asecond before continuing.  
意识到自己改变了话题，她想了一会儿才继续说道。

"I need to know some stuff before I can answer that. Nowspill. Why did they send you out with no training against the thirdangel?"  
“我需要知道一些事情才能回答这个问题。现在溢出了。为什么他们在没有接受过对抗第三天使训练的情况下就派你出去？”

---

Shinji's eyes narrowed a bit as he thought back to his arrival inTokyo3. His father standing above the cage looking down at him.His own fear and shame that he would still be useless to the man.The man... was he even that? How could he have done the thingshe had done and still honestly believe that Mother would wanthim back? With a small growl Shinji tried to answer Asuka'squestion.  
当真嗣回想起自己抵达东京时，他的眼睛眯了起来。他的父亲站在笼子上方俯视着他。他自己的恐惧和耻辱，他对这个男人仍然毫无用处。这个男人……他还是那样吗？他怎么可能做了她所做的事情，还真诚地相信母亲会想要他回来？真嗣低声咆哮着，试图回答明日香的问题。

"I received no training because my father cast me aside as auseless tool and ignored me for years, until he found that he stillneeded me," He spat the words out with such venom that hesucceeded in not only startling Asuka, but frightening himself aswell.  
“我没有接受过任何训练，因为我的父亲把我当作无用的工具，多年来一直忽视我，直到他发现他仍然需要我。”他恶毒地吐出这句话，不仅吓到了明日香，也吓到了他自己。

With difficulty he continued.  
他艰难地继续说道。

"My 'father' decided that Rei would be a more suitable choiceand left me with my uncle. He... I suppose you could use the term'raised' her to be the pilot of Unit 01, but she was hurt during theactivation of the prototype. So he sent for me."  
“我的‘父亲’认为丽是一个更合适的选择，把我留给了我的叔叔。他……我想你可以用‘培养’她这个词来让她成为01号机的飞行员，但她在激活01号机的过程中受伤了。所以他派人来找我。”

Asuka was a bit shocked. She had known that the other twopilots were weird, but she'd had no idea that the Commander hadactually been the reason they were so screwed up.  
明日香有点震惊。她知道另外两名飞行员很奇怪，但她不知道指挥官实际上是他们搞砸的原因。

'Like you should talk Langley,' she heard her inner self say.  
“就像你应该谈谈兰利一样，”她听到自己内心说。

"Wait... he... he raised the first child?"  
“等等……他……他抚养了第一个孩子？”

"I don't think the word applies, but yeah. You never did seeher apartment did you?"  
“我认为这个词不适用，但是是的。你从来没有去过她的公寓，不是吗？”

"No."

"Picture Misato's room the day before we did all the cleaning.Then take away all the furniture, posters, flowers and otherdecorations."  
“想象一下我们打扫所有房间的前一天美里的房间。然后拿走所有的家具、海报、鲜花和其他装饰品。”

"If it were anyone else we were talking about that would soundinsane."  
“如果我们谈论的是其他人，那听起来就很疯狂。”

"It is insane. It only gets worse too," The darkness in his eyeswas growing-- and Asuka wanted to tell him to stop and shut up,be she was too dumfounded by what she had learned so far tospeak.  
“这太疯狂了。只会变得更糟。”他眼中的黑暗越来越深——明日香想让他停下来闭嘴，因为到目前为止她所学到的东西让她惊呆了，无法说话。

"The sick part is that seems Rei was a clone. Not a clone ofjust anyone; they must have used what was left of my motherafter her accident for the base. I suppose they figured she wouldhave a better chance of synchronizing with Unit 01 that way."  
“令人作呕的是，丽似乎是一个克隆人。不是任何人的克隆人；他们一定用了我母亲在事故发生后留下的东西作为基地。我想他们认为这样她会有更好的机会与 01 号部队同步”。

---

Asuka's eyes grew wider as he spoke. Not just because of therevelations, Shinji's voice was growing more manic as hecontinued.  
明日香说话时眼睛睁得更大。不只是因为事情的真相，真嗣的声音也变得更加狂躁。

"Ritsuko must have known all about this, I imagine that's whyshe was so amused when Misato thought I had a crush on her.Plus she was in love with 'father' and I guess she couldn't standthe idea of Rei being competition for ... God I don't even want toimagine that! Why did he do that to her? Why did he let her growup like some worthless puppet? She deserved better! She wasn't adoll, she was never a doll! She was a GOD DAMN HUMANBEING!"  
“律子一定知道这一切，我想这就是为什么当美里认为我迷恋她时她会如此好笑。而且她爱上了‘父亲’，我猜她无法忍受丽被竞争的想法。 .. 天哪，我什至不想想象！他为什么要这样对她？为什么他让她像一个毫无价值的木偶一样长大？她不是一个洋娃娃，她从来都不是一个洋娃娃！该死的人类！”

Shinji turned and threw a wild punch at a nearby window,succeeding in cracking the thick glass and slicing his knuckles.Dropping to the ground and cradling his bleeding hand; he wasstill shaking in rage when Asuka tentatively reached out andplaced a hand on his shoulder.  
真嗣转身向附近的窗户猛烈一拳，成功打碎了厚厚的玻璃，割伤了他的指关节。当明日香试探性地伸出一只手放在他的肩膀上时，他还在愤怒地颤抖。

'I... I didn't know!' Asuka thought as she led him back inside,'Oh Gott... how could I have known?' It was only a few secondsbefore the unwanted answer came to her.  
“我……我不知道！”明日香一边把他带回屋里，一边想，“天哪……我怎么知道？”只过了几秒钟，她就得到了这个不想要的答案。

'I could have asked... I _should_ have asked.'  
“我本来可以问的……我应该问的。”

As he wrapped his hand in a damp cloth, Asuka watched on insilence. "Shinji... I didn't know," She said softly.  
明日香用湿布包住自己的手，一言不发地看着他。 “真嗣……我不知道，”她轻声说道。

"I didn't know most of it myself until after you disappeared.Some of it I didn't piece together until just before the end. All Iknew before that was that I despised my father for what he haddone to all of us. I think the part about Rei makes me so angrybecause it makes me wish he hadn't left me... because I wouldrather her have had a chance to live like an actual person than togrow up under him the way he planned. He let her live in that rundown dirty hovel. He let her grow up alone without friends. Hemade her the way she was. I can forgive a lot Asuka, but not that.Not that. He wasted her life."  
“直到你消失之后，我自己才知道其中的大部分内容。其中一些直到结束前我才拼凑起来。在那之前我只知道我鄙视我的父亲对我们所有人所做的一切。我想想关于雷的部分让我很生气，因为这让我希望他没有离开我……因为我宁愿她有机会像一个真正的人一样生活，而不是按照他计划的方式在他的统治下长大。他让她在没有朋友的情况下独自成长，我可以原谅明日香，但不是这样。”

"You said that she was a..."  
“你说她是一个……”

"Clone. Like in the sci-fi movies Kensuke always broughtover. I suspected that... something was strange near the end of itall. Mostly because of things she said and things she did. Thingsthat that brought out the few memories that I have of mother.Then after the sixteenth angel with everything Ritsuko told us...look I'm not saying I understand this whole mess, but what I sawand heard disgusted me. I will never forgive him."  
“克隆人。就像科幻电影中健介总是带过来的一样。我怀疑……接近尾声时有些奇怪的东西。主要是因为她说的话和做的事。那些勾起了我仅有的记忆的事情然后，在第十六位天使告诉我们的一切之后……我并不是说我理解这一切，但我所看到和听到的让我感到恶心，我永远不会原谅他。”

Asuka could see the darkness growing again. She quicklydecided another subject change was in order.  
明日香可以看到黑暗再次变大。她很快决定再次改变主题。

"Was Misato right?" she asked playfully.  
“美里说得对吗？”她开玩笑地问道。

"What?"

"Did you have a crush on Rei?"  
“你对雷伊有好感吗？”

He quickly blushed, and the darkness receded... This was agood sign.  
他很快脸红了，黑暗退去……这是一个好兆头。

"I think so, at least in the beginning. It still weirds me out nowafter all the things I found out."  
“我想是的，至少在一开始是这样。在我发现了所有这些事情之后，现在仍然让我感到很奇怪。”

"I remember. I tried to tease you about it once."  
“我记得。有一次我想取笑你。”

"Oh yeah...'secret meetings' wasn't that how you tried to putit?"  
“哦，是的……‘秘密会议’这不是你想说的吗？”

"I think so, its kind of hard to remember all the cheep shots Itake at people."  
“我想是的，要记住我对别人发出的所有低声镜头有点困难。”

"At least your honest about it... Its still not nice."  
“至少你对此很诚实……还是不太好。”

"Humph. You wanted to know what I want from you Shinji? Iwanted you to stop cowering and show some of that spine thatpeeks out every once in awhile. That's why I teased you so much.I want to see the Pilot who leaped into a blazing volcano to savehis teammate, not the cowering little wimp who apologizes toeverything I say."  
“哼。真嗣，你想知道我想从你这里得到什么吗？我想让你别再畏缩了，露出一点时不时露出来的脊椎骨。所以我才这么捉弄你。我想看看飞行员跳进了是为了拯救他的队友而燃烧的火山，而不是那个对我所说的一切道歉的畏缩的小懦夫。”

"Then you don't know me."  
“那你就不认识我了。”

"Huh?"

"The Shinji Ikari that leaped into the lava is the same ShinjiIkari who you hate."  
“跳进熔岩的碇真嗣就是你所讨厌的碇真嗣。”

"Gah! This again? I don't hate you."  
“嘎啊！又这样？我不恨你。”

"You say that, but you act like you do so often I have a hardtime accepting it. But to expound, I jumped into the lava to keepyou from getting hurt. I hated piloting because all I seemed to dowhen I got in to that thing was cause people to get hurt. Did I evertell you about Touji's sister? She was hurt in my first fight. Shewas hurt because I was too afraid to try and properly pilot thething."  
“你这么说，但你的表现就像你经常做的那样，我很难接受。但要解释一下，我跳进了熔岩中，以防止你受伤。我讨厌驾驶，因为当我进入那件事时，我似乎所做的一切是导致人们受伤的原因。我有没有告诉过你关于 Touji 妹妹的事？她在我的第一次战斗中受伤了，因为我太害怕尝试正确驾驶这东西了。”

"What the hell are you talking about? You didn't even have acrash course! It took me and Rei months and months to even getour synch rates high enough to move a hand, much less walk!"  
“你到底在说什么？你连速成课程都没有！我和雷花了好几个月的时间才让我们的同步率高到足以移动一只手，更不用说走路了！”

"It was still my responsibility, and I tried to run from it."  
“这仍然是我的责任，我试图逃避它。”

"You're right, I don't know you." Asuka said shaking her head,"One moment I think I understand you-- then you throwsomething like this out at me. No wonder you didn't know whyyou piloted. Your dad screwed you up bigtime."  
“你说得对，我不认识你。”明日香摇着头说：“有一瞬间我以为我理解你了——然后你就向我扔出这样的东西。难怪你不知道为什么要驾驶。你爸爸把你搞砸了。”

Shinji nodded.

"Yes," he said simply.

---

"Ok, you're clear, keep it steady... now!"  
“好吧，你已经清楚了，保持稳定……现在！”

The large tank slid out of the truckbed and down into the ditchwith a thud. When the dust settled Asuka and Shinji walked upand began checking for cracks in the metal. The idea had been asimple one.  
大坦克从卡车上滑出，轰然一声掉进沟里。当尘埃落定后，明日香和真嗣走上前去，开始检查金属上是否有裂缝。这个想法很简单。

They needed fresh water.  
他们需要淡水。

Lots of it.

Preferably running. 最好是跑步。

There wasn't a stream anywhere near enough for theirpurposes, soShinji had done some reading and had come up with this. Misato'sapartment had been on a slope, but hadn't been at the top. Theyhad taken a large water tank from a storage yard a few milesaway. With an old pickup truck, a little creative welding andenough rope to hog-tie Unit 01 they had managed to haul it up tothe top of the building. All they had to do now was fill it and runa pipe to the apartment and they would have running water.  
附近没有足够的溪流来满足他们的目的，所以真嗣做了一些阅读并想出了这个。美里的公寓位于斜坡上，但并未位于山顶。他们从几英里外的一个储藏场拿走了一个大水箱。他们用一辆旧皮卡、一点创意焊接和足够的绳子将 01 号机组绑起来，成功地将其拖到了大楼的顶部。他们现在所要做的就是填满水并用管道连接到公寓，他们就会有自来水了。

Now they just had to figure out how to heat it and they wouldbe in much better shape. Not that they hadn't figured out how tohave a hot shower every once in awhile, All that took was acampfire, a hose with a showerhead on the end and some boiledwater.  
现在他们只需要弄清楚如何加热它，他们的状态就会好得多。并不是说他们没有想出如何偶尔洗个热水澡，所需要的只是篝火、末端带有淋浴喷头的软管和一些开水。

And Shinji's solemn promise not to peek.  
还有真嗣郑重承诺不偷看。

Of course, this was not nearly as easy as it sounded. UntilAsuka's arm was fully healed she was somewhat limited in hermovements, and this led to the problem with washing her hair. Itwas about a week and a half before she managed to work up thenerve to ask him.  
当然，这并不像听起来那么容易。在明日香的手臂完全痊愈之前，她的行动有些受限，这导致了她洗头发的问题。大约一个半星期后，她才鼓起勇气去问他。

---

"You want me to _what_?" Shinji asked with honest surprise.  
“你要我做什么？”真嗣惊讶地问道。

"Oh come on, its not like I'm asking you to climb into the tuband scrub my back, I just need you to help me shampoo my hair. Ican't do it right with my arm like this."  
“哦，得了吧，我又不是要你爬进浴盆里擦我的背，我只是需要你帮我洗头。我这样用胳膊洗不了。”

Still a little nervous, and confused, he agreed to help. Fifteenminutes later on the patio she stepped out in her bathing suit andsat down in the chair he had set up. Her eye was healing quicklyand she had opted for using a pair of sunshades with a pad in theeye instead of the bandage, but her arm was still tightly wrappedin the cast. Other than the bandages she was still as breathtakingas she had been the day he had met her.  
尽管有点紧张和困惑，他还是同意提供帮助。十五分钟后，她穿着泳衣走到露台上，坐在他设置的椅子上。她的眼睛恢复得很快，她选择使用一副带有眼垫的遮阳罩来代替绷带，但她的手臂仍然紧紧地裹着石膏。除了绷带之外，她仍然像他见到她那天一样令人惊叹。

Trying as best as he was able not to stare at her, he sat down inthe other chair and picked up the first bucket to wet down herhair.  
他尽量不盯着她看，在另一把椅子上坐下，拿起第一个水桶，把她的头发弄湿。

"Okay, Third Child-- first step is the blue bottle. Don't use toomuch, its not like I can fly to Germany and pick up more."  
“好吧，老三，第一步就是蓝瓶，别用太多，我又不能飞到德国去取更多。”

He took a moment and removed the contents of the bag shehad brought out. There were several bottles of hair care products.After pouring the first bucket of and selecting the blue bottle asinstructed, he squeezed a small amount into his hand and rubbedit into both palms before beginning on her hair. As he scrubbedthe suds into her hair and scalp he thought again how beautifulshe was. There was no real doubt about it; the only thing thatreally dimmed any attraction he had felt in the past was herattitude.  
他花了一会儿时间，取出了她拿出来的包里的东西。护发用品有好几瓶，倒了第一桶，按照指示选了蓝色的瓶子，挤了少量到手上，擦到双掌上，开始给她的头发抹。当他用泡沫擦洗她的头发和头皮时，他再次想到她是多么美丽。对此毫无疑问。唯一真正削弱了他过去对他的吸引力的是她的态度。

Calling her a brat was an understatement, and closer to theend it had gotten worse. The few times he had found himselfthinking of her in a romantic light had been short lived. The firsthad been the night before they fought the seventh angel when shehad been sleepwalking and... had that been an accident? She hadseemed oblivious the next morning. Despite the fact she had spenthalf the night on his bedroll. Her only comment had been to kickhim awake from his spot on the floor several feet away and tellhim to get up.  
称她为小鬼还算轻描淡写，而且越接近尾声，情况就越糟糕。他发现自己曾有几次以浪漫的眼光思考她，但这种想法并没有持续太久。第一次是在他们与第七位天使战斗的前一天晚上，当时她正在梦游……那是一场意外吗？第二天早上她似乎浑然不觉。尽管事实上她在他的铺盖卷上度过了半个晚上。她唯一的评论就是把他从几英尺外的地板上踢醒，并告诉他站起来。

He had wondered for a long time if she had been reallysleepwalking that night.  
他很长一段时间都想知道她那天晚上是否真的梦游了。

---

'I wonder what he's thinking about,' Asuka thought with aslight grin, 'Given the angle, probably my cleavage.' She let out asmall giggle at the idea. The truth was that poor Shinji wasprobably trying as hard as he could not to look at her cleavage.The same had been true that day at the pool when she had madeher first effort to flirt with him. As he rinsed the second bottle'scontents out of her hair and started on the third, she thought backto the night she had teased him into kissing her. She had beenthinking about Kaji and kissing him when it occurred to her thatshe had never actually kissed anyone.  
“我不知道他在想什么，”明日香微笑着想，“从角度来看，可能是我的乳沟。”听到这个想法，她咯咯地笑了一声。事实上，可怜的真嗣可能竭尽全力不去看她的乳沟。那天在泳池里，当她第一次努力与他调情时，情况也是如此。当他把第二瓶里的东西从她头发上冲洗掉并开始清洗第三瓶时，她回想起那天晚上她逗弄他亲吻她的情景。她一直在想着加持并亲吻他，这时她突然想到自己从未真正亲吻过任何人。

Realizing that she might need practice at something like that,she had immediately elected Shinji as her test subject. Inhindsight it might not have been the best idea in the world toclamp his nose closed, but it was her first time after all, and she'dhad no idea that it would have lasted as long as it did. It wouldhave lasted much longer if she hadn't realized she was enjoyingit.  
意识到自己可能需要练习这样的事情，她立即选择了真嗣作为她的测试对象。事后看来，夹住他的鼻子可能不是世界上最好的主意，但毕竟这是她第一次，她不知道它会持续这么久。如果她没有意识到自己很享受的话，这种感觉还会持续更长时间。

---

"Hey Asuka?" Shinji asked suddenly.

He was one more rinse away from being done and Asuka wassitting back with an almost sensual smile on her face-- caught upin the pleasure of having someone else pamper her. In truth theywere both enjoying the contact more than they would willinglyadmit. Her eyebrows raised from behind her shades and she madea small sound indicating her attention.  
他还需要再冲洗一次，明日香坐在后面，脸上挂着近乎性感的微笑——沉浸在有人宠爱她的快乐之中。事实上，他们都比他们愿意承认的更享受这种接触。她的眉毛从墨镜后面扬起，并发出轻微的声音以表明她的注意力。

"Honest truth. Were you really sleepwalking that night beforewe fought the seventh angel?"  
“实话实说。在我们与第七位天使战斗的前一天晚上，你真的在​​梦游吗？”

A wry grin crossed her lips. "Why? Wondering if I saw youdoing something naughty while you thought I was asleep?" sheasked while suppressing a laugh.  
她的嘴角掠过一丝苦笑。 “为什么？想知道我是不是看到你在以为我睡着的时候做了什么调皮的事？”她强忍着笑声问道。

She had expected several possible responses, blushing,changing the subject, stammering, but not the one she got.  
她预料到会有几种可能的反应，脸红、转移话题、结结巴巴，但她得到的却不是这样。

The dark cloud that had overtaken Shinji's face a few times inthe past few days returned stronger than ever. He rinsed the soapfrom her hair and rushed through the last stage like a machine.When he was done stood and handed her a towel before almoststorming back inside.  
这几天曾数次笼罩真嗣脸上的乌云，再次变得比以往更加强烈。他冲洗掉她头发上的肥皂，然后像一台机器一样冲过最后一个阶段。完成后，他站起来递给她一条毛巾，然后几乎冲了进去。

Sitting up quickly and wrapping her wet hair in the towel, shehurried after him. What had she said? If it were merelyembarrassing him she could understand, but this was somethingdifferent. She was familiar with his responses to her teasing, andthis wasn't the same. She found him on the balcony next door. Hewas leaning against the rail with his head buried in his arms. Helooked like he was crying.  
她迅速坐起身来，用毛巾裹住湿漉漉的头发，急忙追了上去。她说什么了？如果这只是让他难堪，她可以理解，但这次就不一样了。她很熟悉他对她的戏弄的反应，但这次不一样。她在隔壁的阳台上找到了他。他靠在栏杆上，把头埋在双臂里。他看起来像是在哭。

"Shinji?"

"Get away from me... I'm a monster," He said quietly, hisvoice filled with a shame that seemed to hurt him physically.  
“离我远点……我是个怪物。”他轻声说道，声音里充满了羞耻感，似乎让他的身体受到了伤害。

"W-what are you talking about?"  
“你、你在说什么？”

"I'm disgusting, I shouldn't be near you."  
“我很恶心，我不应该靠近你。”

"Shinji? Talk to me here, what's wrong?"  
“真嗣？在这里跟我说话，有什么事吗？”

"If I tell you you'll hate me."  
“如果我告诉你，你会恨我的。”

"We've been through this, I don't hate you."  
“我们都经历过这些，我不恨你。”

"You will. Anyone would. I do."  
“你会的。任何人都会的。我会的。”

"Shinji what could you have done that could be so awful that ithurts to even _think_ about it?"  
“真嗣，你到底做了什么事情，竟然如此可怕，连想起来都觉得心痛？”

Shinji was quiet for a long time before he finally spoke up.When he began to speak his voice was so filled with shame that itshocked her almost as much as what he had to say. He startedwith Kaworu, the confusion that resulted, the pain that hadfollowed the death of one of the only people who had ever openlyadmitted they cared for him. The desperation that he had felt witheveryone he knew gone. As he told of his visit to her room hereyes widened in slight fear that he had done something to herwhile she slept. Then they narrowed in disgust as she heard whathe had actually done, then a blank expression fell across her faceas he tried to explain the hollowness that had followed his attemptto give some measure of pleasure to himself.  
真嗣沉默了很长时间才终于开口。当他开口说话时，他的声音充满了羞愧，几乎和他要说的话一样让她震惊。他从薰开始，他是唯一公开承认关心他的人之一，他死后所带来的混乱和痛苦。他对每个认识的人都感到的绝望已经消失了。当他讲述他造访她房间的事时，他的眼睛睁大了，有点担心他在她睡觉时对她做了什么。然后，当她听到他实际上做了什么时，他们厌恶地眯起眼睛，然后当他试图解释他试图给自己带来某种程度的快乐之后的空虚时，她的脸上出现了茫然的表情。

"I still don't know why I did it Asuka, it gained me nothing, itrevolts me even now. I'm no better than a rapist. I'm scum. Eventhen I was disgusted," He looked up and saw her staring at himblankly. Hanging his head he continued, "I told you that youwould hate me. You were right all along, I am a pervert. I'll movemy things here. I shouldn't be allowed near you."  
“我还是不知道我为什么要这样做，明日香，它对我没有任何好处，甚至现在都让我感到厌恶。我不比强奸犯好多少。我是人渣。即使我很恶心，”他抬起头，看到她凝视着面无表情地看着他。他低着头继续说道：“我说过你会恨我的。你一直都是对的，我是个变态，我会把我的东西搬到这里来，不应该让我靠近你。”

He stood and began to walk away  
他站起来并开始走开

"Hold it."

Halfway into the door, Shinji stopped. His head still loweredin shame, he turned back, expecting to be hit or worse anysecond. He was prepared for any punishment she deemednecessary.  
进了门一半，真嗣停了下来。他仍然羞愧地低着头，转过身来，预计随时都会受到打击，甚至更糟。他已经准备好接受她认为必要的任何惩罚。

What he didn't expect was that she was not furious. Not to sayshe didn't look angry, but she looked more... annoyed thananything. Her voice was tense nonetheless.  
让他没想到的是，她并没有生气。并不是说她看起来不生气，但她看起来比任何事情都更……生气。尽管如此，她的声音还是很紧张。

"Listen up, stupid, because I'm only going to say this once,"She told him. "I do not, I repeat, NOT hate you. It's not as easy tosay that at the moment, but I want you to get that through yourthick little skull before I tell you the rest of this. Most every guy Iever met, yes even Kaji, has been little more than a perverted jerk.I am disappointed in you, but not as angry I could be. You betterthank whoever it is you Japanese worship that all you did wasspank off that day. Otherwise I might have thrown you off thisledge."  
“听着，傻瓜，因为我只会说一次，”她告诉他。 “我不，我重复一遍，不恨你。现在说这些并不容易，但在我告诉你剩下的事情之前，我希望你能通过你厚实的小脑袋明白这一点。大多数我见过的人，是的，甚至卡吉，只不过是个变态的混蛋。我对你感到失望，但我也没有那么生气，你最好感谢你那天所做的一切，因为你日本人崇拜的是谁，否则我可能会把你从这个壁架上扔下来。 ”。

She let out a sharp breath and seemed to calm down slightly.Walking up to him she looked him up and down then nodded.  
她猛地吸了一口气，似乎稍微平静下来。走到他面前，上下打量了他一眼，然后点了点头。

"One more thing and then I don't want you to ever mentionthis again."  
“还有一件事，我不希望你再提这件事。”

He was still feeling the slap three hours later.  
三个小时后，他仍能感觉到被打的一巴掌。

---

The next day started better, both Asuka and Shinji felt as ifthey'd gotten something important sorted out. But, as it wore on,their interaction together steadily grew worse.  
第二天开始好多了，明日香和真嗣都觉得好像解决了一些重要的事情。但随着时间的推移，他们之间的互动逐渐恶化。

They had taken the truck down to the far side of the bay topick up some rice and other foodstuffs from one of the survivingstores in the area. With so many roads in such bad shape, thepickup was one of the few vehicles they'd found that couldnavigate the terrain with any amount of safety.  
他们把卡车开到海湾的另一边，从该地区一家幸存的商店买了一些大米和其他食品。由于有如此多的道路状况如此糟糕，这辆皮卡是他们发现的少数能够在地形上安全行驶的车辆之一。

The drive was slow; they had to stop several times so that theycould move stalled vehicles off the road. When they arrived,Shinji jumped out and hurried over to open her door.  
车开得很慢；他们不得不多次停车，以便将抛锚的车辆移离道路。当他们到达时，真嗣跳下车，赶紧过去开门。

She was daydreaming when she slipped on the rail and felldown on him. Her sunglasses and the pad that had rested over hereye went sailing and she clamped her eyes shut to try and protectthem from the imminent impact and bright sun. To her surprisehowever, instead of folding under her weight, he managed to gethis feet positioned fast enough to actually catch her.  
当她在做白日梦时，她在栏杆上滑倒，摔倒在他身上。她的太阳镜和放在眼睛上的护垫开始航行，她闭上眼睛，试图保护它们免受即将到来的撞击和明亮的阳光的影响。然而，令她惊讶的是，他并没有被她的体重压倒，而是设法以足够快的速度抓住她。

"Let me go!" she shouted as she tried to climb off of him,succeeding only in sending both of them to the ground. He got tohis feet and stood there awkwardly as she looked around for herglasses. Finding them quickly she returned them to her face andtried to get to her feet.  
“让我走！”她一边喊一边试图从他身上爬下来，结果却把他们俩都摔倒在地。当她环顾四周寻找眼镜时，他站了起来，尴尬地站在那里。她很快就找到了它们，然后将它们放回到自己的脸上，并试图站起来。

It didn't quite work as she planned. The side of the truckoffered no handhold and she was still far too sore to climb upwithout one. Shinji saw this quickly and reached down to help herto her feet.  
这并没有完全按照她的计划进行。卡车的一侧没有把手，她仍然感到疼痛，无法在没有把手的情况下爬上去。真嗣很快看到了这一点，伸手扶她站起来。

Her response was a bitter stream of German curse words and aglare that could possibly have melted steel. She slapped his handaway with her uninjured one.  
她的回应是一连串苦涩的德国咒语和可能融化钢铁的怒视。她用未受伤的手拍打他的手。

"I don't need your damn help third child, back off."  
“我不需要你该死的帮助老三，退后吧。”

Had she been paying attention she might have saved them bothhalf a day of trouble, but true to form Asuka missed Shinji'sreaction to this.  
如果她注意的话，也许可以为他们俩省去半天的麻烦，但明日香一如既往地错过了真嗣对此的反应。

Until he picked her up that was.  
直到他接她。

"What the hell are you doing!" she yelled as he reached downand picked her up with no consideration of hand placement, orgentleness.  
“你到底在做什么！”当他伸手把她抱起来时，她喊道，完全没有考虑手的位置和温柔。

"Shinji Ikari, you put me down this minute!" she continuedscreaming as she began trying to hit him and kicking her feetaround.He completely ignored her as he walked into the store. She was sointent on wriggling free that she failed to notice the severalscratches she was leaving on his arms and face.  
“碇真司，你就这么放倒我了！”当她开始试图打他并踢腿时，她继续尖叫。当他走进商店时，他完全无视她。她拼命挣脱，没有注意到自己在他手臂和脸上留下的几处抓痕。

"If you don't put me down right now I'm going to--" she nevergot a chance to finish as Shinji picked that moment to dump herunceremoniously on one of the waist-high checkout counters.Ignoring the fact that the counter offered her a perfect position toget to her feet without further risk of falling; she quickly sat up,slid off and stormed off after him; fully intending to beat the hellout of him.  
“如果你现在不放我下来，我就要——”她根本没有机会把话说完，真嗣却毫不客气地将她扔到一个齐腰高的收银台上。她的位置非常完美，可以让她站起来，而不会再有摔倒的风险；她迅速坐起身来，猛地追上他。完全是想狠狠地揍他一顿。

It was not a large store and it only took a few seconds to findhim standing in front of the medical supplies and opening apackage of bandages. As she stomped up to him he looked up andshe saw the scratches on his face.  
这不是一家大商店，只花了几秒钟就发现他站在医疗用品前，打开了一包绷带。当她跺脚向他走来时，他抬起头，看到了他脸上的抓痕。

It threw her. 它把她摔倒了。

She tried to forget it and chew him out as intended but he juststood there looking at her. Not flinching, not cowering back,apparently not even afraid. He looked her right in the eye anddidn't even blink.  
她试图忘记这件事，并按原计划训斥他，但他只是站在那里看着她。没有退缩，没有退缩，显然甚至没有害怕。他直视着她的眼睛，甚至连眼睛都没眨一下。

To say the least she was not used to this from him.  
至少可以说，她不习惯他这样。

For what might have been the first time she blinked first. Asshe turned away, he finished opening the package and beganputting them on his bleeding cuts.  
这可能是她第一次先眨眼。当她转身离开时，他打开了包裹，开始将它们敷在流血的伤口上。

Cursing herself silently she finally got her nerve back up.  
心里默默地咒骂着自己，她终于恢复了平静。

"What the hell was that about?" she demanded.  
“那到底是怎么回事？”她问道。

"If you don't take it easy your wounds won't heal. That meansyou have to stop pushing yourself like that."  
“如果你不放松，你的伤口就不会愈合。这意味着你必须停止这样逼迫自己。”

"I don't need your damn help Shinji."  
“真嗣，我不需要你的帮助。”

"Yes you do. Whatever damage those lances did to your Evatranslated to a physical effect on you. Your ribs are still bruised,your arm has been hurt three times since we woke up, and we stilldon't know how badly you're hurt internally other than it doesn'tseem to slow you down much. But if you keep trying to act likenothing is wrong you're going to end up in a wheelchair, and I'mdamn sure you wouldn't like that. So for the time being you arejust going have to deal with my help."  
“是的，你知道。无论那些长矛对你的伊娃造成了什么样的伤害，都会对你产生物理影响。你的肋骨仍然瘀伤，自从我们醒来以来，你的手臂已经受伤了三次，而我们仍然不知道你伤得有多严重但如果你继续表现得好像没什么问题，你最终会坐在轮椅上，我确信你暂时不会喜欢这样。因为你只是需要我的帮助。”

With that he applied the last of the bandages and walked downthe row toward the canned goods. Behind him Asuka again beganangrily cursing in German.  
说完，他缠上了最后一块绷带，然后沿着一排罐头食品走去。在他身后，明日香又开始用德语愤怒地咒骂。

---

The trip back to the apartment was made in silence. Asuka hadfinally accepted that Shinji was right about her condition, but shedidn't have to like it.  
返回公寓的路上，一路上一片寂静。明日香终于承认真嗣对她的状况的看法是正确的，但她不必喜欢这样。

Shinji on the other hand had resigned himself to the fact thathe and Asuka were going to be at best friendly enemies for therest of their time together. He wasn't sure how long that would be;his time with her before third impact had conditioned him tomostly ignore her insults and taunts. If she didn't like him hecould live with that, but he would stay at least long enough to seeher through her injuries. If she didn't want him around then therewas nothing he could do.  
另一方面，真嗣已经接受了这样一个事实：他和明日香在剩下的时间里充其量只能是友好的敌人。他不确定那会持续多久；在第三次撞击之前他和她在一起的时间已经让他习惯于忽略她的侮辱和嘲讽。如果她不喜欢他，他也可以忍受，但他至少会留下足够长的时间来陪伴她度过伤痛。如果她不想让他在身边，那么他也无能为力。

His feelings toward her were complicated. He did care forher... he couldn't deny that. She was breathtakingly beautiful, shehad a confidence and determination he envied, and she seemed toknow no fear save that of failure. But then there was her attitude...  
他对她的感情很复杂。他确实在乎她……这一点他无法否认。她美得令人窒息，她有令他羡慕的自信和决心，而且除了失败之外，她似乎不知道任何恐惧。但接下来就是她的态度……

'How many times am I going to go over this in my head beforeI admit I'm falling in love with her despite the fact that shedoesn't feel the same?' he thought to himself as he pulled in theapartment's driveway. 'Even when she hurts me... even when shecalls me names and taunts me...' he let out a small chuckle as heshook his head.  
“在我承认我爱上她之前，我要在脑子里想多少次，尽管她的感觉并不一样？”当他把车开进公寓的车道时，他心里想着。 “即使她伤害了我……即使她辱骂我、嘲笑我……”他一边轻笑一边摇着头。

'Am I screwed up or what?'  
“我是搞砸了还是怎么的？”

However, as he helped Asuka out of the truck a few minuteslater, he was surprised to hear her mutter a 'thank you' under herbreath before walking off to her room.  
然而，几分钟后，当他把明日香从卡车上扶起来时，他惊讶地听到她低声说了句“谢谢”，然后就走向了自己的房间。

"Well... damn," He said once she was out of earshot.  
“呃……该死，”等她听不见他的声音时，他说道。

---

"Is this really going to work?" Asuka asked hesitantly from herplace at the wheel.  
“这真的有用吗？”明日香在驾驶座上犹豫地问道。

"I think it should," Shinji replied as he loaded anotherspeargun. "All I can think that might go wrong is the splash mightcapsize us, but that's why we're wearing the life jackets."  
“我认为应该如此，”真嗣一边回答一边给另一把鱼枪上膛。 “我认为可能出现的问题是水花可能会把我们翻倒，但这就是我们穿着救生衣的原因。”

They had both gotten more than tired of the giant MassProduced Evas that stood out in the bay that had once beenTokyo3. So they had come up with a way to get rid of them. Itwasn't the best plan Asuka had ever heard, but she didn't see anyreason it wouldn't work.  
他们都已经厌倦了在曾经是东京的海湾中矗立着的巨型量产伊娃号。所以他们想出了一个办法来摆脱它们。这不是明日香听过的最好的计划，但她看不出有什么理由行不通。

They had taken a tugboat, several spearguns, and some very,very strong wire. The plan was to pull the Evas over and thendrag them off to another part of the bay. This would at least getthem out of sight. To that end they were almost ready to haul overthe first of the three in the bay.  
他们拿了一艘拖船、几支鱼枪和一些非常非常坚固的铁丝。计划是把逃亡者号拉过来，然后拖到海湾的另一个地方。这至少会让他们离开人们的视线。为此，他们几乎准备好将海湾中的三艘船中的第一艘拖过去。

"I think you got enough of those ropes ready, should I start thewench on the anchor?"  
“我想你已经准备好了足够多的绳子，我应该把那个女孩放在锚上吗？”

"Yeah, but don't gun the engine right away. Start slow and letssee if I messed up any of these knots before we start pulling."  
“是的，但不要马上发动引擎。慢慢开始，在我们开始拉动之前看看我是否弄乱了这些结。”

She looked back at him on the deck and sighed. He was beingthe old Shinji again and it was pissing her off.  
她回头看着甲板上的他，叹了口气。他又变成了以前的真嗣，这让她很生气。

"You checked them four times and they were fine then. Justget up there and man the knife!"  
“你检查了四次，然后就没事了。站起来拿刀！”

She yelled back at him. The knife in question was a shortsword they had found in an abandoned house nearby. The ideawas to cut the wires and run if the Eva started to tilt the wrongway. To facilitate this all the ropes were linked to one master knotthat they had found in an old sailor's handbook when they werelearning how to operate the tug.  
她对他大喊。这把刀是他们在附近一所废弃房屋中发现的一把短剑。这个想法是，如果伊娃开始向错误的方向倾斜，就切断电线并运行。为了方便这一点，所有绳索都连接到一个主结上，这是他们在学习如何操作拖船时在一本旧水手手册中找到的。

"Ok, let me get into position and we're all set!" he shoutedfrom outside the cab of the boat.  
“好的，我就位，我们就准备好了！”他在船的驾驶室外面喊道。

"Ready when you are!" she yelled back as she checked theengine displays.  
“准备好了！”她一边检查发动机显示屏，一边喊道。

As he yelled to go she slammed the accelerator forward andthe powerful little boat shot ahead. There was a creak from theframe and a sudden lurch when the ropes caught, but momentslater she could feel the slack give way and she let out a shout oftriumph. This was cut short by a sound she had only heard onceor twice before.  
当他大喊要走时，她向前猛踩油门，强大的小船向前冲去。当绳子卡住时，框架发出吱吱声，突然倾斜，但过了一会儿，她感觉到松弛消失了，她发出了胜利的呼喊。这句话被她之前只听过一两次的声音打断了。

Shinji was cursing

She heard a loud twanging sound and saw the ropes give wayin the mirror just moments before Shinji ducked in and grabbedher hand, pulling her outside and over the edge. She didn't havetime to respond or protest as a monstrous wave caught hold ofthem and swept the boat over on its side. When the wave hadpassed she saw the boat several meters away lying upside down inthe water.  
她听到一声巨响，看到镜子里的绳子松开了，就在真嗣冲进去抓住她的手，把她拉到外面并越过边缘时。她还没来得及做出反应或抗议，一股巨大的波浪就抓住了他们，把船横翻了。当波浪过去时，她看到几米外的船倒在水中。

"What the hell?"

"I realized as the Eva fell that the wave was much bigger thanI thought," he explained as they floated in the warm water, "if wehadn't cut loose the ropes would have torn the boat apart and ifwe hadn't jumped we would be underwater right now."  
“当伊娃号落下时，我意识到波浪比我想象的要大得多，”当他们漂浮在温暖的水中时，他解释道，“如果我们不松开绳索，船就会被撕裂，如果我们不跳下去，我们就会现在就在水下。”

"Way to go Dummkopf, you could have killed us there."  
“干得好，Dummkopf，你可能会在那里杀了我们。”

"I know," he apologized quietly, "Asuka I'm sorry I shouldn'thave put you in danger like that."  
“我知道，”他低声道歉，“明日香很抱歉，我不应该让你陷入这样的危险。”

"Humph. I'll let that one slide. By the way, you want to tell mewhy you're holding on so tight?"  
“哼。那我就不说了。顺便问一下，你想告诉我为什么你抓得这么紧吗？”

"I... I can't swim," he said with a blush.  
“我……我不会游泳，”他红着脸说道。

"WHAT? You let me drag you out here without… YOUIDIOT!" she screamed at him. "If you ever do anything thatdangerous again I'm going to kick your ass to the damn moon!Do you hear me Ikari?"  
“什么？你让我把你拖到这里来，却没有……你这个白痴！”她对他尖叫。 “如果你再做那么危险的事情，我会把你踢到该死的月亮上！你听到我说话了吗，碇？”

"Yes ma'am," he said quietly.  
“是的，女士，”他轻声说道。

'Why the hell is he smiling?' she thought as they slowly swamtoward the beach. 'What has he got to be so happy about?'  
“他到底为什么笑？”她一边想，一边慢慢地游向海滩。 “他有什么事这么高兴？”

Finally she got fed up with his silence and demanded ananswer.  
最后，她厌倦了他的沉默，要求得到答案。

"We were actually working together back there." He said, thesmile never leaving his face.  
“我们实际上在那里一起工作。”他说着，脸上的笑容从未消失。

"Yeah... I guess all that synch training paid off with more thanjust one fight."  
“是的……我想所有同步训练的回报不仅仅是一场战斗。”

"Hey Asuka... did you ever wonder what it would have beenlike if we weren't pilots? If we had just been regular kids?"  
“嘿明日香……你有没有想过如果我们不是飞行员会是什么样子？如果我们只是普通孩子会是什么样子？”

"Well you would probably know how to swim for one thing…but jokes aside no I haven't. Eva has been such a huge part of mylife for so long... to tell the truth living without it is a bitfrightening."  
“好吧，你可能会游泳……但开玩笑吧，不，我不会。这么长时间以来，伊娃一直是我生活的重要组成部分……说实话，没有她的生活有点可怕。”

"I understand. We're both such heavy products of ourupbringings though, I wonder what you would have been likewithout project E."  
“我理解。不过我们都是成长过程中的沉重产物，我想知道如果没有E计划，你会是什么样子。”

"Well what do you think you would have been like?"  
“那你觉得你会是什么样子？”

"I think I would have been more like Touji and Kensuke... orsomewhere between the two. Its hard to know for sure though, Ihave no idea what father would have been like if mother hadn'tdied."  
“我想我会更像东司和健介……或者介于两者之间。不过很难确定，我不知道如果母亲没有死，父亲会是什么样子。”

"So you would have been a little pervert like the other twostooges then?" she said with a grin.  
“那么你就会像其他两个傀儡一样有点变态了？”她笑着说道。

Shinji chuckled, then spit out some water that had gotten in hismouth, "Maybe... like I said it's hard to tell. I might have turnedout an even bigger introvert than I am. I just don't know"  
真嗣笑了笑，然后吐掉了嘴里的水，“也许……就像我说的很难说。我可能会变得比现在更内向。我只是不知道”

"Maybe its better to concentrate on what is than what mighthave been," Asuka said softly as they climbed to the shore.  
“也许专注于现在的事情比专注于可能的事情更好，”当他们爬上岸时，明日香轻声说道。

---

They opted to compromise for the rest of the project. Theactual pulling down of the MP Evas would be done from land (ittook them weeks to collect enough rope and wire) they didhowever use another tugboat to pull the Evas outside the bay.They both agreed that it made things that much more scenic.  
他们选择对项目的其余部分进行妥协。实际将 MP Evas 拉下来是从陆地上完成的（他们花了几周时间收集足够的绳索和金属丝），但他们使用了另一艘拖船将 Evas 拖出海湾。他们都同意这让事情变得更加美丽。

Asuka's injuries were slowly clearing up. She was nowwearing a sling on her arm but her eye had finally healed enoughto where she no longer needed to keep it covered. That hadproduced a small crisis in itself. Whatever after effects the lanceof Longinus had caused, it had resulted in the pigmentation of hereye fading to almost nothing. Her left eye was now pale pink. Shecould see fine, but the first time she had caught a look at it, shehad wigged out, screaming how she was becoming 'the doll'.  
明日香的伤势正在慢慢痊愈。她现在手臂上戴着吊带，但她的眼睛终于痊愈了，不再需要遮盖它了。这本身就引发了一场小危机。无论朗基努斯的长枪造成什么后遗症，它都导致赫雷眼的色素沉着几乎消失殆尽。她的左眼现在呈淡粉色。她看得很清楚，但当她第一次看到它的时候，她就摇摇欲坠，尖叫着她如何变成了“洋娃娃”。

Shinji had finally calmed her down and told her it didn'tmatter and it might not be permanent. Then to both their surprise,he actually chewed her out, telling her that Ayanami was theclosest thing he'd ever had to a sister and that he didn't think itwas becoming of her to insult someone who couldn't argue back.A bit taken aback by Shinji's small outburst, and realizing that shehad totally flown off the hook, she relaxed and started lookinginto finding some contact lenses. After few days passed howevershe soon stopped worrying about it, and Shinji was more or lesssure she would completely forget it in time.  
真嗣终于让她平静下来，告诉她这没关系，而且可能不会是永久性的。然后令他们两人惊讶的是，他竟然斥责了她，告诉她绫波是他所拥有的最亲密的姐妹，他认为她不应该侮辱一个无法反驳的人。真嗣的小爆发让她吃了一惊，意识到自己已经完全摆脱了困境，她放松下来，开始寻找隐形眼镜。然而几天过去了，她很快就不再担心这件事了，真嗣或多或少确信她很快就会完全忘记这件事。

It wasn't too long after that when Asuka began picking up onShinji starting to say strange things. Stuff about how she wouldn'tneed his help much longer, and how things would be muchquieter after that. It was almost as if he was implying he wouldn'tbe around.  
不久之后，明日香开始注意到真嗣开始说一些奇怪的话。关于她如何不再需要他的帮助以及此后事情会如何安静得多的事情。就好像他在暗示他不会在场一样。

As stubborn as Asuka was it finally did sink in that he mightbe serious, and that began to hit her harder and harder each timehe dropped a hint. She was realizing slowly that she didn't wanthim to leave. And it was just as frightening as the thought of hisstaying  
尽管明日香很固执，但她最终还是意识到他可能是认真的，而每当他提出暗示时，她的打击就开始越来越大。她慢慢地意识到，她不想让他离开。这和他留下来的想法一样令人恐惧

---

"Comeon Soyru, don't be a coward," Asuka told herself for thetenth time that hour.  
“来吧，Soyru，别做胆小鬼，”明日香这一个小时第十次告诉自己。

She was pacing a circle in her room and muttering under herbreath. Try as she might she couldn't work up the nerve to gooutside and just say it. She had come to the conclusion that shehad to do something to convince him to stay. After about half asecond she settled on appealing to his hormones. About threeseconds after that she realized what a hypocrite she would seemlike if she tried it.  
她在房间里来回踱步，小声嘀咕着。尽管她尽了最大的努力，但还是没能鼓起勇气到外面去说出来。她得出的结论是，她必须做点什么来说服他留下来。大约半秒钟后，她决定利用他的荷尔蒙。大约三秒钟后，她意识到如果她尝试这样做，她会显得多么伪善。

On one hand it was perfectly logical; after all they were theonly two people in the city, possibly the whole world. It madesense that they should at least make an effort to try to have morethan a 'friends' relationship. In all honesty she had expected Shinjito suggest it, wasn't it normal for they boy to be the forward onewith these things?  
一方面这是完全合乎逻辑的；另一方面也是如此。毕竟，他们是这个城市，甚至可能是整个世界，仅有的两个人。他们至少应该努力尝试建立不仅仅是“朋友”的关系，这是有道理的。说实话，她早就料到进司会这么建议，他们这小子在这些事情上走在前面不是很正常吗？

Then again this was Shinji she was thinking about. For himtaking the initiative was, to put it politely, rare. So the duty restedon her shoulders.  
话又说回来，她想到的就是真嗣。对他来说，主动采取主动，客气地说，是很少见的。所以这个责任就落在了她的肩上。

So why was she so nervous?  
那她为什么这么紧张呢？

'Because you're afraid,' She thought to herself angrily.  
“因为你害怕。”她愤怒地想。

But of what? 但什么？

Of Shinji?

The idea was almost laughable, he went so far out of his waynot to hurt other people she sometimes had suspected him ofbeing a masochist.  
这个想法几乎是可笑的，他如此不遗余力地不伤害别人，她有时怀疑他是一个受虐狂。

No that wasn't it... it was the other side of her problem. Thefact that she was afraid of being turned down.  
不，不是这样……这是她问题的另一面。事实上她害怕被拒绝。

Of being rejected. 被拒绝的感觉。

Of being alone. 独自一人。

God knew she had given him enough reason. She was afraid ifshe went out there and told him something like this he wouldthink she was making fun of him and turn away.  
天知道她已经给了他足够的理由。她担心如果她出去告诉他这样的事情，他会认为她在取笑他并转身走开。

Like the time with the kiss.  
就像那次接吻的时候。

She had handled that poorly, she knew. What had he thoughtof her after that? She had run to the bathroom and hit themouthwash so fast that she was sure he had been hurt... and shehad meant it at the time. She had actually blamed him for the factthat she had begun to enjoy the kiss. How dumb had that been ofher? Of all the stupid things to be angry with him about, that hadto be close to the top of the list. She guessed she had been moreangry with herself... she had felt as if she were betraying Kaji byenjoying the kiss of someone else.  
她知道，她处理得很糟糕。在那之后他对她有何看法？她跑到洗手间，用漱口水洗得如此之快，以至于她确信他受伤了……而且她当时是认真的。她实际上是因为她开始享受这个吻而责怪他的。她这么做是多么愚蠢啊？在所有对他生气的愚蠢事情中，这肯定是最重要的。她猜想她更生自己的气……她觉得自己享受别人的吻就背叛了加持。

And then Kaji had... with Misato...  
然后梶和美里……

"Why would he ever forgive me anyway-- he's right, all I everdid was make fun of him," she said as she leaned back against thewall. "I am such an idiot."  
“他为什么要原谅我——他是对的，我所做的一切就是取笑他，”她靠在墙上说道。 “我真是个白痴。”

---

Later that night she got up to get some of the bottled waterthey had found at the store when she heard a loud whimperingfrom Shinji's room. Curious, she slid the door open a bit andpeeked in. he was tangled in his sheets and tossing about as if hewere in pain.  
那天晚上晚些时候，她起身去拿一些他们在商店找到的瓶装水，这时她听到真嗣的房间里传来一声大声的呜咽声。她好奇地把门推开一点，往里看。他被床单缠住，翻来覆去，好像很痛苦。

Seeing someone having a nightmare can touch even the mostnon- empathic of people, and Shinji had been having them almostevery night since they had woken up. Asuka hurried in withoutthinking. His brow was soaked with sweat and his head turnedevery few seconds as he mumbled in his sleep.  
看到某人做噩梦，即使是最没有同理心的人也会被感动，自从他们醒来以来，真嗣几乎每天晚上都会做这样的梦。明日香想也没想就快步走了进去。他的额头已被汗水浸湿，他的头每隔几秒就转动一下，在睡梦中咕哝着。

From the few phrases she could make out, she knew that therewas no chance of the dream being anything less than horrifying.Kneeling beside his bed she placed a hand on his forehead, takingone of his hands in her other.  
从她能听出的几句话来看，她知道这个梦绝对是令人恐惧的。她跪在他的床边，将一只手放在他的额头上，另一只手握住他的手。

She had hoped her presence would somehow calm him, but asshe sat there his mumbling grew louder and clearer. Finally with ascream he practically flew awake.  
她原本希望她的出现能让他平静下来，但当她坐在那里时，他的咕哝声变得越来越响亮、越来越清晰。最后，随着一声尖叫，他几乎惊醒了。

"FATHER NO!"

This succeeded in frightening both of them silly.  
这成功的把两人都吓傻了。

"Shinji! Calm down it was just a dream!" Asuka said- taking holdof his hand as he tried to scramble back.  
“真嗣！冷静点，这只是个梦！”飞鸟说道——握住他的手，试图向后退去。

He finally seemed to see her and his breathing slowed slightly.And he gave her hand a small squeeze to acknowledge he hadheard her.  
他似乎终于看到了她，呼吸稍稍放慢了。他轻轻捏了一下她的手，表示他听到了她的声音。

"Are you okay now?" she asked with genuine concern.  
“你现在还好吗？”她真诚地关切地问道。

"I don't think I'll ever be alright," He said quietly.  
“我想我永远不会好起来。”他平静地说。

"What kind of talk is that?"  
“那是什么样的谈话？”

"I remember more of it now."  
“我现在记得更多了。”

"Remember what?" “记得什么？”

"Instrumentality."

"Y-you mean third impact?"

"Yeah. Get some sleep, I'll tell you in the morning..."  
“嗯。你先睡吧，明天早上我再告诉你……”

"No need to wait, I don't think I could get back to sleep if Itried."  
“不用等，我想如果再尝试的话我也睡不着。”

"Alright... hey Asuka?" “好吧……嘿，明日香？”

"Yes?"

"Thank you." “谢谢。”

---

Over the next few hours he told her what he could explainfrom his strange experience in the eye of the storm that had beenthird impact. It was a bit of a shock to find out that some of thethings she had though had been a fever dream from the pain hadbeen real.  
在接下来的几个小时里，他告诉她他在第三次撞击的风暴中心的奇怪经历可以解释什么。当她发现她因痛苦而做的一些发烧梦竟然是真实的时，我感到有点震惊。

"Are you saying that he did all that to be with your momagain?" Asuka asked in surprise.  
“你是说他做这一切都是为了再次和你妈妈在一起吗？”明日香惊讶地问道。

"As near as I can tell, yes. That was the impression I got."  
“据我所知，是的。这就是我的印象。”

"But... what makes him think she could forgive what he did toyou, me and Rei? Or all those other people he cast aside?"  
“但是……是什么让他认为她可以原谅他对你、我和丽所做的一切？或者所有其他被他抛弃的人？”

"I don't know... I don't know what he would have done; it's alllike a whirlwind in my head, some things are clearer than others. Iremember seeing you Rei and Misato, my mother and everyoneelse, I remember choosing to come back... but the rest is just bitsand pieces. I may never understand the whole thing. Maybe mymind just isn't wired to handle all that information. I think Iunderstand my father better now-- but... I still can't forgive him."  
“我不知道……我不知道他会做什么；这一切就像一阵旋风在我的脑海中盘旋，有些事情比其他事情更清楚。我记得看到你们，Rei和Misato，我的母亲和其他人，我记得选择回来……但剩下的只是一些碎片。也许我的头脑无法处理所有这些信息——但是……我仍然。无法原谅他。”

'Everyone he knew has hurt him... even me,' She thought toherself, 'Why did he choose to come back? What gave him thecourage to chose to come back to this? Could I have done thesame?'  
“他认识的每个人都伤害过他……甚至是我，”她心里想，“他为什么选择回来？”是什么让他有勇气选择重新回到这里？我也可以这么做吗？

[I don't want to die!]  
【我不想死！】

'I did do the same...' she realized with a start.  
“我也做了同样的事……”她吃了一惊。

"Asuka..." Shinji said hesitantly.  
“明日香……”真嗣犹豫着说道。

"Hmm?"

"I don't know why no one else came back... while I was withLilith someone told me that if they chose to that people couldreturn from the LCL, but even if that wasn't a lie... I'm glad you'rehere."  
“我不知道为什么没有其他人回来......当我和莉莉丝在一起时，有人告诉我，如果他们选择的话，人们可以从拼箱中返回，但即使这不是谎言......我很高兴你在这里。”

She didn't know what to say. She didn't know if she could sayanything. He had just said something that had touched her sodeeply that she was in a state of shock. What did he mean by that?Even if people did come back... he was still glad to be with her?But didn't he want to leave? What was he saying?  
她不知道该说什么。她不知道自己是否还能说些什么。他刚刚说了一句话，让她触动很深，让她震惊不已。他这是什么意思？就算人回来了……他还是很高兴和她在一起？但他不是想离开吗？他说什么？

She realized her hands were shaking.  
她发现自己的手在颤抖。

'Am I really that nervous?' she thought 'does it actuallyfrighten me that he likes me despite everything I've done to him?'  
“我真的那么紧张吗？”她想，“尽管我对他做了一切，他还是喜欢我，这真的让我感到害怕吗？”

"Asuka? Are you ok?" Shinji said with a distinct waver in hisvoice.  
“明日香？你还好吗？”真嗣的声音带着明显的颤抖说道。

'You moron! Say something or he's going to think you're madat him!' her inner voice screamed at her. 'He's giving you thechance you were to frightened to take!'  
'你个白痴！说点什么，不然他会认为你生他的气了！”她内心的声音对她尖叫。 “他给了你一个你不敢抓住的机会！”

But instead of opening her heart and telling him she wantedhim to stay, she shouted out at him as she always had.  
但她没有敞开心扉告诉他她希望他留下来，而是像往常一样对他大喊大叫。

"Of course I'm okay you idiot!"  
“我当然没问题，你这个白痴！”

She tried to stop it from leaving her lips but she couldn't.Whether it was just conditioned reflex or fear she didn't know.She tried to stumble her way through an apology but before shecould speak the dark look that had appeared on his face severaltimes since the night on the beach came back. He gave a little nodof the head as if to indicate acceptance of something and thenwithout a word he walked out the door  
她试图阻止它离开嘴唇，但她做不到。她不知道这只是条件反射还是恐惧。她试图结结巴巴地道歉，但还没等她开口，他脸上就出现了阴沉的表情。自从那天晚上在海滩回来后，我已经好几次面对这个问题了。他轻轻点了点头，仿佛表示接受某件事，然后一言不发地走出了门。

"Asuka you dummkopf!" she said finally as she got up to goafter him.  
“明日香你个笨蛋！”她站起来追赶他，最后说道。

---

She didn't find him in the apartment next door or on the roof.After checking the hill where they had placed the water tank acold fear swept over her and she ran down the path to the beach.  
她在隔壁的公寓或屋顶上都没有找到他。检查完他们放置水箱的山后，一阵恐惧席卷了她，她沿着小路跑向海滩。

She saw him standing just past the edge of the water lookingout in the bay. And in one terrible moment came to the conclusionthat he was going to go out there and drown himself. Screamingprotests at the top of her lungs she tore down the beach towardhim.  
她看到他站在水边，眺望着海湾。在一个可怕的时刻，他得出了一个结论：他要出去淹死自己。她用尽全力尖叫抗议，把海滩撕向他。

He heard her and looked up with a confused expression for amoment before looking back out. A cold chill spread throughouther as she doubled her pace.  
他听到了她的声音，抬起头，表情困惑地看了一会儿，然后又往外看。一股寒意蔓延全身，她加快了脚步。

Whatever he might have been expecting, her slammingheadlong into him had not even been on the list.  
不管他在期待什么，她猛烈地撞向他的举动根本不在名单上。

Knocking them both over into the shallow tidewater Asukaquickly began dragging a soaked and sputtering Shinji away fromthe water.  
明日香把他们俩都撞到了浅滩上，然后迅速把浑身湿透、溅起水花的真嗣拖离了水面。

"Asuka!" he shouted as he spit and coughed the saltwaterfrom his mouth, "what the hell are you doing?"  
“明日香！”他一边吐口水，一边咳出嘴里的咸水，大喊道：“你到底在做什么？”

He was about to yell some more when he saw her face. He hadseen her get upset many times, but he had never seen her like this.  
当他看到她的脸时，他正想大声喊叫。他见过她生气很多次，但从来没有见过她这样。

Was this... fear? 这是……恐惧吗？

For him?

As they reached the sand dunes, she finally let go andquickly began assaulting him with punches and kicks as shescreamed at him never to do anything like that again.  
当他们到达沙丘时，她终于松开了手，并迅速开始对他拳打脚踢，并尖叫着让他永远不要再做这样的事情。

"hold- ow! Hey! _wait_ a second! ... what did I do?"he yelled-- cutting her off in honest confusion.  
“等等！嘿！等一下！……我做了什么？”他喊道——以真诚的困惑打断了她的话。

"Don't play dumb with me Ikari, I'm not going to let you killyourself over something stupid like that!" she shouted at him.  
“碇别跟我装傻了，我不会让你因为这种蠢事而自杀的！”她对他喊道。

"What?" he shouted as his eyes widened in surprise, "k-killmyself? What the hell makes you think I'd do that?"  
“什么？”他惊讶地睁大了眼睛，大喊道，“自杀？你到底凭什么认为我会这么做？”

Seeing Asuka blush was a rare occurrence, and one that hehad witnessed only a half dozen times. Seeing her stumble overwords was something he had _never_ witnessed.  
看到明日香脸红的情况很少见，他只见过六次。看到她结结巴巴的言语是他从未见过的。

"I... well... I saw you... and you said you can't swim... with youby the water and all... so I thought," she trailed off as her facetook on a look he had never seen there before.  
“我……呃……我看到你了……你说你不会游泳……和你一起在水边……所以我想，”她的声音渐渐减弱，因为她的脸上露出了他的表情。以前从未见过那里。

Her voice dropped to a whisper and he couldn't hear what shesaid after that, but he brushed it off, intending to set the recordstraight before anything else happened.  
她的声音压得很低，他听不清她之后说了什么，但他没有理睬，打算在发生其他事情之前澄清事实。

"I wasn't going to kill myself Asuka. And I have no intentionof doing so. I didn't turn down what I did from Lilith to end it alllike that."  
“我并没有打算自杀，明日香。我也无意这样做。我没有拒绝莉莉丝所做的一切来结束这一切。”

Her eyes closed and she let out a sigh of relief. He decided itwas probably the best time to tell her the rest.  
她闭上眼睛，松了口气。他认为现在可能是告诉她剩下的事情的最佳时机。

"Your arm should be back up to speed in a week or two. Oncethat's done I'm going to leave."  
“你的手臂应该会在一两周内恢复正常速度。一旦完成，我就会离开。”

Her eyes opened and she gasped as her entire body tensed up.He had no idea how she was taking it, more than likely she wasrelived that she would no longer have to put up with him.  
她的眼睛睁开，整个身体都绷紧了，她喘着粗气。他不知道她是怎么接受的，很可能她松了口气，因为她不再需要忍受他了。

Much to his surprise she began to get upset.  
令他惊讶的是，她开始变得心烦意乱。

"W-what?"

"I'm going to go maybe as far as Okinawa... I dunno. You haveenough food stocked to last a year, and enough seeds to start agarden of just about anything you'd ever want."  
“我可能会去冲绳……我不知道。你有足够的食物储备来维持一年，还有足够的种子来建造一个花园，里面有你想要的任何东西。”

"But... why?" she asked, her tone and face still unreadable  
“但为什么？”她问道，语气和表情仍然让人难以捉摸

He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. This was it...  
他闭上眼睛，深吸了一口气。就是这个...

"Because I can't keep going on like it is between us," he toldher as she froze in place, "I can't keep living like this when everyinsult is like a knife in my gut. Every time you scream at me forjust being nice is a turn of that knife... and it's tearing me apart. Idon't know exactly when or why it happened but I care about youAsuka. I know I never said anything, probably because I wasafraid you'd just laugh."  
“因为我不能像我们之间那样继续下去，”当她僵在原地时，他告诉她，“每次侮辱都像一把刀插在我的肚子上，我不能继续这样生活。每次你因为正义而对我尖叫时，我不能继续这样生活。”友善就是那把刀的转折……我不知道它是什么时候或为什么发生的，但我关心你明日香，我知道我什么也没说，可能是因为我害怕你会笑。 ”

Was it his imagination or was she trembling?  
到底是他的幻觉，还是她的颤抖？

[Hmmm not much to look at] [You little pervert!] [Oh him? He'sboring] [What are you stupid?] [Such a boring little boy] [StupidShinji] [Afraid to kiss a girl on the anniversary of you momsdeath? Is she watching you from up in heaven?] [That's becauseyou kissed me you jerk] [He wouldn't know how to relate toanother person if you gave him a manual] [I hate you! I hateeverything!]  
【嗯，没什么好看的】【你这个小色狼！】【哦他？他很无聊] [你傻什么？] [真是个无聊的小男孩] [愚蠢的真嗣] [害怕在你妈妈去世的周年纪念日亲吻一个女孩？她是在天堂看着你吗？] [那是因为你吻了我，你这个混蛋] [如果你给他一本手册，他就不知道如何与另一个人相处] [我恨你！我讨厌一切！]

It hit her all at once. A wave of insults that she had so casuallythrown out over the months they had lived together. A burningwall of anger she'd placed in front of her to drive away anythingthat might hurt. A wall that kept anything that might help out aswell. She saw in a painful crushing burst of insight how she musthave seemed to everyone. How she must have seemed to Shinji.  
这一下子击中了她。他们一起生活的几个月里，她随意地抛出了一波侮辱。她在自己面前放置了一堵愤怒的火墙，以赶走任何可能伤害的东西。一堵墙，里面放着任何可能有帮助的东西。她在痛苦的、毁灭性的洞察力中看到了她在每个人眼中的样子。在真嗣看来，她一定是这样的。

"S-Shinji... I," she started to say as the tears tried to come, "I...oh Gott I'm sorry!" she reached out and grasped his shirt with herfree hand. She leaned up against him and looked in his eyespleadingly.  
“真、真嗣……我，”她开始说，泪水快要流出来了，“我……哦天哪，我很抱歉！”她伸出手，用空着的那只手抓住了他的衬衫。她靠在他身上，恳求地看着他的眼睛。

"Don't go, don't leave me alone," She said in a small voice. "Italmost killed me when I saw you at the water and I thought...Shinji... please don't run away from me."  
“别走，别丢下我一个人。”她小声说道。 “当我在水边看到你时，我几乎要了命，我想……真嗣……请不要逃离我。”

---

Shinji's head was in a whirl. He resolved himself then andthere never to assume again what was going on in her mind everagain. Her admission that she didn't want him to go had angeredhim for a moment, but just as quickly as it came it fled in thewake of memory. He thought back to his time spent trapped inUnit 01 and the similar imprisonment in the 12th angel. Mostimportantly he thought to his choice while inside Lilith. It hadtaken loosing everyone he cared for and almost loosing his life torealize their importance to him. Before that moment he hadthought his own existence pointless, and had even craved death. Ithad been only at the last moment when he realized the truth andhad fought his way back. The old saying was true after all, younever know what you have until its taken away.  
真嗣的脑子一片混乱。他当时就下定决心，永远不再假设她脑子里在想什么。她承认自己不想让他走，这让他一时感到愤怒，但很快，他就在记忆中消失了。他回想起自己被困在01号部队的时光，以及在第12天使号中类似的监禁经历。最重要的是，他在莉莉丝体内思考了自己的选择。他失去了所有他关心的人，几乎失去了自己的生命，才意识到他们对他的重要性。在那之前，他认为自己的存在毫无意义，甚至渴望死亡。直到最后一刻，他才意识到真相，并奋力反击。这句老话果然是对的，在被夺走之前，你永远不知道自己拥有什么。

But it was those last words Asuka had spoken that struck himthe hardest… he had been about to do just that.  
但最让他震惊的是明日香所说的最后一句话……他正打算这么做。

Run away... again. 再次逃跑。

He was suddenly disgusted with himself, he should haverealized long ago that the pain had been part of his choice. If hecouldn't stand up to it then the entire choice, his choice to exist atall was for nothing.  
他突然对自己感到厌恶，他早就该意识到痛苦是他选择的一部分。如果他无法承受，那么他的整个选择，他存在的选择就都是徒劳的。

"Asuka," He said as he turned her face to his and looked her inthe eyes, "If you want me to stay... I will."  
“明日香，”他把她的脸转向自己，看着她的眼睛，“如果你想让我留下来……我会的。”

'I must be insane,' he thought privately.  
“我一定是疯了，”他私下想。

---

A thought floated up in her mind like a half-remembereddream.  
一个念头如梦似幻地在她脑海中浮现。

[If you want me... all you have to do is be nice to me]  
【如果你想要我……你只要对我好一点就好】

Was that something he had told her? Or something sheimagined he had said? She couldn't remember... But it wasdefinitely something he might have said  
这是他告诉她的吗？或者她想象他说过什么？她不记得了……但这绝对是他可能说过的话

"I don't mean to be such a bitch," She said softly, suddenlyunable to look him in they eye.  
“我不想成为这样一个婊子。”她轻声说道，突然不敢直视他的眼睛。

He was quit for a moment before he answered.  
他沉默了一会儿才回答。

"I don't think I've been behaving much better. I shouldn'tignore you like I have been."  
“我觉得我的表现并没有好多少。我不应该像以前那样忽视你。”

"What a pathetic couple we make..." she said looking down atthe soft white sand, "Our parents did a spectacular job of makingsure our social lives would suck."  
“我们是多么可怜的一对啊……”她低头看着柔软的白色沙滩说道，“我们的父母做了一件了不起的工作，让我们的社交生活变得很糟糕。”

"Parents? Wait, what about..." Shinji started to say beforerealizing just how little he knew about Asuka's past.  
“父母？等等，那……”真嗣开口说道，然后才意识到自己对明日香的过去知之甚少。

"That's not something I can talk about easily Shinji... I'll tellyou another time. For now let's just say your father didn't have amonopoly on bad parenting skills."  
“这不是我可以轻易谈论的事情，真嗣……我下次再告诉你。现在我们只能说，你的父亲并没有垄断不良的养育技巧。”

Shinji nodded then climbed to his feet and helped Asuka dothe same.  
真嗣点点头，然后站起来，帮助明日香也这么做。

"I know we don't get along well most the time Asuka," hesaid, "but I am willing to try if you are."  
“我知道我们大多数时候相处得不好，明日香，”他说，“但如果你相处得好的话，我愿意尝试。”

"Stranger things have happened."  
“更奇怪的事情发生了。”

---

Three days later at Asuka's request they made their way up tothe foothills where Shinji had once spend days wandering afterhis battle with the fourth angel. They walked for hours beforethey finally passed the bus stop that was one of the few landmarksShinji remembered from his long ago trip.  
三天后，在明日香的要求下，他们登上了山麓，真嗣在与第四位天使战斗后曾在那里徘徊了几天。他们走了几个小时才终于经过了公交车站，这是真嗣在他很久以前的旅行中记得的少数地标之一。

As they took a break beside a small stream, Shinji looked overat her and spoke up. "I don't know if it's still going to be thereAsuka."  
当他们在一条小溪边休息时，真嗣看了她一眼，开口说道。 “我不知道它是否还会在那里，明日香。”

"I know... it might have been destroyed in the blast. But...please, I need this."  
“我知道……它可能在爆炸中被毁了。但是……拜托，我需要这个。”

"I don't mind, I just wanted to warn you," he said reaching outand giving her hand a squeeze.  
“我不介意，我只是想警告你，”他说着伸出手捏了捏她的手。

She looked down at his hand and decided it wasn't worthanother fight. He was only trying to comfort her. Even a week agoshe would have slapped him for the contact, habit was notsomething that was broken easily. But now she was starting tounderstand him a little better and was fractionally less prone tothrowing fits.  
她低头看着他的手，觉得不值得再打了。他只是想安慰她而已。即使是在一周前，她也会因为这次接触而打他一巴掌，习惯不是那么容易打破的。但现在她开始更好地理解他了，也不太容易发脾气了。

They soon resumed their hike and a few hours later came totheir destination. It was a cliff over looking an entiremountainside of terraces! They stretched all across the side of thecliffs and around. Asuka was left speechless as she looked out atthe mist-covered hills surrounding her. She 'd never knownsomething this beautiful had existed anywhere near Tokyo Three.Back during the war, she might not have cared, but now it was allshe could do to take it all in.  
他们很快又继续徒步，几个小时后就到达了目的地。这是一个悬崖，可以俯瞰整座山的梯田！它们遍布悬崖的一侧和周围。明日香望着周围云雾缭绕的群山，无言以对。她从来不知道东京三号附近有这么美丽的东西。在战争期间，她可能不在乎，但现在她能做的就是接受这一切。

Asuka knelt beside the garden and slipped her backpack off asShinji watched silently. She reached inside the pack and removedseveral items including two dozen wooden boards, and a torn andbattered photograph of Misato Ritsuko and Kaji back in collage.Placing the photo aside for the moment, she began setting up whatsoon took the form of a small shrine and placed the various itemsinside. Finally she took the photo and set it inside and shut thedoor on the front of the newly constructed shrine.  
明日香跪在花园旁边，脱下背包，真嗣静静地看着。她把手伸进包里，取出几件物品，包括两打木板，还有一张拼贴画中的美里律子和梶治的撕破烂烂的照片。暂时把照片放在一边，她开始布置一个小神社的形状，并放置在上面。里面的各种物品。最后她拍了照片，把它放进去，关上了新建神社前面的门。

"I will always remember you, Kaji..." she whispered, "rest inpeace with those who you loved and who loved you."  
“我会永远记住你，加持……”她轻声说道，“与你所爱的人和爱你的人一起安息吧。”

---

They camped by a nearby pond that night. Rolling clouds letthe moon shine through in places, creating dramatic beams ofmoonlight. It was fascinating to watch the light play off the sidesand the remaining buildings.  
那天晚上，他们在附近的一个池塘边露营。滚滚的云彩让月亮透过某些地方，创造出引人注目的月光光束。看着灯光从侧面和剩余的建筑物上照射下来，真是令人着迷。

After hours of silence Asuka spoke up as they ate their dinner,"Thank you Shinji... I needed to do that."  
经过几个小时的沉默后，明日香在他们吃晚饭时开口说道：“谢谢真嗣……我需要这么做。”

"Your welcome, Asuka," he said somewhat distantly.  
“不客气，明日香。”他有些冷漠地说。

"What's wrong?"

"I... I miss Misato," Shinji said softly.

Asuka watched him for awhile and thought about that. He waslonely, that much was obvious. She knew the feeling far to well tomistake it. The question was; what could she do? Would he takeany offer for comfort seriously? Lord knew she had taunted himenough to make him doubt her honesty.  
明日香看了他一会儿，思考着这个问题。他很孤独，这是显而易见的。她太了解这种感觉了，绝对不会误会。问题是；她能做什么呢？他会认真对待任何安慰的提议吗？上帝知道她嘲笑他的程度足以让他怀疑她的诚实。

Perhaps it would be best if she mended one of the moreobvious bridges she had tried to burn over their time together.  
也许她最好修补其中一根在他们在一起的时光中她试图烧毁的更明显的桥梁。

She stood and walked over to him, then knelt down besidewhere he sat. Fighting to remain calm, she tapped him on theshoulder to get his attention. He looked up at her and she took adeep breath before leaning in to kiss him.  
她站起来，走到他身边，然后在他坐的地方跪了下来。她努力保持冷静，拍了拍他的肩膀以引起他的注意。他抬头看着她，她深吸了一口气，然后俯身吻了他。

It didn't go as planned.  
事情没有按计划进行。

Shinji's reflexes and mindset concerning Asuka had longbecome accustomed to ducking thwaps on the head and slaps tothe face. The unexpected movement towards him from hertriggered these reflexes and he instinctively jumped backwards tododge what he mistook to be an attack.  
真嗣对明日香的反应和心态早已习惯了躲开拍头、打耳光。她意外地朝他走来的动作触发了这些反射，他本能地向后跳去，以躲避他误以为是的攻击。

Asuka began to blush furiously as she turned away, andShinji's mind began to twist and turn as he attempted to figure outwhat the hell had just happened.  
明日香转过身去，脸开始变得通红，而真嗣的思绪开始扭曲，试图弄清楚刚刚到底发生了什么。

"Asuka?" he asked, his tone betraying his utter confusion.  
“明日香？”他问道，他的语气暴露了他完全的困惑。

"I'm sorry," she said "I was just trying to..." her voice trailedoff as she got up and walked back to where they were camped.  
“我很抱歉，”她说，“我只是想……”当她起身走回他们露营的地方时，她的声音逐渐减弱。

---

Was she trying to kiss me?  
她是想吻我吗？

Why did she do that?  
她为什么这么做？

Why did I freak out?  
为什么我吓坏了？

Well the last one was easier to answer, but as he realized thatshe had honestly been trying to kiss him he wanted to slaphimself for his reaction.  
好吧，最后一个更容易回答，但当他意识到她真的想吻他时，他想为自己的反应而打自己一巴掌。

'But what can I do?' He thought as he watched her sit downbeside the tent. 'I don't even begin to understand her. What if I didsomething wrong? What if I-'  
'但我能做什么呢？'他一边想着，一边看着她坐在帐篷旁边。 “我什至还没有开始理解她。如果我做错了什么怎么办？如果我-'

"Oh _enough_ of this already," He said aloud as he climbed tohis feet.  
“哦，已经够了，”他站起来时大声说道。

As he made his way to where she sat, an amusing memorycame to mind. Smiling, he locked the image in his mind's eye,took a deep breath, released it and muttered under his breath.  
当他走向她坐的地方时，脑海中浮现出一段有趣的回忆。他微笑着，将画面锁定在脑海中，深吸了一口气，又吐了出来，低声呢喃道。

"Target the center... pull the switch."  
“瞄准中心……拉动开关。”

---

"Hey Asuka," He said just loud enough to catch her attention,"wanna kiss me?"  
“嘿明日香，”他大声说道，足以引起她的注意，“想吻我吗？”

"Huh?" she said almost flinching at his voice.  
“嗯？”她对他的声音几乎感到畏缩。

"Kissing. You know, have you done it?" He continued as hetried to fight back the laughter that was threatening to break hisconcentration.  
“接吻。你知道吗，你接吻过吗？”他继续说道，试图强忍住那可能会分散他注意力的笑声。

She gave him a look that was part confusion, part annoyanceand part thankfulness. Shaking her head as if she couldn't believehe would possibly do something like this-- but too amused by hismove to stop him-- she decided to play along.  
她看了他一眼，一半是困惑，一半是烦恼，一半是感激。她摇摇头，仿佛不敢相信他会做这样的事——但又被他阻止他的举动逗乐了——她决定配合。

"Nuh-uh," She said as she held back a storm of laughterherself.  
“呃——呃，”她一边说，一边强忍住笑声。

"What's the matter?" Shinji asked playfully, "are you scared?"  
“怎么了？”真嗣俏皮地问道：“你害怕吗？”

"I'm not afraid, pucker up!" she managed to get throughdespite the giggles.  
“我不怕，撅起嘴！”尽管有咯咯的笑声，她还是设法度过了难关。

"Did you brush your teeth?" he asked in mock seriousness.  
“你刷牙了吗？”他假装严肃地问道。

That did it. 就这样做到了。

They couldn't stop it any longer. Both of them erupted intolaughter. For almost ten minutes they bot lay there on the groundgiggling and snickering like a couple of fifteen year olds.  
他们已经无法再阻止了。两人同时爆发出一阵大笑。他们躺在地上近十分钟，像一对十五岁的孩子一样咯咯地笑。

Finally when they managed to catch their breath they lay therebeside one another still grinning at the treetops.  
最后，当他们终于缓过气来时，他们并排躺在树顶上，仍然咧着嘴笑。

"I can't believe I actually said that," Asuka said after awhile. "Imust have sounded like such a little snot that day."  
“我不敢相信我真的这么说了，”过了一会儿明日香说道。 “那天我听起来一定像个小鼻涕。”

"Its ok, I must have looked like a scared rabbit."  
“没关系，我一定看起来像一只受惊的兔子。”

"Don't worry about it... hey, were you serious just now?"  
“别担心……喂，你刚才是认真的吗？”

"If you promise not to hold my nose, yeah."  
“如果你保证不捂住我的鼻子，那就好。”

"Dummkopf," she said with a smile "I promise if you can keepyour breath from tickling me."  
“笨蛋，”她微笑着说，“我保证你能控制住你的呼吸，别让我发痒。”

"That's absolutely fair enough," Shinji said as he rolled up to asitting position. Asuka did likewise and for a moment they lookedat one another with a combination of fear and longing.  
“这绝对是公平的，”真嗣一边说，一边坐到了座位上。明日香也这么做了，有那么一刻，他们面面相觑，心中既恐惧又渴望。

Finally Shinji leaned in and their lips met.  
最后，真嗣倾身过来，他们的嘴唇相遇了。

Neither of them would ever remember just how long they hadstayed like that. When they finally broke they both sat therelooking at one another and breathing heavily. Both of them wouldhave been shocked to know they were thinking the same thought.  
他们俩都不记得自己这样保持了多久。当他们终于崩溃时，他们都坐在那儿互相看着对方，喘着粗气。如果他们知道自己有同样的想法，一定会感到震惊。

'Where the hell did he/she learn to do THAT?'  
“他/她到底是在哪里学会这样做的？”

---

The next day as they made their way back to the apartment,Shinji began to think about what it would take for Asuka and heto tolerate one another long enough for any romance to evenbegin. He knew as well as she did just how difficult it was to getaround the wall they had built between them over their timetogether. To add to the problem they still knew virtually nothingabout one another despite all their time together.  
第二天，当他们回到公寓时，真嗣开始思考如何才能让明日香和他互相容忍足够长的时间，让浪漫开始。他和她一样清楚，要绕过他们在一起的时间里在他们之间筑起的墙是多么困难。更糟糕的是，尽管他们在一起很长时间，但他们对彼此几乎一无所知。

He decided to take the first step to solve that.  
他决定迈出第一步来解决这个问题。

"When I was five," he started to say as they walked down theroad, "after my mom was taken into Eva... my father fostered meout to my Uncle. I didn't mind at first, father had been angry andvery touchy after that day and I was grateful for a chance to beaway from that... but after awhile I began to miss him. I only sawhim once a year when my Uncle would take me to Mother'sgrave. Even then he was cold and harsh, like anything that mighthave once mattered to him was gone forever... and in a way Isuppose it was. The next few years I began to grow angry becauseI felt he wanted to be rid of me, that he didn't want me at all, andevery time we met he would barely even acknowledge myexistence. Finally one year I couldn't take it any more and Iturned and ran from him-- telling him I never wanted to see himagain. That was just over three years ago."  
“当我五岁的时候，”当他们走在路上时，他开始说道，“在我妈妈被带到伊娃那里之后......我父亲把我寄养给我叔叔。一开始我并不介意，父亲一直很生气而且非常敏感。那天之后，我很庆幸有机会摆脱这个……但过了一段时间，我开始想念他，每年我叔叔都会带我去母亲的坟墓，但那时他还是冷漠而严厉的。 ，就像任何曾经对他来说重要的事情都永远消失了……在某种程度上，我想是这样。 接下来的几年我开始生气，因为我觉得他想摆脱我，他不希望我这么做。所有，每次我们见面，他都几乎不承认我的存在。最后一年，我再也受不了了，我转身逃离了他——告诉他我再也不想见到他了。”

"Did he ever write or anything?" Asuka asked after a shortsilence.  
“他写过书吗？”短暂的沉默后，明日香问道。

"No... the only contact I had with him after that was thepackage in the mail and the phone call for me to report to Tokyo3. When I arrived the third angel was attacking and they took mestraight to the Geofront. When I saw my father again... and Irealized the only reason he called me back was to pilot the Eva Iturned away. I would have left then and there if they hadn'tbrought Rei out on the stretcher. You heard about the incidentwith unit 00? She was so badly injured that she couldn't evenstand up. A blast shook the Geofront and knocked us all around,spilling Rei on the floor. I ran over and saw how badly she washurt... And told them I would pilot. They had to shame me intothe damned thing."  
“不……此后我与他唯一的联系就是邮件中的包裹和让我向东京报告的电话。当我到达时，第三天使正在攻击，他们直接把我带到了 Geofront。当我看到我的爸爸又来了……我意识到他叫我回来的唯一原因是驾驶伊娃，如果他们没有用担架把丽带出来，我就会离开。你听说过00号部队的事件吗？伤势严重，她甚至无法站起来。爆炸震动了地面，把我们都撞到了，我跑过去，看到她伤得有多严重……并告诉他们我必须驾驶。羞辱我，让我陷入这该死的事情。”

Asuka watched him speak in silence. She had only known bitsand pieces of these events, and none of what had convinced himto pilot.  
明日香看着他沉默地说话。她只知道这些事件的一些零碎信息，但没有一个能说服他驾驶。

"I never wanted to do it Asuka... every time I climbed intothat... that thing it seemed like someone was getting hurt, eitherme or Rei or my friends or even you... it was tearing me apart andI couldn't stop it. I was afraid for myself as well... all the times Iwas hurt, all the pain... it all just kept adding up. I don't know ifthat's normal or just cowardly, but I was terrified of the pain."  
“我从来不想这么做，明日香……每次我爬进那个……那个东西似乎有人受伤了，要么是我，要么是丽，要么是我的朋友，甚至是你……它让我心碎，但我不能别再这样了，我也为自己担心……每次我都受伤了，所有的痛苦……我不知道这是正常的还是只是懦弱，但我害怕痛苦。 ”。

"Why are you telling me this?"  
“你为什么要告诉我这个？”

"Because I want you to understand what it was like for me...I'm not trying to make excuses though, I know how I acted mostof the time and I am ashamed."  
“因为我想让你明白我的感受……不过我并不是想找借口，我知道我大多数时候的表现，我很羞愧。”

"Ashamed of what? You were a damn good pilot when youactually got your ass in gear."  
“羞什么？当你真正开始工作时，你就是一名非常出色的飞行员。”

"How much do you know about what happened just after thefourth angel?"  
“关于第四位天使之后发生的事情，你知道多少？”

"Not much, just that you almost left Nerv."  
“没什么，只是你差点就离开Nerv了。”

"I ran away."

" . . . "

"I spent a couple of days just wandering the city and thecountryside before Section Two found me-- not to far from wherewe camped last night, actually. I still almost left... I would have ifTouji and Kensuke hadn't shown up at the train station. I think Irealized that, for the first time I could remember, I had peoplewho cared about me, that I had friends... and with Misatosomething like a family. For the first time in my life I felt like Ihad a real home."  
“在第二组找到我之前，我在城市和乡村闲逛了几天——实际上，离我们昨晚露营的地方不远。我还差一点就离开了……如果东司和健介没有出现的话，我就会离开。”我想我第一次意识到，我有关心我的人，我有朋友……而且我有生以来第一次感觉到我有一个家庭。真正的家。”

---

Asuka thought about that for the rest of their trip back. Oncethey were home and cleaned, she went out and found him on thebalcony. He was sitting on one of the patio chairs with his SDATplaying and watching the sky as the sunset faded.  
明日香在接下来的旅途中一直在思考这个问题。他们到家并打扫干净后，她出去发现他在阳台上。他坐在露台的一张椅子上，一边玩着 SDAT，一边看着夕阳西下的天空。

She sat down on the chair beside him and waited for him tocome out of his thoughts. Finally the tape ended and he blinkedhis eyes as he woke up from whatever meditations he had been in.  
她在他身边的椅子上坐下，等待他从思绪中回过神来。最后，磁带结束了，他眨了眨眼睛，从刚才的冥想中醒来。

"Oh, good evening Asuka, I didn't see you come outside," hesaid with a smile.  
“哦，晚上好，明日香，我没有看到你出来，”他微笑着说道。

She was struck then by just how handsome he was going to bewhen he grew older. Knowing what she did now about Rei andYui Ikari, she could see the resemblance clearly. He had hismother's eyes. His father's features were there as well but theirharshness was tempered by Shinji's own gentle nature. She, forwhat might have been the first time, saw the man hiding withinthe boy.  
当时她对他长大后会变得多么英俊感到震惊。知道她现在对丽和碇唯做了什么，她可以清楚地看到相似之处。他有他母亲的眼睛。他父亲的特征也在那里，但他们的严厉被真嗣自己温柔的本性所缓和。她，这可能是第一次，看到男孩体内藏着的男人。

She reached out and took his hand, noticing with relief that hedidn't shrink back from her touch this time. Instead he hesitated amoment before returning her gentle grip.  
她伸出手握住他的手，欣慰地发现他这次没有在她的碰触面前退缩。相反，他犹豫了一会儿，才放回她温柔的握力。

She wasn't able to begin right away, she had spent so muchtime and effort forgetting these things that just remembering themwas painful. But after several false starts she finally began to tellShinji about her own mother and what had happened after theexperiment with Unit 02. As she reached the end the tears beganto flow freely and for the first time since she was a small child…she let them come without fighting them off.  
她无法立即开始，她花了太多的时间和精力来忘记这些事情，只是记住它们就很痛苦。但在几次错误的开始之后，她终于开始告诉真嗣关于她自己的母亲以及在02号实验后发生的事情。当她到达最后时，泪水开始自由地流淌，这是她从小以来第一次……她让它们流出来。而不与他们战斗。

Shinji slowly reached out to her and pulled her closer. Itsurprised her that it felt good to accept his comfort. It had beensomething she had actually feared for a long time. She realizedthat it was because he didn't merely pity her, he honestlyunderstood her pain, and wanted to take some of it away if shewould let him.  
真嗣慢慢地向她伸出手，将她拉近。让她惊讶的是，接受他的安慰感觉很好。这实际上是她长期以来一直担心的事情。她意识到，这是因为他不仅仅是怜悯她，他真诚地理解她的痛苦，如果她愿意的话，他想带走一些痛苦。

They sat there for almost an hour just holding one another;neither wanting to break whatever spell had finally allowed themto finally connect so deeply.  
他们就这么抱着彼此坐了将近一个小时；谁都不想打破最终让他们如此深入地联系在一起的咒语。

Finally, both of them physically and mentally exhausted, theyfell asleep.  
最后，两人身心俱疲，都睡着了。

---

She awoke in the middle of the night to find herself stillwrapped in Shinji's arms. She was so comfortable that she forgotall about yelling at him for touching her. Instead she snuggled upcloser to him, placing her head against his chest, sharing hiswarmth. She looked up at his face where a gentle smile had takenresident.  
半夜醒来，她发现自己还被真嗣抱在怀里。她是如此舒服，以至于忘记了因他碰她而对他大喊大叫。相反，她依偎在他身边，把头靠在他的胸口，分享他的温暖。她抬头看着他的脸，脸上露出了温柔的微笑。

After almost two months of nightmares he seemed to finally besleeping in peace. She wondered if it was because of her,although even as she thought that she knew it was a conceitedidea.  
经过近两个月的噩梦后，他似乎终于安然入睡了。她想知道这是否是因为她，尽管她认为她知道这是一个自负的想法。

As she pondered this she realized how long it had been sincethey'd had an argument. It had been several days at least. Severaldays without hurting one another, without the anger and fear.  
想到这里，她意识到他们已经有多久没有吵架了。至少已经好几天了。好几天没有互相伤害，没有愤怒和恐惧。

Was this real? Had they both changed so much?  
这是真的吗？两人的变化都这么大吗？

It was possible... people were known to sometimes changeafter traumatic events, her own mother had gone from a lovingand giving woman to an uncaring suicidal psychopath after heraccident. Who was to say that a change for the better wasimpossible?  
这是有可能的……众所周知，人们有时会在经历创伤事件后发生改变，她自己的母亲在事故发生后从一个充满爱心和奉献精神的女人变成了一个冷漠的自杀精神病患者。谁说改变是不可能的？

Even weeks ago she would have never pictured the two ofthem like this. Now as she lay there feeling the heat from his bodyshe was angry with herself for avoiding this type of closeness forso long. How much easier would everything have been had theybonded like this from the beginning? What would it have all beenlike? How much pain and misery would have been avoided?  
即使是几周前，她也绝不会想象他们两个是这样的。现在，当她躺在那里感受到他身体的热量时，她对自己很生气，因为她这么长时间都在逃避这种亲密关系。如果他们从一开始就这样结合在一起，一切会容易得多吗？一切会是什么样子？可以避免多少痛苦和苦难？

As she thought of these things her hands involuntarilyclenched tighter on Shinji's clothes, causing him to stir from hisslumber. After a moment's disorientation, he relaxed and lookeddown at Asuka who was wearing an expression of deep thought.  
想到这些，她的手不由自主地攥紧了真嗣的衣服，把他从睡梦中惊醒。一阵迷茫后，他放松下来，低头看着一脸沉思的明日香。

"A yen for your thoughts?" he asked, surprising her by beingawake.  
“你的想法需要日元吗？”他问，让她惊讶的是他居然醒了。

"I thought the line was 'penny'?"  
“我以为这句话是‘便士’？”

"True, but I have no idea what the exchange rate would be...not that it even maters anymore. But seriously, what were youthinking about? You seemed a bit upset."  
“是的，但我不知道汇率会是多少……甚至不再重要了。但是说真的，你在想什么？你看起来有点不安。”

"I was wondering how things would have turned out if we hadput all this crap behind us sooner."  
“我想知道如果我们早点把这些废话抛在脑后，事情会变成什么样子。”

"Asuka... you said this before, but there's no point in worryingabout 'what ifs'. Doing that will only hurt in the long run.Wondering 'what if I had done this' or 'if I had said that'. Regretslike that can drive you to the edge, then so far past it you feel likethere's no way back. We both screwed up a lot, we all did... butobsessing about it will accomplish nothing."  
“明日香……你之前说过，但担心‘如果’是没有意义的。这样做从长远来看只会带来伤害。想知道‘如果我这样做了’或‘如果我那样说了’会怎么样。后悔之类的这会把你逼到边缘，然后过了那么远，你会觉得没有回头路，我们都搞砸了，我们都做过……但沉迷于它不会有任何结果。”

"You should have been a shrink," Asuka said with a laugh.  
“你应该当一名心理医生，”明日香笑着说。

"What's a 'shrink'?"

"Oh, sorry, its American slang for a psychiatrist, I think theterm came from someone calling them witch doctors and head-shrinkers or something like that."  
“哦，抱歉，这是美国俚语中对精神科医生的称呼，我想这个词来自于称呼他们为巫医、缩头师之类的人。”

"Oh... well I was just speaking from experience. Hey, can I askyou something?"  
“哦……好吧，我只是根据经验说的。嘿，我能问你一件事吗？”

"Sure."

"What's happening here? I mean with us? Don't take this thewrong way, but not too long ago I would have laughed ifsomeone had told me we would have ever been sitting here likethis. I do enjoy it, don't misunderstand... its just that... forexample; I keep looking down and seeing this devastatinglygorgeous redhead I want to kiss right now, but I'm afraid its notwelcome because she's always yelled at me for so much astouching her in the past. I know how dumb this sounds, but it'show I feel."  
“这里发生了什么事？我指的是我们？别误会，但不久前，如果有人告诉我我们会像这样坐在这里，我会笑的。我确实喜欢这样，别误会。 .. 就是这样... 例如；我一直低着头，看到我现在想亲吻的那个极其美丽的红发女郎，但我担心它不受欢迎，因为我知道她过去总是因为触碰她而对我大喊大叫。这听起来多么愚蠢，但这表明了我的感受。”

She looked into his eyes and sighed. 'This is what I get forpicking on him so much, isn't it?' she thought sourly.  
她看着他的眼睛，叹了口气。 “这就是我对他如此挑剔的结果，不是吗？”她酸溜溜地想。

"Ikari, you shouldn't be so timid, you can kiss me if you wantto," She told him as she leaned in and taught by example.  
“碇，你不应该这么胆怯，如果你想的话，你可以吻我，”她一边倾身教导他，一边以身作则。

Somewhere during the kiss they both lost any sense of time.  
在接吻的过程中，他们都失去了时间感。

---

Time passed and the two grew even closer.  
时间一点一滴过去，两人的距离也越来越近。

One morning at sunrise, Shinji climbed out of bed and walkedto the balcony. He did this most mornings; it was becoming aroutine. Asuka had come to expect it, and most of the time; ignoreit. She was still sound asleep when he stepped out of their roomand up to the rail to look out at the bay that had once been Tokyo3.  
一天早晨，日出时分，真嗣从床上爬起来，走到阳台上。大多数早晨他都会这样做。这已成为家常便饭。明日香已经预料到了这一点，而且大多数时候都是如此。忽略它。当他走出房间，站在栏杆上眺望曾经是东京的海湾时，她还在熟睡中。

Awhile later as he looked out at the mist covered landscapebeyond he heard movement from within the apartment. Smilinghe turned to find Asuka walking up and wrapping the blanket thatmostly covered her around him as well as she lay her head againsthis arm.  
过了一会儿，当他望着外面薄雾笼罩的风景时，他听到公寓内有动静。他微笑着转过身来，发现明日香走了过来，把几乎盖住她的毯子裹在他身上，头靠在他的手臂上。

As they watched the sunrise in the distance Asuka placed ahand over her stomach. She knew she ought to tell him before thechanges became too visible. It was funny, for so long she hadbeen disgusted by the idea of ever having children, now the ideawas filling her with a sense of excitement. She would tell him in afew days, for now she needed to think. Her mother hadn't alwaysbeen the way she was after her accident, and Asuka was slowlyremembering the kind woman who she had once been.  
当他们看着远处的日出时，明日香将一只手放在肚子上。她知道她应该在变化变得太明显之前告诉他。有趣的是，长期以来她一直对生孩子的想法感到厌恶，现在这个想法让她充满了兴奋感。几天后她就会告诉他，现在她需要考虑一下。她的母亲在事故发生后并不总是这样，明日香慢慢地记起了她曾经的那个善良的女人。

Shinji on the other hand had finally come to terms with hisfather in an unusual but interesting fashion. Not to far from wherehis mother's grave lay, there was a fresh marker bearing the nameGendou Rokubungi. Unconventional, perhaps. But Shinji hadtaken a great amount of satisfaction in the act of stripping hismother's name from the man. It was a strangely fittingpunishment for the long list of betrayals.  
另一方面，真嗣最终以一种不寻常但有趣的方式与他的父亲达成了妥协。离他母亲的坟墓不远的地方，有一个新的标记，上面写着“元道六分义”。也许是非常规的。但真嗣对从这个男人身上剥夺他母亲的名字感到非常满意。对于一长串的背叛行为来说，这是一个奇怪而恰当的惩罚。

They still had their arguments, but slowly that was happeningless often. Their fights never lasted long, and they were learningmore about one another each day. Twice a month they made theirway down to Kaji's shrine where they tended the rapidly growinggardens that they had planted there. They were forging a lifetogether, and it was good.  
他们仍然有争论，但慢慢地这种情况就不再发生了。他们的争吵从来没有持续太久，而且他们每天都在了解彼此。他们每个月两次前往加持的神社，在那里照料他们在那里种植的快速生长的花园。他们一起创造生活，这很好。

For theirs' was not the story of the end, but that of the newbeginning.  
因为他们的故事不是结束的故事，而是新的开始。

welcome to the second draft of Wake!  
欢迎来到《唤醒》第二稿！

I dont have much to add this time around so I'm keeping most ofthe origonal notes. Wake was my second fanfiction, and I'm stillproud of it. I've probably gotten more Email on this fic than anyother. (in a way that's depressing since Moonlight Sonata hasalways been the favrorite amungst my fics ^_^) I'm glad so manypeople have enjoyed it, and I hope they enjoy the second drafteven more.  
这次我没有太多要补充的，所以我保留了大部分原来的笔记。 《唤醒》是我的第二部同人小说，我仍然为此感到自豪。我收到的有关这部小说的电子邮件可能比其他任何小说都多。 （在某种程度上，这是令人沮丧的，因为《月光奏鸣曲》一直是我的小说中最喜欢的^_^）我很高兴有这么多人喜欢它，我希望他们更喜欢第二稿。

The first time around there were serious gramar problems,formating glitches, continuality errors and a few other screw ups.With a bit of luck I've found and eliminated most of these, and thisought to be the difinitave draft of this fanfiction. Hope y'all comeback for more ^_^  
第一次出现了严重的语法问题、格式错误、连续性错误和其他一些错误。幸运的是，我发现并消除了其中的大部分问题，这应该是这部同人小说的最终草稿。希望大家多多回来^_^

origonal notes:

They will never be the perfect couple in the traditional sense,but in their own way I see Asuka and Shinji as a very good match.I think that those two need each other more than either wouldadmit (particularly Asuka). I know some of you out there doprefer the Rei / Shinji pair up, and it does have its strong points,but it has its flaws as well. (Mostly concerning _what_ Rei is) Ido enjoy Rei / Shinji stories, and am just as much a fan of Rei as Iam of Asuka, but the whole DNA of his mom thing creeps me outtoo much for me to fully support the match. Please understandthat I mean no disrespect... and please don't launch those mail-bombs. ^_^  
他们永远不会成为传统意义上的完美情侣，但以他们自己的方式，我认为明日香和真嗣是非常好的搭配。我认为这两个人比任何一方都承认（尤其是明日香）更加需要彼此。我知道你们中的一些人更喜欢丽/真嗣这对组合，它确实有其优点，但也有其缺陷。 （主要是关于 Rei 是什么）我很喜欢 Rei / Shinji 的故事，并且我和 Asuka 一样都是 Rei 的粉丝，但是他妈妈的整个 DNA 让我感到害怕，以至于我无法完全支持这场比赛。请理解，我没有不尊重的意思……请不要发射那些邮件炸弹。 ^_^

Those fans of Shinji sans-spine might not care for this, but Idon't see him lasting more than an hour without one given thecompany he will be keeping. Plus if everything he went throughdidn't help him grow one then I don't know what would. As acertain cowled individual once said, "He is just one strongmoment from making sense of it all" (granted; Bats was talkingabout a gal but it was close enough for the paraphrasing)  
那些无脊柱真嗣的粉丝可能不关心这一点，但考虑到他将继续陪伴，我认为他不会在没有人的情况下坚持超过一个小时。另外，如果他经历的一切都不能帮助他成长，那么我不知道还有什么可以帮助他成长。正如某个戴头巾的人曾经说过的那样，“他只是理解这一切的一个重要时刻”（当然；蝙蝠正在谈论一个女孩，但它对于释义来说已经足够接近了）

After I wrote most of this I ran across a fic called "the one Ilove is" and I think the author of that story put the reasons for theAsuka / Shinji match best. And those reasons include the fact thatthey compliment one another. She can drive him to come out ofhis shell and be more of a man, and he can open her heart andshow her that needing others and loving others is not a weakness.It's a yin /yang thing I suppose. And as I tried to say in here, afterwhat they went through I am sure both of them were changeddramatically. The last words Asuka said in End of Evangelion are"Kimouchi warui" and there are about 4 different opinions on justwhat the phrase means. I chose to interpret her has being annoyedwith Shinji and saying basically that they way he acts makes hersick. Other than that I made some of the interpretations Shinji hadof Instrumentality vague and confused, because... hell theyprobably would be. Most of the audience knew more than Shinjidid and a lot of THEM are still confused about exactly whathappened. (And no I don't pretend full to have comprehension ifit all)  
在我写完大部分内容后，我偶然发现了一篇名为“我所爱的人”的小说，我认为该故事的作者对明日香/真嗣比赛的原因做了最好的阐述。这些原因包括他们互相称赞这一事实。她可以驱使他走出自己的外壳，变得更像一个男人，他可以打开她的心，让她知道需要别人和爱别人并不是弱点。我想这是一个阴/阳的事情。正如我在这里想说的那样，在他们经历了这些之后，我确信他们俩都发生了巨大的变化。明日香在《新世纪福音战士 终章》中所说的最后一句话是“Kimouchi warui”，对于这句话的含义大约有 4 种不同的意见。我选择解释她对真嗣很恼火，基本上说他的行为方式让她感到恶心。除此之外，我对真嗣对工具性的一些解释做出了模糊和困惑，因为……他们可能会是这样。大多数观众比辛吉迪知道得更多，而且很多人仍然对到底发生了什么感到困惑。 （不，我不会假装完全理解）

The whole Asuka and Shinji after impact thing has been doneseveral times. I did notice when reading some of them that theytended to portray the area as a jungle, or a wasteland despite thefact that several buildings could be seen in the distance. Btw, theidea that Misato's apartment survived is a thin chance, but apossible one when you look at the sketches in the Newtype 100%book. It all depends on which directing those hills are facing ^_^  
整个明日香和真嗣撞击后的事情已经做过好几次了。我在阅读其中一些文章时确实注意到，他们倾向于将该地区描绘成丛林或荒地，尽管远处可以看到几座建筑物。顺便说一句，美里的公寓幸存下来的可能性很小，但当你看看 Newtype 100% 书中的草图时，这是可能的。这完全取决于这些山丘所面向的方向^_^

Hopefully I've been able to add something new to a categorythat is filling fast. I just want to assure the readers out there that Idid not intently copy anyone else's work. Any similarities are acoincidence.  
希望我能够为快速填满的类别添加一些新内容。我只是想向读者保证，我没有故意抄袭其他人的作品。任何相似之处均属巧合。

Oh and for all those hentai out there (you know who you are)yes there is a lemon out-take from this story ^_^ its called WATER HAZARD  
哦，对于所有那些无尽的人（你知道你是谁），是的，这个故事有一个柠檬味的东西 ^_^ 它叫做水危害

Hope this was a fun read, and any CC is welcome send it [tohotwire1@airmail.net](mailto:tohotwire1@airmail.net) if you have something to point out.  
希望这是一篇有趣的文章，如果您有什么要指出的，欢迎任何抄送者将其发送至hotwire1@airmail.net。

[Sandi Griffin](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7821/Sandi-Griffin): A piece of garbage. I'm probably the only person who will admit it, but that's what this fanfic is. First of all, did Hotwire say that this was a second draft? The spelling and grammar are still at a fourth grader's level. Unless "loosing everyone" was supposed to be some sort of pun, in which case, it was a bad one. I shudder to think what the original (or is that "origonal") might have been like.  
一个垃圾。我可能是唯一会承认这一点的人，但这就是这部同人小说的内容。首先，Hotwire 是否说过这是第二稿？拼写和语法仍处于四年级学生的水平。除非“失去所有人”应该是某种双关语，在这种情况下，这是一个糟糕的双关语。一想到原作（或者说“原作”）会是什么样子，我就不寒而栗。  
  
This is an Asuka/Shinji WAFF with all of the cliches that that implies: Asuka and Shinji are forced to act completely out of character in utter contradiction to the canon, in particular the theme of isolation that was central to the show. Asuka, of course, gets the worst of this, with Hotwire attempting to portray her as some Parkeresque "tough on the outside, wishing for some man to come and sweep her off of her feet because she can't make it on her own on the inside girl;" when in fact she's someone who chews and regurgitates the biggest tragedy of her life to justify her own vicious behavior. (Ironically, most Asuka fans seem to think that this makes her some sort of sympathetic character. They should drop the "sym" prefix to be more accurate.)  
这是一部明日香/真嗣的 WAFF，其中包含了所有陈词滥调，这意味着：明日香和真嗣被迫做出完全不符合角色的行为，完全违背了设定，特别是该剧的核心主题——孤立。当然，明日香遇到了最糟糕的情况，热线试图将她描绘成某种帕克式的“外表坚强，希望有一个男人来把她迷倒，因为她无法独自做到这一点”内心的女孩；”事实上，她是一个通过咀嚼和反刍她一生中最大的悲剧来为自己的邪恶行为辩护的人。 （讽刺的是，大多数明日香粉丝似乎认为这使她成为某种富有同情心的角色。他们应该删除“sym”前缀才能更准确。）  
  
The reader can see this from the beginning. If it had begun later in the fanfic, then I wouldn't have had as much to say; but almost as early as Scene I, we see Asuka exhibiting caring and gratitude toward Shinji, something which is in direct contradiction to everything from episode 16 onward. And of course, Asuka cries about her treatment of Shinji and Shinji's treatment of herself; when in actuality, Asuka would never cry about anything other than Eva or her mother. At best, Asuka could only find crocodile tears to shed for Shinji (episode 9.) Hotwire also succeeds one of Austin Covello's biggest Asuka flaws: Having her show negative feelings toward Commander Ikari. During the series, she was completely ambivalent about Gendo, yet all of a sudden, Asuka shows either hatred of fear toward Shinji's father as a way of forcing them to have something in common that they really don't. But Hotwire breaks new ground in the parade of OOC Asuka cliches himself: He overstates Asuka's affections for Kaji. Asuka's crush on Kaji was superficial at best, schoolgirlish during the times when he and Misato hated each other, and afterward he only served as a rivalry between her and Misato. Yet Hotwire has her building shrines to him toward the end of the fanfic. Sure, Hotwire manages at times to capture just how pathetic Asuka can be, but for all of the wrong reasons.  
读者从一开始就可以看到这一点。如果它是在同人小说中较晚开始的，那么我就不会说那么多了；但几乎早在第一场，我们就看到明日香对真嗣表现出了关心和感激，这与第 16 集以后的一切都直接矛盾。当然，明日香会因为她对待真嗣的方式以及真嗣对待自己的方式而哭泣。事实上，除了伊娃或她的母亲之外，明日香永远不会为任何事情哭泣。最好的情况下，明日香只能为真嗣流下鳄鱼的眼泪（第9集）。热线也继承了奥斯汀·科维罗最大的明日香缺陷之一：让她对碇指挥官表现出负面情绪。在剧集中，她对源堂的态度完全矛盾，但突然之间，明日香对真嗣的父亲表现出恐惧的仇恨，以此迫使他们拥有一些他们实际上没有的共同点。但 Hotwire 在 OOC 明日香的陈词滥调中开辟了新天地：他夸大了明日香对加持的感情。明日香对加持的迷恋充其量只是肤浅的，在他和美里互相憎恨的时候，就像女学生一样，后来他只是充当了她和美里之间的竞争者。然而，在同人小说的结尾处，热线为他建造了神殿。当然，Hotwire 有时会设法捕捉明日香的可悲之处，但原因全都是错误的。  
  
Shinji is also OOC. Again, too early in the fanfic, he shows backbone like you wouldn't believe. He stands up to Asuka. He's there for Asuka in her times of need. He's there as a shoulder to cry on for her. Come on! Shinji wouldn't even do that for Misato when Kaji died. What evidence is there to suggest that Asuka, who intimidated him to the point where he could barely function, perhaps more so than even Gendo did, would elicit these feelings of nurturing? The answer is none. Zilch. Nada. Shinji is a character who withdraws into himself at any stimuli. And don't argue "Manga Shinji," either. This was Hideaki Anno's work, and Hikeaki Anno's name is not on the Manga. The Manga is apocryphal, end of story.  
真嗣也OOC了。再说一次，在同人小说的早期，他表现出了你难以置信的勇气。他勇敢地面对明日香。在明日香需要帮助的时候，他会出现在她身边。他是她哭泣的肩膀。快点！加持死后，真嗣甚至不会为美里这么做。有什么证据表明，明日香将他恐吓到几乎无法正常工作，甚至可能比源堂更严重，会引发这些养育感？答案是否定的。齐尔奇。没什么。真嗣是一个在任何刺激下都会退缩的角色。也不要争论“漫画真嗣”。这是庵野英明的作品，漫画上并没有庵野英明的名字。漫画是杜撰的，故事结束了。  
  
Stylistically, the only thing that can be said for "Wake" is that it somehow managed to choose between prose and script, which is more than I can say for most Eva writers. But that's all I can say about it. This was the most grueling 17,000-plus word fanfic I've ever read. And no, I don't have a problem with the length: I've read fanfics that were twice as long, but the words flew right past. This fanfic's pace was so slow that it DRAGGED. I honestly couldn't wait for it to be over. The use of stream-of-consciousness in this fanfic was not done well at all. During one sentence, the narritive would be in the first person; in the next, third person. It was done clumsily, and that cluminess ruined its impact on the story and even detracted from it. But the worst, THE WORST thing I saw was the use of elipses as a pause in dialogue. If there's a pause in a conversation where a character doesn't say anything, "..." just doesn't cut it. No self-respecting writer would ever do it, especially when "..." could easily be replaced by a short line of narritive indicating silence at least. "..." is just LAZY WRITING, and that is the plague of Eva fiction. There's no excuse for it.  
从风格上来说，《唤醒》唯一可以说的是它在散文和剧本之间做出了某种选择，这对于大多数伊娃作家来说是我无法说的。但这就是我能说的。这是我读过的最累人的 17,000 多字同人小说。不，我对长度没有问题：我读过两倍长的同人小说，但文字很快就过去了。这篇同人小说的节奏太慢了，拖沓了。老实说，我等不及它结束了。这篇同人小说中意识流的运用一点都不好。在一个句子中，叙述将以第一人称；在下一个，第三人称。它做得很笨拙，这种笨拙破坏了它对故事的影响，甚至减损了它。但最糟糕的是，我看到的最糟糕的事情是使用省略号作为对话的暂停。如果对话中有一个停顿，角色什么也没说，“……”就不会结束。没有一个有自尊心的作家会这么做，尤其是当“……”很容易被一小段叙述性的至少表明沉默的叙述所取代时。 “……”只是懒惰的写作，这就是伊娃小说的瘟疫。没有任何借口。  
  
In short, this was merely a catelog of Asuka/Shinji WAFF cliches, punctuated by the ultimate cliche, Asuka pregnant. What better way to end this one than by Asuka having Shinji's baby a la Terizaki? If you're smart, you'll pass this up in favor of those Akito/Ryoko shippers in the Nadesico section. At least those are in character and mostly on canon.  
简而言之，这只是明日香/真嗣 WAFF 陈词滥调的一个类别，中间夹杂着终极陈词滥调：明日香怀孕了。还有什么比让明日香为真嗣生下照崎的孩子更好的方式来结束这一切呢？如果你聪明的话，你会放弃这个，转而选择 Nadesico 区的 Akito/Ryoko 托运人。至少这些都是在角色中，而且大部分是在佳能上。


[SirPhilip](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/107106/SirPhilip): Great Story. I think that is what happened after the Third Impact if noone else left from joining with Lilith after Shinji and Asuka or whatever happened. I think you did an excellent job with Asuka's and Shinji's character evolution. I agree with all of your notes on couples, Shinji growing a spine, and what the hell happened after the 3rd Impact.  
很棒的故事。我认为这就是第三次冲击之后发生的事情，如果在真嗣和明日香之后没有其他人离开莉莉丝或者其他什么事情的话。我认为你在明日香和真嗣的角色进化方面做得非常出色。我同意你所有关于情侣、真嗣长出脊椎以及第三次冲击后到底发生了什么的笔记。

[Nijyen](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/94355/Nijyen): Kudos to Hotwire on a superb fic - I know I'll be looking for more of your stuff in the future. I've read a number of post-Impact fics, and this ranks among the best of them - perhaps is even THE best. The story is excellently plotted and the pacing perfect...and just as importantly, the characterization is dead-on (given what they've been through a little growth on Shinji & Asuka's parts is to be expected...And it's about time someone broached the matter of Shinji's little "indiscretion" at the beginning of EoE). Romance, drama, humor, WAFF, angst...this one has a bit of everything. While part of me would love to see a sequel, the story stands on it's own admirably and by no means NEEDS one.  
感谢 Hotwire 的精彩小说——我知道我将来会寻找更多你的作品。我读过一些后影响小说，这本书是其中最好的——甚至可能是最好的。这个故事情节非常出色，节奏也很完美……同样重要的是，人物塑造也很到位（考虑到他们在真嗣和明日香的角色上经历了一点成长，这是可以预料的……现在是时候了有人在EoE一开始就提出了真嗣的小“轻率”问题）。浪漫、戏剧、幽默、WAFF、焦虑......这一切都有。虽然我内心很想看到续集，但这个故事本身就令人钦佩，而且根本不需要续集。

**MosaicT**: I love it. I would think that I'm competent enough to say that anyone that reads this fic would love it just as much as I if not more. The plot was beautiful. WAFF engulfed me like andrenalin in my veins. If there were people who has reviewed this fic were to mention grammar and/or spelling mistakes, they have not the brains to see where the plot stands. The Greatness of this story beats the literate mistakes 1000:1. I want to say greater things about this fic. But it would only lengthen this supposedly short review. I need to add that, if Anno wanted to make a sequel to The End of Evangelion. This script should be it. And to all the people that has the slightest wont to write a romance story between Shinji and Asuka, write like this.  
我喜欢它。我认为我有足够的能力说任何读过这部小说的人都会像我一样喜欢它，甚至更多。情节很美丽。 WAFF 就像安肾上腺素一样吞噬了我的血管。如果有人在评论这部小说时提到语法和/或拼写错误，他们就没有头脑去了解情节的所在。这个故事的伟大之处以 1000:1 战胜了文学错误。关于这部小说，我想说更多的事情。但这只会延长这个所谓的简短评论。我需要补充一点，如果庵野想要制作《新世纪福音战士：终结》的续集。这个脚本应该是这样的。对于所有有一点点习惯写真嗣和明日香之间的浪漫故事的人，请像这样写。

[James Lee](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/52446/James-Lee) : One of the classics of Evafiction, this is a definite must-read for any EoE fan. Hotwire has created a very sensitive, detailed, and believable post-EoE tale where Shinji and Asuka appear to be the only survivors of the apocalypse. I especially admire, among many other scenes, (* spoiler alert ) how he depicted the events just before and during Shinji's confession of a certain indiscretion he committed in EoE. There are still some spelling errors in this revised version of the story, but what the heck, this is still a wonderful fic that remains true to the characters.  
作为 Evafiction 的经典作品之一，这绝对是 EoE 粉丝的必读之作。 Hotwire 创作了一个非常敏感、详细且可信的 EoE 后故事，其中真嗣和明日香似乎是天启的唯一幸存者。在许多其他场景中，我特别欣赏（*剧透警告*）他如何描述真嗣承认他在 EoE 中犯下的某种轻率行为之前和期间发生的事件。这个故事的修订版中仍然存在一些拼写错误，但不管怎样，这仍然是一部忠实于人物的精彩小说。

**Corvus**: I'm not the world's biggest Asuka fan; in fact, I despise her. However, much to my dismay, I like your Asuka very much :) You characterization and development of Asuka and Shinji post-TI Is very enjoyable and, more to the point, believable - with all the crap out of the way, these two strong young people could finally get around to being who they are. While my interpretation of just how much "time" had "passed" is probably longer than you might have intended, the result is only logical. Very nicely done. In fact I'd like to see more.  
我不是世界上最大的明日香粉丝；其实我很鄙视她。然而，令我沮丧的是，我非常喜欢你的明日香:)你在TI后对明日香和真嗣的塑造和发展非常令人愉快，更重要的是，可信——抛开所有的废话，这两个强大的人年轻人终于可以做自己了。虽然我对“过去”了多少“时间”的解释可能比你预期的要长，但结果是合乎逻辑的。做得非常好。事实上我还想看到更多。
