[Romulo Nidoking BR](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/109777/Romulo-Nidoking-BR)

Shinji and Asuka's story is over. The world will soon forget about them. They must also forget everything about each other to be able to move on. But as the old saying goes: "You can erase someone from your mind. Getting them out of your heart is another story". An homage to the extensive LAS/Asushin lore and romance in canon and in fan works - from past, present and the future.  
真嗣和明日香的故事已经结束。世界很快就会忘记他们。他们也必须忘记彼此的一切，才能继续前行。但正如老话所说：“你可以从脑海中抹去某个人。但要从心中抹去他们，则是另一回事”。这是对 LAS/Asushin 在正史和粉丝作品中广泛传说与浪漫故事的致敬——从过去、现在到未来。

Originally, this was going to be something like a 50k words one-shot, but I've decided to publish it in the traditional chapter format. The early chapters may fell a little weird but, hopefully, everything will be explained at the right time. I hope you enjoy the ride.  
原本打算写成一篇约 5 万字的一发完结作品，但我决定采用传统的章节格式来发布。前几章可能会显得有些奇怪，但希望在适当的时候一切都能得到解释。愿你享受这段旅程。

### Prologue: Mustn't Run Away Train

The ponytailed boy wakes up with a gasp.  
扎着马尾的男孩猛地惊醒，喘着气。

As he removes the plugs of his SDAT device, he realizes that he is sitting at the far end of an empty car, looking at the window as the train slowly passes through desolate terrain.  
他拔掉 SDAT 设备的插头，意识到自己正坐在一节空荡荡车厢的尽头，望着窗外，火车缓缓驶过荒凉的地带。

After a moment, the door between cars opens.  
片刻后，车厢之间的门打开了。

A redheaded girl, wearing a yellow sundress and some odd-looking hair clips on her braided hair, enters the wagon.  
一个红发女孩，身着黄色太阳裙，头上的辫子夹着几个奇形怪状的发夹，走进了车厢。

The boy looks up. The girl is not looking at him. She busies herself deciding where to sit for a while and then finally settles on a seat at the opposite end of the car.  
男孩抬起头来。女孩并没有看他。她忙着决定坐在哪里，过了一会儿，终于在车厢的另一端选了一个座位坐下。

He feels that the girl is watching him from the corner of her eyes, as he blushes and sighs, whispering to himself - "I'm pathetic… I already fell in love with a pretty woman only because she just showed me the least bit of attention?"  
他感觉到女孩用眼角余光在观察他，他脸红叹气，自言自语地低声说——“我真没用……仅仅因为她给了我一点关注，我就已经爱上了一个漂亮的女人？”

The train now seems to be entering some kind of a tunnel, to the disappointment of the boy who was already planning to stare at the window to avoid staring at the girl like a completely hopeless idiot.  
火车现在似乎正驶入某种隧道，这让原本打算盯着窗外以避免像个彻底的傻瓜一样盯着女孩看的男孩感到失望。

"Hallo!" “哈喽！”

The boy looks over, in surprise. - "I'm sorry?"  
男孩惊讶地转过头来，问道：“对不起，你说什么？”

"What? I couldn't hear you!"  
"什么？我听不见你说话！"

"I said, I'm sorry." "我说，对不起。"

"Why are you sorry? I just said hi."  
"你为什么道歉？我只是打了个招呼。"

"No, it's just… I didn't know if you were talking to me, so..."  
"不，只是……我不知道你是不是在跟我说话，所以……"

She looks around the empty car. "Are you stupid?"  
她环顾空荡荡的车厢。“你傻吗？”

"Well, I didn't want to assume…"  
"嗯，我不想自作多情……"

"Aw, c'mon. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car."  
"哎呀，来吧。大胆假设一下，在一辆空无一人的车厢里，有人正在跟你说话。"

"Sorry. Hi." "抱歉。嗨。"

"Hi." The girl smiles and makes her way down the aisle towards the boy.  
"嗨。" 女孩微笑着，沿着过道向男孩走去。

"It's okay if I sit closer? That way I won't have to shout at you. I'm kinda tired of shouting at people people sometimes, believe you me…. But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to listen to music or something."  
"如果我坐得近一点可以吗？这样我就不用对你大喊了。有时候我真的厌倦了对人大喊大叫，相信我……不过如果你在听音乐什么的，我就不打扰你了。"

He looks at his SDAT. "No, I'm just... I don't really, um ..."  
他看了看他的 SDAT。"不，我只是...我不太，呃..."

"What? You don't really what?"  
"什么？你不太什么？"

She hesitates and stops in the middle of the car, looking back where she came from.  
她犹豫了一下，停在车厢中央，回头望向她来的方向。

"I mean… it's okay if you want to sit down here. "  
“我是说……如果你想坐在这里，没关系的。”

"Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe" -she says as she moves to sit across the aisle from the boy - "So, how far are you going?"  
“就是，你知道，随便聊聊，可能”——她边说边挪到对面过道坐下——“那么，你要去多远的地方？”

"What? Well… I really don't know."  
"什么？嗯……我真的不知道。"

"On the train, I mean, of course. Not in life".  
"在火车上，我是说，当然。不是在生活里。"

"Y-yeah, I got it." "嗯-嗯，我明白了。"

"Guess what? Never mind. My name's Asuka Langley Sohryu, by the way. Charmed." – she says, extending her hand to him.  
"猜猜看？算了。顺便说一下，我叫惣流·明日香·兰格雷。很高兴认识你。" – 她说着，向他伸出手。

"Uh… yeah… Likewise. I'm Ikari…. Shinji Ikari."  
"呃… 是的… 我也是。我叫碇… 碇真嗣。"

"Ikari? Hm… I think I've heard that name before. Wait. you're not a stalker or anything, right?"  
"碇？嗯… 我好像在哪儿听过这个名字。等等。你不是跟踪狂之类的吧？"

"Hey! I'm not a stalker. You're the one who talked to me, remember?"  
“嘿！我可不是跟踪狂。是你先跟我搭话的，记得吗？”

"That is the oldest trick in the stalker book."  
"那是跟踪者手册里最老的伎俩了。"

"Really? There's a stalker book? Great, I gotta read that one."  
"真的吗？还有跟踪者手册？太好了，我得读读那本。"

"Oh, I bet you would because... wait, are you trying to flirt with me Mr. Ikari?  
"哦，我敢打赌你会的，因为...等等，碇先生，你是在跟我调情吗？"

"No, it's not like that…. It's just I… I don't know. I was just... You seem nice, so –"  
"不，不是那样的……我只是……我不知道。我只是……你看起来不错，所以——"

"Nice? Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? Nice doesn't reveal anything. Nice is pandering. Cowardly. And life is more interesting than that. Or should be. I hope it is... someday. I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me!"  
"不错？现在我不错了？你就不会用别的词吗？不错什么也说明不了。不错是讨好。懦弱的。而生活应该比这更有趣。或者应该有。我希望有一天会是……我不需要不错。我不需要自己成为那样，也不需要别人对我那样！"

"Okay, I understand." "好吧，我明白了。"

"No, of course you don't understand you moron."  
"不，你当然不懂，你这个白痴。"

"Sorry…" "对不起…"

They stood in silence for a while, avoiding to look at each other.  
他们沉默地站了一会儿，避免看向对方。

"Shinji? It's Shinji, right?"  
"真嗣？是真嗣，对吧？"

"Yes?" "是的？"

"I... I shouldn't have yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today."  
“我……我不该对你大喊大叫的。那算是喊叫吗？我也说不准。反正，我今天有点心烦意乱。”

"That's ok. 'Yeller' is a color that suits you."  
“没关系。‘黄色’这种颜色很适合你。”

"Hm? Oh, I get it. That was a really lame joke, you know. Or maybe... you were once again shameless flirting with me because you like how my body fits this dress?"  
“嗯？哦，我明白了。那真是个蹩脚的笑话，你知道的。或者……你又在无耻地调情，因为你喜欢我的身体穿上这条裙子的样子？”

"No… I'm… I'm…" “不……我……我……”

"Come on, relax. If you are gonna flirt you gotta be prepared for the other person to push back, right?"  
“来吧，放松点。如果你打算调情，就得准备好对方也会回击，对吧？”

"Yes but… it's still somehow embarrassing."  
"是的，但是……还是有点尴尬。"

"Oh… so you really did make an embarrassing admission after all."  
"哦……所以你真的还是说了些尴尬的话。"

"…"

"That's ok, Shinji. I'm gonna share an embarrassing admission to you too, so we will be even. My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're so hmm… nice.  
"没关系，真嗣。我也要向你坦白一件尴尬的事，这样我们就扯平了。我的尴尬坦白是，我真的很喜欢你这么……嗯……善良。"

"I thought that you didn't like nice."  
"我以为你不喜欢‘好’呢。"

"I don't!" – she says in an annoyed way – "But in your case nice is ok, I guess. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. As of right now I'm glad you are. But sometimes I have premonitions, so I don't know. Maybe that's just a coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think about something and then it happens, or you think of a word and then someone says it?"  
"我确实不喜欢！"" ——她带着一丝恼怒说道—— ""但对你来说，‘好’还可以，我想。至少现在是这样。我无法预料下一刻我会喜欢什么。就目前而言，我很高兴你是这样的。但有时候我有预感，所以我也不确定。也许那只是巧合。对吧？你知道，你想着某件事，然后它就发生了，或者你想到了一个词，接着就有人说了出来？"

"Erh… I don't know… I guess I've never thought about it that way…"  
“呃……我不知道……我猜我从没这么想过……”

"You're kind of closed-mouthed, aren't you?"  
“你有点守口如瓶，不是吗？”

"Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I don't know what to say. You should read my journal. It's just, like, blank."  
抱歉。我的生活没那么有趣。我不知道该说什么。你应该看看我的日记，里面空空如也。

"Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have."  
那会让你感到悲伤吗？还是焦虑？我总是担心自己没有充分活出生命的精彩，你知道吗？充分利用每一个可能的机会？只是想确保我没有浪费一分一秒，毕竟我拥有的时间如此有限。

"I… I try to not think too much about that. But… I guess you're right to think about it."  
“我……我尽量不去多想这些。但……我想你考虑这个问题是对的。”

"You're really nice. I really shouldn't have yelled at you before about it. Gott, I'm dreadful."  
"你真的很不错。之前真不该冲你大喊大叫的。天啊，我真是糟糕透了。"

"It's okay. I'm just not that good with words I think."  
"没关系。我只是不太擅长用言语表达自己。"

"You really are stupid, aren't you? If you are not good with words, you gotta make up for it with your actions. Anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you, my goal?"  
"你确实挺傻的，不是吗？如果言语不行，就得用行动来弥补。不管怎样，你太低估自己了。我能看出来。你脑子里有很多想法。我能看出来。我的目标...我能告诉你我的目标吗？"

"Yeah, I guess". “嗯，我想是的。”

"I used to think that if I behaved like an adult and did exactly what people expected from me, I would be happy. But I won't be like that anymore. My goal, Shinji, is to just let it flow through me. Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. You love someone - that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life - that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. Of being an adult. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?"  
我曾以为，只要表现得像个成年人，完全按照人们的期望行事，我就会快乐。但以后我不会再那样了。我的目标，真嗣，是让一切自然流过我心。你明白我的意思吗？就像，有这么多情感和想法，它们来得快，变化无常，离去又以不同形式归来，而我们都被教导应该保持一致。你爱一个人——那就是永远。你选择用一生去做某件事——那就是你做的，坚持到底，见证成果，是成熟的标志，是成人的象征。而我感觉，那样做就是在扼杀自己，因为你停止倾听什么是真实的，而真实的东西总是在不断变化。你懂吗？

"Yeah. I think so. It's hard to."  
"是啊。我想是的。这很难说。"

"Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?"  
"就像我想和你说话。我不需要更多的理由去做这件事。谁知道还有什么更大的宇宙理由存在呢？"

"Yeah". "嗯。"

"Ha.. you are now thinking that I'm gonna marry you, right?"  
“哈..你现在一定在想我要娶你，对吧？”

The boy blushes heavily. 男孩脸红得厉害。

"I knew it!" “我就知道！”

"Sorry…" "对不起…"

The girl looks at him with a menacious glare.  
女孩用威胁的目光盯着他。

"O-okay. You've got me." "好-好吧。你赢了。"

"You're so nice that it's borderline stupid. Gott, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?"  
"你太好了，简直有点傻。天啊，我得改掉这话。你在我面前很紧张，对吧？"

"No. Yeah. Sort of. Not really".  
"不。是。有点。也不全是。"

"Well, I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively ugly for having this scar in my eye?"  
“嗯，我有点紧张。不过你在我面前不用紧张的。我喜欢你。你觉得我因为这只眼睛上的伤疤而显得特别丑陋吗？”

"No! N-not at all." "不！完全不。"

"I don't either. I used to. I've got other scars too. But I'm through with that. They are here and they are part of me. We must accept these scars we bear, right? If I don't love my body, then I'm just lost."  
"我也不。我以前会的。我还有其他伤疤。但我已经走出来了。它们在这里，是我的一部分。我们必须接受这些我们背负的伤疤，对吧？如果我不爱惜自己的身体，那我就迷失了。"

He notices the thin scar tissue in her eye, certainly the result of some nasty act of violence. However, he wasn't scared or disgusted at all. Seeing those scars only made him more interested to know more about this girl.  
他注意到了她眼角那道细薄的疤痕，无疑是某种暴力行为的后果。然而，他丝毫没有感到恐惧或厌恶。看到那些伤痕，反而让他更加渴望了解这个女孩。

"You know what, Shinji? Let's make a bet."  
“你知道吗，真嗣？我们打个赌吧。”

"What…a bet? Why?" "什么……打赌？为什么？"

"Because I'm bored. This train looks like it's not even moving."  
"因为我无聊。这火车看起来像是一动不动。"

"Is that your reason? You are weird."  
"这就是你的理由？你真奇怪。"

"Are you really such a coward that you're going to run away from a bet without even knowing what it is? Or is it because there's something wrong with me?"  
"你真的这么胆小，连赌注是什么都不知道就打算逃跑吗？还是说，是因为我有什么问题？"

"No, it's not that. Please… I'm sorry… the thing is… oh God, I'm just too nervous around you right now."  
"不，不是那样的。请……对不起……问题是……哦天哪，我现在只是在你身边太紧张了。"

The girl looks away from him. Only after a short and uncomfortable pause, she responds.  
女孩移开了视线。短暂的尴尬停顿后，她才回应道。

"I'm nervous, too." “我也紧张。”

"What? I wouldn't have thought that."  
“什么？我可没想到。”

"Well, you obviously don't know me. At least I'm not a coward to admit it."  
“好吧，你显然不了解我。至少我不是个不敢承认的懦夫。”

"I'm not afraid."

"Oh yeah? So, tell me why my presence nerves you so much?"  
“哦，是吗？那告诉我，为什么我的出现会让你如此紧张？”

"O-okay…I'm nervous because…. I got an enormous crush on you!"  
“好、好的……我紧张是因为……我对你有超级大的好感！”

The boy blushes again, only to see that, this time, the girl got a similar reaction herself.  
男孩再次脸红，却发现这次女孩也露出了相似的反应。

"Okay… good. You're not as wimpy as I thought. So… are you gonna take the bet or not?"  
“好吧……不错。你没我想的那么胆小。那么……你到底敢不敢接这个赌？”

"Y-yes… I guess… if you still want to do it…"  
"好…好的…我想…如果你还想这么做的话…"

"Great! So, it's a deal. Come on. The bet is this: I bet you can't kiss me on the mouth..."  
"太好了！那么，就这么定了。来吧。赌注是这样的：我赌你不敢亲我的嘴…"

His blush become even greater and he felt his heart skip a beat.  
他的脸颊愈发红润，心跳也漏了一拍。

"Take it easy, you pervert! I'm not finished yet. I bet you can't kiss me on the mouth... without touching my lips."  
“别急，你这色狼！我还没说完呢。我打赌你不敢亲我的嘴……而不碰到我的嘴唇。”

"Oh...but that is..." “哦...但那是...”

"Impossible, eh? So… I think I already won the bet, already." - she says with a smirk.  
"不可能，是吧？所以……我想我已经赢了赌注，已经。" - 她带着一丝得意的笑容说道。

The boy sighed, in defeat.  
男孩叹了口气，败下阵来。

"Aren't you even going to try? That's pathetic."  
"你甚至都不打算试试吗？真是可悲。"

"No...I mean... ok, but… I need you to close your eyes!"  
"不...我是说...好吧，但是…我需要你闭上眼睛！"

The girl looks surprised by his odd and firm request, but she takes a leap of faith and closes her eyes.
女孩对他的奇怪而坚定的请求感到惊讶，但还是选择相信，闭上了眼睛。

The boy analyzes his situation. In just a few seconds he was able to think about how thirty ways he could give thirty kisses on that gorgeous girl. But it's pointless. There is simply no way to kiss her in the mouth without touching her lips.  
男孩分析着自己的处境。短短几秒内，他便构思出三十种方式，能在那位美丽女孩身上留下三十个吻。然而这一切都徒劳无功。想要亲吻她的唇，不触碰那柔软的唇瓣根本无从谈起。

His heart beat accelerates as he starts to swelter. However, one single thought crossed his mind. _"I mustn't run away."_  
他的心跳加速，身体开始发热。然而，一个念头掠过脑海：“我绝不能逃跑。”

Almost one minute has passed by and the signs of anxiety and anger were already becoming visible in the girl's face, as well as a discrete moisture forming in her eyes.  
几乎一分钟过去了，女孩脸上已显露出焦虑与愤怒的迹象，眼眶中也隐约泛起了泪光。

She starts to open her mouth... only to feel his lips touching hers.  
她正要开口……却感到他的唇触碰上了她的。

Those lips were warm and wet. The contact was brief, but it felt like a lifetime has passed in that moment. She opens her eyes, visibly surprised, and this makes the boy suddenly pull away from her.  
那双唇温暖而湿润。接触虽短暂，却仿佛在那瞬间度过了一生。她睁开眼睛，明显感到惊讶，这让男孩突然从她身边抽离。

"I'm sorry Asuka... I guess I've… lost it. The bet, I mean. Right?"  
"对不起，明日香...我想我已经...输了。我是说，打赌的事。对吧？"

"Y-yes, sure you lost, you pervert. What were you thinking about?"  
“是啊，当然是你输了，变态。你刚才在想什么呢？”

"I'm sorry. I…. just felt it was right to do that. This seemed like the perfect romantic occasion to do it and…"  
“对不起。我……只是觉得那样做是对的。这似乎是表白的绝佳时机，而且……”

"Hmph…. You're really stupid, you know? How old are you? Fourteen? Thinking about romantic cliches won't do you any good in real life."  
“哼……你真是蠢得可以，知道吗？多大了，十四岁？沉溺于浪漫的陈词滥调在现实生活中可帮不了你。”

The boy lowers his head. Suddenly, looking at his feet appeared to be the most pleasant thing to do right now.  
男孩低下了头。突然间，盯着双脚看似乎成了此刻最令人愉悦的事情。

"Let me tell you something, idiot." - The girl's voice managed to make him look at her again, by reflex - "I don't like perverts or love-sick boys, but I just cannot stand people that accept defeat and give up so easily, got it?"  
“听好了，傻瓜。”女孩的声音让他不由自主地再次看向她，“我不喜欢变态或痴情少年，但我更受不了那些轻易认输放弃的人，明白吗？”

"S-sor..." “对-对不起...”

Covered in shame, he attempts to move farther away from her, only to be stopped by a strong grip on his hand.  
满怀羞愧，他试图离她更远些，却被一只强有力的手紧紧抓住了手腕。

""Hey, hey… It was… a nice try. And… since I'm really generous I think I'm gonna give you another chance. W-what do you say? Are you up for the second try?"  
""嘿，嘿……那是个……不错的尝试。而且……既然我这么慷慨，我想我会再给你一次机会。你意下如何？准备好迎接第二次挑战了吗？""

The boy can't believe in the sudden change of mood. What is wrong with this girl? There is only one rational answer to this question. And it was not the one that slipped out of his mouth.  
男孩难以置信这突如其来的情绪变化。这女孩是怎么了？对此问题，只有一个合理的答案。然而，脱口而出的却并非那个答案。

"Y-yes." “是、是的。”

They both blush as they realize that they are, in fact , holding hands. Also, their faces were closer to each other's than they were at the start of the first attempt.  
他们俩都脸红了，意识到实际上他们正牵着手。而且，他们的脸比第一次尝试开始时更靠近彼此了。

At that moment, the train's lights went out, making an annoying rumbling loud noise, that sounds like an inhuman scream.  
就在那一刻，火车的灯光熄灭了，发出一阵恼人的隆隆巨响，那声音宛如非人的尖叫。

A scream that reminds them of old nightmares, but also a shout that buzzes in their hearts, full of solace and warmth.  
一声尖叫，唤起了他们旧日的梦魇，却又是一声呼喊，在心间嗡鸣，满载慰藉与温暖。

They hug each other as they watch two glowing, ghostly, angelic-looking figures, emerge from the darkness.  
他们相拥而视，只见两个散发着光芒、幽灵般、天使般模样的身影从黑暗中浮现。

---

As soon as I opened my eyes, I could finally stop listening to those voices and stare at what was in front of me.  
我一睁开眼，终于可以不再听那些声音，而是凝视眼前的一切。

An unfamiliar ceiling. 一个陌生的天花板。

My hands were covered with bandages, but other than that, I couldn't notice anything wrong .  
我的双手缠满了绷带，除此之外，我并未察觉到任何异常。

Besides the fact that this bed is too small and those... strands of hair touching my shoulders?  
除了这张床太小，还有那些...搭在我肩上的发丝？

"Ikari... you're finally awake... how do you feel?" - I could hear a woman's voice calling me. What was her name again?  
"碇...你终于醒了...感觉如何？" — 我听到一个女人的声音在呼唤我。她叫什么名字来着？

"Ah... I'm sorry, miss..."  
"啊...抱歉，小姐..."

"Ibuki. And that guy over there is Hyuga. Do you remember us?"  
"伊吹。那边那位是日向。你还记得我们吗？"

"I... I remember. You guys work with Misato don't you? Where is she?"  
"我...我记得。你们和美里一起工作对吧？她在哪儿？"

I watched as they looked into each other with a weird expression on their faces. The woman made a brief signal of concordance with her head and the man started to talk to me.  
我看着他们彼此交换了一个奇怪的表情。那女人短暂地点头示意同意，男人便开始对我说话。

"Ikari... what is the last thing you remember?"  
"碇...你记得的最后一件事是什么？"

A question that, at first glance, seemed to be quite simple started to make me feel a pain in my head. Everything still seemed very confusing and I took a few moments to try to remember yesterday's events. Or, at least, what happened before I ended up in this hospital room.  
一个乍看之下颇为简单的问题，却开始让我感到一阵头痛。一切似乎依旧混乱不堪，我花了片刻时间试图回忆昨天的事件。或者，至少，在我躺进这间病房之前发生了什么。

"I... I remember that we were going to… a battle? I was inside the Eva… I… don't remember anything else. W-what happened?"  
“我...我记得我们是要去...一场战斗？我在 Eva 里面...我...不记得其他了。发...发生了什么？”

"I see. Well... I think you'd better see for yourself." - the man said as his partner pulled a mirror from her purse and handed me the object in hand.  
“我明白了。嗯...我想你最好自己看看。”——那男人说道，他的同伴从包里拿出一个镜子递给我。

And then I could see it.  
然后我就能看见了。

An unfamiliar face. 一张陌生的面孔。

---

I am not sure for how long or how many days had passed been since I had that conversation with them.  
我不确定那次与他们的对话已经过去多久，或是多少天了。

From what I could understand, I've failed… and the angels won somehow. The world didn't end, but Third Impact happened and life out there will never go back to normal.  
据我所理解，我失败了……而天使们不知怎的赢了。世界并未终结，但第三次冲击发生了，外面的生活再也无法回到从前。

No surprises there. What they were thinking? Betting all of their chips on me to defend humanity? It was only a matter of time before I blew it.  
这并不意外。他们在想什么？把所有筹码都押在我身上来保卫人类？我搞砸只是时间问题。

Misato, Toji, Kensuke... probably Ayanami too. They are all dead. And so is my father. Why should I be the only one alive? I'm a failure even at that.  
美里、真嗣、健介……可能还有绫波。他们都死了。还有我父亲。为什么我应该是唯一活着的人？我连这都失败了。

That old sensation of not knowing what to do anymore hit me harder than the previous time. Why did NERV take care of me all this time if I am no longer needed?  
那种不知所措的老感觉比上次来得更猛烈。既然我不再被需要，NERV 为什么还要一直照顾我？

I just wanted to have access to my old SDAT with my precious songs at that moment. I had no intention or desire to see anybody or anyone anymore. Dying would be...  
那一刻，我只想拿到我那装满珍贵歌曲的旧 SDAT。我既不想见任何人，也没有这个愿望。死去会...

"Ikari?" “碇君？”

I looked at the door and saw a young soldier in a black suit standing at it.  
我望向门口，看到一个身穿黑色西装的年轻士兵站在那里。

"Oh... hi. Sorry, I'm not good with names. You're…"  
“哦...嗨。抱歉，我不太擅长记名字。你是…”

"Hi Shin... pilot Ikari. I'm, section 2 agent, code-name Zack Ray. I'm here to guide you back to your quarters. It's nothing like a five star's hotel, but it will be more comfortable than that hospital room."  
“嗨，真嗣...驾驶员碇。我是，第二支部特工，代号扎克·雷。我来带你回你的住处。虽然比不上五星级酒店，但总比那间病房舒服多了。”

Quarters. Right. After all this time and what happened to Misato it would be silly to think that I could return to that apartment.  
宿舍。对。经历了这么长时间和美里发生的事情，再想着回到那个公寓就太傻了。

It was only for a short time but... I managed to feel at home together with Misato and Penpen.  
虽然只是短暂的一段时间，但我……和美里、还有企企一起，找到了家的感觉。

On second thought now, it was very foolish of me. To think that I could have found something close to a home.  
现在想来，我真是太天真了。竟然以为自己能找到一个接近家的地方。

"So? Ready to go?" - the soldier said, offering him a gentle pat on his head.  
"那么？准备好了吗？" 士兵说道，轻轻拍了拍他的头。

"Erh... yes, excuse me. Let's go."  
"呃……是的，不好意思。我们走吧。"

---

What they called quarters actually looks like a mixture of a hotel room and a prison cell. A bed, a closet, a chair and a small table, and a door to the bathroom. No kitchen. Just a plastic cup and toiletries by the bathroom sink.  
他们所谓的住处实际上像是酒店房间和监狱牢房的混合体。一张床，一个衣柜，一把椅子和一张小桌子，还有一扇通往浴室的门。没有厨房。只有浴室水槽旁的一个塑料杯和洗漱用品。

Opening the cupboard, I could see a few clothes, a stack of papers and a pen... and, to my surprise, a cello, standing next to a folder containing some sheet music scores.  
打开橱柜，我可以看到几件衣服，一叠纸和一支笔……还有，令我惊讶的是，一把大提琴，旁边是一个夹着几份乐谱的文件夹。

"Officer Ray... by any chance did you guys manage to retrieve my SDAT device?"  
“雷警官……你们有没有可能找回了我的 SDAT 设备？”

"What? No, I'm sorry. I think that what is here is all that they were able to recover from your personal belongings."  
“什么？没有，很抱歉。我想这里已经是他们能从你的个人物品中找回的全部了。”

"I see..." “我明白了...”

"Well, try to rest and distract yourself a bit. In the next few days, we will probably need you." – said the soldier trying to give me some kind of a reassuring smile.  
"好吧，尽量休息一下，分散注意力。接下来的几天里，我们可能需要你。" – 士兵试图给我一个安慰的微笑说道。

I didn't answer right away. The silence lasted for a few seconds.  
我没有立即回答。沉默持续了几秒钟。

"To pilot the Eva?" "驾驶 Eva 吗？"

The soldier paused for a few moments, speaking with a sad voice before closing the door - "Try to rest a bit ok? It's pointless to think about things that you can not redo."  
士兵停顿了几秒，用悲伤的语气说道，随后关上了门——“试着休息一下好吗？纠结于无法改变的事情是徒劳的。”

The answer was clear. Why else would they have gone to all this effort to keep me alive? I realized at that moment that I was destined pilot Eva. This is a curse from which I won't be able to escape. Ever  
答案显而易见。不然他们为何费尽心思让我活下来？那一刻，我意识到自己注定要成为 Eva 的驾驶员。这是一个我永远无法摆脱的诅咒。

But what alternative was left for me in my life?  
但在我的人生中，还有什么选择留给我呢？

If the boring lectures about the Second Impact that I had endured at school were mildly accurate, then probably the world was destroyed and probably full of war, famine or even worse things.  
如果学校里那些关于第二次冲击的无聊讲座还算有点准确的话，那么世界大概已经被毁灭了，到处都是战争、饥荒，甚至更糟的事情。

Everyone I had ever met was either dead or won't care about me at all.  
我曾遇到的每一个人，要么已经死去，要么根本不会在乎我。

There was no chance for me to have a normal life anymore. I resigned to the fact that I would keep piloting Eva forever, until someone makes me to stop.  
我再也无法拥有正常的生活了。我接受了这样的事实：我将永远驾驶 EVA，直到有人让我停下来。

_I thought so. 我想也是。_

Until someone stops me? I wonder where I...  
直到有人阻止我？我想知道我在哪里...

Suddenly, I remembered the cello. Maybe the only thing left from my past.  
突然，我想起了那把大提琴。也许这是我过去唯一留下的东西。

Music always was the only thing that was able to make me disconnect from the world and have a few moments of peace. I always liked to play... to remember of better days. And to imagine that  
音乐始终是唯一能让我与世界断开联系，享受片刻宁静的东西。我总是喜欢演奏……回忆那些美好的日子。并幻想着……

Carefully, I took my cello out of the cupboard, as well as the sheet music list to try to play something.  
我小心翼翼地从橱柜里取出我的大提琴，还有乐谱清单，试图演奏些什么。

I knew it would be tricky to play it with those broken hands, so I would have to try to settle for something easy.  
我知道用这双受伤的手演奏会很困难，所以我只能尝试一些简单的曲子。

There were many sheet music scores in the folder, but apparently one of them was more worn-out than the rest, as if it had been used several times. Interestingly, I didn't remember this song or this composer, but I suppose it was a very simple one for beginners.  
文件夹里有许多乐谱，但显然其中一份比其他的都要磨损得厉害，仿佛已被使用过多次。有趣的是，我对这首歌或这位作曲家毫无印象，但我想它应该是非常适合初学者的简单曲目。

After all, it was a piece called "Suite #1".  
毕竟，这是一首名为《组曲 #1》的作品。

I carefully picked up the cello and, looking at the sheet, began to try to produce some sound.  
我小心翼翼地拿起大提琴，看着乐谱，开始尝试发出一些声音。

The cello, to my surprise, was perfectly in tune. As if it was just waiting for a musician capable of extracting beautiful notes from this instrument.  
令我惊讶的是，大提琴调音完美。仿佛它一直在等待一位能够从中奏出美妙音符的音乐家。

After several minutes, I returned the cello and the sheet music folder to the cabinet, and laid down on the bed.  
几分钟后，我将大提琴和乐谱夹放回柜子，躺在了床上。

I could not even get a single chord right.  
我甚至连一个和弦都拉不准。

_Pathetic. 可悲。_

---

On the next morning, Ray opened the door of my luxury cell. We walked, in silence, for a while, doing deeper inside this facility.  
次日清晨，雷打开了我的豪华牢房的门。我们沉默地走了一段时间，深入这个设施的内部。

It was quite different from the Geofront, but still a really claustrophobic and uncomfortable place to be. All those corridors and intersections made me feel like I was lost.  
这里与地底都市截然不同，但依旧是一个令人感到压抑和不适的地方。那些走廊和交叉口让我觉得自己迷失了方向。

Everything was very confusing, as were my memories. I should ask more questions and find out what really happened. But whenever I when I tried to remember details of the last battle simply my head started to hurt.  
一切都非常混乱，我的记忆也是如此。我应该多问些问题，弄清楚到底发生了什么。但每当我试图回忆起最后一场战斗的细节时，我的头就开始疼。

"We have arrived." “我们到了。”

As we entered this area of the facility, I was impressed. The noise was very loud and there were hundreds of people working on various tasks.  
当我们进入这个设施区域时，我感到印象深刻。噪音非常大，有数百人在进行各种任务。

The only time I remember seeing anything like this was when there was a blackout at Nerv headquarters and even my father had to come down to help prepare the Evas for the manual launch.  
我唯一记得见过类似情景的时候，是 Nerv 总部停电那天，就连我父亲也不得不下来帮忙准备 Eva 进行手动发射。

That day we fought the angel that looked like a giant Spider. Ayanami sent me the rifle and I... I...  
那天我们对抗了一个形似巨型蜘蛛的天使。绫波递给我那把步枪，而我...我...

"Is everything okay with you, Shinji?"  
“你还好吗，真嗣？”

"What? Oh yeah...sorry. I guess the noise bothered me a little."  
"什么？哦，对...抱歉。我想那噪音让我有点烦。"

We made our way downstairs, toward Ibuki and Hyuga, who were working at a computer with a huge screen. Besides them were two military officers.  
我们下楼走向伊吹和日向，他们正对着一台大屏幕电脑工作。他们旁边还有两位军官。

"Oh... welcome back. Shinji, have you gotten better?"  
"哦...欢迎回来。真嗣，你感觉好些了吗？"

"Yes." No. Of course not.  
"是的。" 不。当然不是。

"This is Dr. Ienekko and Lieutenant Kazumi Minagawa. They will help you with your test."  
"这位是伊涅克博士和上尉水川和美。他们将协助你进行测试。"

"Oh… ok. But… this... is not an Evangelion."  
"哦… 好的。但是… 这… 不是一台 EVA。"

"Correct, Ikari." – the doctor said - "You remember this robot, don't you? You had to face it on the battlefield remember?"  
"没错，碇。" – 医生说道 – "你记得这个机器人，对吧？你在战场上曾与它对峙，记得吗？"

Some flashes of memory started to cross my mind.  
一些记忆片段开始在我脑海中闪现。

A giant remotely controlled robot created by Japan Heavy and Chemical Industries Consortium. It went rampage for some reason, but I managed to intercept it with Unit 1 and was able to put Misato inside that robot to deactivate it manually.  
由日本重化工业联合体制造的巨型遥控机器人。它因某种原因暴走，但我设法用初号机拦截了它，并成功让美里进入机器人内部手动将其停用。

"It's the…. Jet Alone?" "这是……Jet Alone？"

"Good. I can see that your memory is sharp".  
"很好，看来你的记忆力很强。"

"Y-yes." - Definitely not. – "But…. If it's not an Eva, then…. why I'm here?"  
"是-是的。——绝对不是。——但是……如果不是 Eva，那……我为什么会在这里？"

The Lieutenant gave an immediate answer.  
中尉立即给出了回答。

"The Japan Heavy and Chemical Industries Consortium was integrated to the Japan Strategic Self Defense Force shortly before…. Third Impact happened. Since the test proved that the artificial intelligence wasn't good enough to be reliable in a real combat situation, the robot was adapted to a pilot system, akin to the one that you used to have in Evangelion units. That way, it will also be able to generate an A.T. Field. Miss Ibuki there was the great mind behind this project." – she said as noticed that Ibuki blushed a little, but showed a sad face.  
"日本重化学工业联合体在第三次冲击前不久被整合进了日本战略自卫队……。由于测试证明人工智能在实战情况下不够可靠，这台机器人被改装成了类似你在 EVA 单位中使用的驾驶员系统。这样一来，它也能生成 A.T.力场。那边的伊吹摩耶小姐是这个项目的幕后智囊。" ——她说着注意到伊吹微微脸红，但脸上露出了悲伤的表情。

"Don't worry Shinji." – the doctor spoke again – "You will be getting inside an entry plug and the controls will work out just like you are used to do in the Evangelion."  
"别担心，真嗣。" ——医生再次开口道—— "你会进入插入栓，控制方式会和你习惯的 EVA 操作一样。"

---

After putting on a plug suit for the first time in years, I realized that the discomfort and nausea that I've always felt before stepping inside into an entry plug.  
时隔多年再次穿上插入栓服后，我意识到那种每次进入插入栓前总会感到的不适和恶心。

I looked again at the robot in front of me before entering the plug.  
在进入插入栓之前，我又看了一眼面前的机器人。

The model was similar to the one I remembered, except that instead of a red visor at the height of its head, there was a shapeless, rhizomatic mass of organic matter in that place, spreading out to the arms and legs of the robot, like some kind of parasite.  
这个型号与我记忆中的相似，只是原本位于头部高度的红色护目镜位置，现在被一团无定形的、根茎状的有机物质所取代，这些物质蔓延至机器人的四肢，宛如某种寄生物。

As I finally managed to enter the entry plug, the first thing that I've noticed is that the feeling of claustrophobia seemed much greater than before and the smell of the LCL and beginning to fill the plug was strangely familiar.  
当我终于设法进入插入栓时，首先注意到的是幽闭恐惧感似乎比以往更加强烈，LCL 的气味开始充斥着插入栓，这种感觉却出奇地熟悉。

_What kind of perv talk is that?  
那是什么变态话题？_

There was nothing perverted about it. The smell was extremely uncomfortable.  
这根本不是什么变态的事。那种气味让人极其不适。

_"Ready for activation!" "准备激活！"_

_"Begin test! All power systems engaged!"  
"开始测试！所有动力系统启动！"_

_"Pressure values normal. Starting synchronization with the pilot".  
"压力值正常。开始与驾驶员同步。"_

I took a deep breath and prepared myself to synchronize with this...thing.  
我深吸一口气，准备与这个...东西同步。

Part of me hoped that I would fail, so that they would finally discard me and I wouldn't have to disappoint anyone anymore.  
我的一部分希望自己会失败，这样他们最终会抛弃我，我就不必再让任何人失望了。

But I knew I wouldn't be so lucky, and my suspicions were soon confirmed as I heard Ibuki's voice over the radio.  
但我知道我不会那么幸运，我的怀疑很快得到了证实，因为我听到了伊吹在无线电里的声音。

_"All harmonics nominal._ _Self-psychograph stabilizing. "_  
"所有谐波正常。自我心理图谱稳定中。"

I felt something coming straight into my head. Some… memories?  
我感觉有什么东西直冲我的脑海。一些……记忆？

A telephone booth. Rei Ayanami. A Renault Alpine A310. Misato Katsuragi. A N2 Mind. An angel. The Geofront. Ritsuko Akagi. My father. Professor Fuyutsuki. A battle. A kid getting hurt.  
一个电话亭。绫波零。一辆雷诺 Alpine A310。葛城美里。N2 心灵。一个使徒。地底都市。赤木律子。我的父亲。冬月教授。一场战斗。一个孩子受伤了。

A penguin. School. A punch to my face. Toji Suzuhara. Kensuke Aida. Another battle. Running away. A camping trip. Return to… home?  
一只企鹅。学校。一拳打在脸上。铃原东治。相田剑介。又一场战斗。逃跑。露营旅行。回到……家？

Another angel. My skin is burning. Ayanami. A shield. Center the target, pull the trigger. Can not fail. She should smile more often. Jet Alone. Rampage. Misato entering the robot. This robot.  
又一个使徒。我的皮肤在燃烧。绫波。一个盾牌。瞄准中心，扣动扳机。不能失败。她应该多笑笑。Jet Alone。暴走。美里进入机器人。这个机器人。

Something is odd. 有些不对劲。  
_  
"Harmonics level raising. Synchronization rate passing the threshold. 50%. 60%. 90%. 110%!"  
"谐波水平提升。同步率越过阈值。50%。60%。90%。110%！"_

_"Power it down. Emergency shutdown!"  
"关闭电源。紧急停机！"_

_"Shutdown signal sent!"  "已发送停机信号！"_

_"Signal not received!" "信号未接收！"_

_"Radio channel also dead!"  
"无线频道也失灵了！"_

_"Ibuki, the pilot's condition is top priority!" –  
""伊吹，飞行员的状态是首要关注！"" –_

the doctor said. 医生说道。

_"Make it faster!" -_ I heard the Lieutenant speaking _- "Is he going to relapse?"_  
"快点！" - 我听到中尉在说话 - "他会复发吗？"

_"End. Repeat the emergency shutdown protocol with double override" –_ said Ibuki.  
"结束。重复紧急关闭协议，双重覆盖" – 伊布说道。

The sea. The sun. Yellow. White. _Doesn't seem like much_. An Angel. Red Unit 01. Ryoji Kaji. Another angel. Dancing with Rei is the key for winning the battle. _Mama_. A volcano. Dive inside it to retrieve an angel. _Dummy. You're really pressing your luck._ A blackout. A Spider. Killed it. _Who knows what they think?_ An Angel falling from the sky. I manage to catch it. A ramen for a reward. _We know how poor you are._  
大海。太阳。黄色。白色。似乎没什么特别的。一个使徒。红色初号机。加持良治。又一个使徒。与绫波共舞是赢得战斗的关键。妈妈。一座火山。潜入其中夺取使徒。傻瓜。你真是自找麻烦。停电了。一只蜘蛛。干掉了它。谁知道它们在想什么？一个从天而降的使徒。我设法接住了它。作为奖励的一碗拉面。我们知道你有多穷。

A virus in the MAGI. Unit 00 going berserk. A shadow dragging me to a place called "Dirac Sea". Toji is a new pilot. The Dummy System injures him because of my inaction. I run away again. Ayanami tries to kill an Angel with a N2 bomb. I return to Nerv. Get trapped inside the Eva. Mother?  
MAGI 系统中的病毒。零号机暴走。一个影子将我拖入名为“狄拉克之海”的地方。真嗣成为新驾驶员。因为我的不作为，Dummy 系统伤了他。我又一次逃跑了。绫波试图用 N2 炸弹消灭使徒。我回到 Nerv。被困在 Eva 里。母亲？

Ayanami kills an angel with the Spear of Longinus. She dies in the next battle. Kaji is dead. Ritsuko and Misato are hiding things from me. Kaworu appears and tells me that I'm worth of his grace. He hijacks Toji's Evangelion. He asks me to kill him.  
绫波用朗基努斯之枪消灭了使徒。她在下一场战斗中牺牲。加持死了。律子和美里对我隐瞒了事情。薰出现并告诉我，我值得他的恩典。他劫持了真嗣的 Eva。他请求我杀了他。

I don't want to live anymore. Soldiers from the JSSDF are trying to kill me. Misato protects me, only to take a bullet to her stomach. She kisses me. A taste of blood. The Eva cages. I hear Ibuki screaming at the ratio. I'm…. late? To do something… _Don't they ever stop!? And I can't even count on that idiot Shinji!_  
我不想再活下去了。JSSDF 的士兵们正试图杀我。美里保护我，却腹部中弹。她吻了我。血的味道。Eva 的牢笼。我听到伊吹在喊着比例。我……迟到了？要做些什么……他们从不停止吗！？我甚至不能指望那个笨蛋真嗣！

The sight of a destroyed Eva. An inhuman scream. And then, nothing.  
一架被毁的 Eva。非人的尖叫。然后，一片寂静。

---

A... familiar ceiling? 一个……熟悉的屋顶？

I guess it means that the test was a failure, as expected. Well, at least they would have no reason to keep me here anymore. So I…  
我想这意味着测试如预期般失败了。好吧，至少他们没有理由再把我留在这里了。所以我……

Wait, what is that feeling on my face?  
等等，我脸上这种感觉是什么？

Tears? 泪水？

I was crying. 我在哭泣。

And weeping profusely. 泪如雨下。

Like I had never cried before. And I couldn't figure out why these tears kept falling.  
仿佛从未如此痛哭过。而我却无法理解，为何这些泪水不断涌出。

I... never felt like this before. A feeling of sadness and emptiness. As if an important part of me had been torn away and lost forever.  
我...从未有过这样的感觉。一种悲伤和空虚交织的情绪。仿佛我生命中重要的一部分被生生撕裂，永远失去了。

I wondered what had happened. It could only be... the test. Yes, during the synchronization test I could see several memories more clearly.  
我不禁思索究竟发生了什么。这只能是因为...那个测试。是的，在同步测试中，我清晰地看到了更多记忆片段。

How could I forget that? Toji, Rei, Kaworu, Misato… I had hurt them all. They died because of me. All the pain. All the suffering. Eva was and always will be a curse! I resolved that I won't pilot again. I would rather die than do that.  
我怎能忘记那些？真嗣、绫波、渚薰、美里...我伤害了他们所有人。他们因我而死。所有的痛苦，所有的苦难。EVA 始终是个诅咒！我下定决心不再驾驶它。我宁愿死去也不愿再经历这一切。

"Nobody is going to force you to do anything, Shinji."  
"没有人会强迫你做任何事，真嗣。"

I shut up immediately upon hearing that voice. Was I speaking all those things out loud? Did they hear me? In any case, it didn't matter anymore. I had already made my decision. They could kill me, but I wouldn't pilot that thing again.  
听到那个声音，我立刻闭上了嘴。我刚才是在大声说出那些话吗？他们听到了吗？无论如何，这都不再重要了。我已经做出了决定。他们可以杀了我，但我不会再驾驶那东西了。

"Hey Shinji. Do you remember me? Remember what happened after your last battle in Eva?"  
"嘿，真嗣。你还记得我吗？记得你在 Eva 的最后一场战斗后发生了什么吗？"

When I looked toward the window, I saw a man, wearing a uniform with various markings and insignia, that made me remember Kensuke's lessons. It meant that this man had a high military rank. And then new memories came to my mind.  
当我望向窗户时，我看到一个身穿带有各种标记和徽章制服的男人，这让我想起了健介的课程。这意味着这个男人拥有很高的军衔。然后，新的记忆涌入我的脑海。

The Japan Strategic Self Defense Force. Flamethrowers. Human bodies on fire. 'Nothing personal, kid'. Gunshots. Misato bleeding.  
日本战略自卫队。火焰喷射器。燃烧的人体。'别怪我，孩子'。枪声。美里流血。

I couldn't do anything but vomit a disgusting green liquid on the room's floor.  
我无能为力，只能在房间的地板上呕吐出令人作呕的绿色液体。

The man came to my side and, calmly taking off his uniform jacket, began to wipe my vomit off the floor. What kind of trick they were planning? Did he think this display of sympathy was going to be enough to make me reconsider my decision?  
那男人走到我身边，平静地脱下制服外套，开始擦拭地板上的呕吐物。他们究竟在策划什么诡计？难道他认为这种同情的表演足以让我重新考虑我的决定吗？

"Shinji. After the last battle... well, things have gotten tough these past few years. Many people understood that most of the world's governments and leaders were manipulated by Seele and the schemes that your father was involved in, using the Evangelions not to protect humanity, but for selfish interests." - the man spoke as he lowered himself to the ground, trying to absorb as much vomit as possible into his jacket, not caring about getting dirty.  
“真嗣。上次战斗之后……嗯，这几年确实很艰难。许多人已经明白，世界上大多数政府和领导人都被 Seele 和你父亲参与的阴谋所操控，他们利用 EVA 不是为了保护人类，而是出于私利。”——男人一边说着，一边蹲下身子，尽可能多地用外套吸收呕吐物，毫不在意自己变得脏兮兮的。

"But other people... even though they got a second chance, they didn't learn anything from... everything that happened. Instead of trying to collaborate to build a better world they returned only to satisfy their selfish desires. Seeing the current state of the world, they did not accept this outcome and began to want revenge. Not only against those responsible for that ending, but against all those they saw as enemies, as if that could change reality and make this destroyed world be like they want it to be."  
"但其他人...即使他们得到了第二次机会，却未从发生的一切中学到任何东西。他们没有努力合作建设一个更美好的世界，而是只顾满足自己的私欲。看到世界的现状，他们不接受这一结果，开始渴望复仇。不仅针对那些导致结局的人，还针对所有他们视为敌人的人，仿佛这样能改变现实，让这个被摧毁的世界变成他们想要的样子。"

"Who... who are you?" "你...你是谁？"

"Commander Amai Yadoraki." - the man replies as he throws his coat into the sink and begins to wash his hands - "I stood as the designated government official after Third Impact to ensure the order of all Japan. And also... the safety of all those who worked for Nerv during the war against the Angels."  
"天城飴司令。"" - 男子回答道，同时将外套扔进水槽，开始洗手 - ""在第三次冲击后，我作为指定的政府官员，确保了整个日本的秩序。同时...也保护了在对抗使徒战争中为 Nerv 工作的所有人。"

"Liar!" - I shouted in anger. "Your people invaded Nerv. You killed Misato! And now you want to use me to be a weapon of war! I won't allow that, I won't." - I froze as I felt his hand gripping my hair tightly. After a few seconds and a few movements, the man released me, and I could see that my hair was tied up, in a sort of ponytail.  
"骗子！" - 我愤怒地喊道。"你们的人入侵了 NERV。你杀了美里！现在你还想利用我成为战争的武器！我不会允许的，绝不。" - 我僵住了，感觉到他的手紧紧抓住我的头发。几秒钟后，他松开了手，我看到我的头发被扎成了一个马尾。

"Shinji. I know it's hard for you to believe people. Even more so a JSSDF soldier. But be assured that I and many others care about you. And we have gone to great lengths to protect you for all these years from those who harbor an irrational hatred for you and would like to see you dead, unhappy or gone forever. They blame the Evangelions and everything related to it for the failures in their lives and for the current state of the world."  
"真嗣，我知道你很难相信别人。尤其是 JSSDF 的士兵。但请放心，我和许多其他人都很关心你。多年来，我们不遗余力地保护你，免受那些对你怀有非理性仇恨、希望你死掉、不快乐或永远消失的人的伤害。他们将生活中的失败和世界的现状归咎于 EVA 以及与之相关的一切。"

I kept quiet. His rhetoric was impressive, but words are just words. Instruments of manipulation. No one has ever known how I feel. No one has ever sought to understand me._"You really think you understand me! You think that you can help me? That is so arrogant! You couldn't possibly understand me!"_  
我保持沉默。他的言辞令人印象深刻，但言语只是言语，是操纵的工具。没有人真正了解我的感受，没有人试图理解我。你真的以为你了解我！你以为你能帮助我？真是太自大了！你不可能理解我！"

My silence was interrupted by a loud noise and a trembling sensation. That sounded like... an Angel attack?  
我的沉默被一声巨响和颤动感打破。那听起来像是……使徒的攻击？

"Our defenses have been breached. Without the use of an AT-Field and without the New Jet Alone's presence on the battlefield, this will all be over in a matter of minutes."  
我们的防线已被突破。没有 AT 力场的保护，战场上也没有新式喷射独行侠的存在，这一切将在几分钟内结束。

I looked into that person's eyes. He didn't seem to be lying. It was a situation similar to that day when I first entered an Evangelion. Only this time I was not going to repeat the same mistake. It is an illusion to think that I can do anything to change fate. After all, doing nothing is sometimes a worse option than trying to do something.  
我凝视着那个人的眼睛。他似乎没有说谎。这情景让我想起了第一次进入 EVA 的那天。但这次我不会重蹈覆辙。以为自己能改变命运只是一种幻觉。毕竟，有时候什么都不做比试图做些什么更糟糕。

"Like I said, Shinji, nobody will force you to do anything. I will not invoke the memory of Misato Katsuragi, Ryoji Kaji or... other pilots in order to make an emotional appeal for you to fight again." - says the man as he heads for the door and pulls out his communicator to give instructions.  
“就像我说的，真嗣，没有人会强迫你做任何事。我不会用葛城美里、加持良治或其他驾驶员的记忆来对你进行情感上的恳求，让你再次战斗。”——男人说着走向门口，掏出通讯器开始下达指令。

I raise my head slightly and watch as the man leaves the room. Before he left, he stopped and looked me in the eye  
我微微抬起头，目送那人离开房间。在他离开前，他停下脚步，直视我的眼睛。

"However, I feel complied to tell you the same words that you've told me on the first time we met. 'The future freaks me out, but even when in doubt where to go, I know that there is a light that never goes out. So, as long as I know that she is somewhere out there, I will take the long and winding road'."  
“然而，我觉得有必要告诉你，我们初次见面时你对我说的那些话：‘未来让我感到恐惧，但即便在迷茫中不知何去何从，我也知道有一束永不熄灭的光。所以，只要我知道她在某个地方，我就会踏上那条漫长而曲折的道路。’”

What?

Were those words that he said... mine? Had I really said that? No, I didn't really remember saying those words. Those sad words seemed like... brave, determined words... words that I really couldn't imagine coming out of my mouth.  
那些话，是他说的...是我的吗？我真的那样说过吗？不，我并不记得自己说过那些话。那些悲伤的话语，似乎是...勇敢而坚定的...我实在难以想象会从我口中说出。

However, those words made me feel again that melancholic feeling of emptiness and an indescribable urge to cry.  
然而，那些话再次唤起了我那种忧郁的空虚感，以及一种难以言喻的哭泣冲动。

But they also awakened another feeling. That something had to be done. That I couldn't just stand there crying and do nothing. Not again. Images of a destroyed Evangelion on the battlefield came to my mind. I want to help… in some way.  
但它们也唤醒了另一种感觉。必须做些什么。我不能只是站在那里哭泣，什么都不做。不能再这样了。战场上被摧毁的 EVA 的画面浮现在脑海中。我想以某种方式提供帮助。

"_Then, don't do anything. Because all you ever do is hurt me."_  
“那么，什么都别做。因为你所做的每一件事，都只会伤害我。”

No.

I quickly stood up, ignoring the dizzy feeling and headed for the door, shouting with all my might a resounding "Wait!"  
我迅速站起身，不顾那阵眩晕感，朝着门口走去，用尽全力大喊一声“等等！”

---

In a matter of minutes, I was back inside the entry plug, to synchronize with the same alien core that almost killed me last time. This time, for real. To fight on the battlefield. But the opponents would not be Angels. They would be other human beings.  
短短几分钟内，我又回到了插入栓里，与上次几乎要了我命的那个异星核心同步。这次，是真的。要上战场了。但对手将不再是使徒，而是其他人类。

Why I decided to do this? I... never wanted to do this... I...  
我为何决定这么做？我...从未想过要这么做...我...

_"Shinji, do you copy me?"_– I could hear Ibuki's voice calling me.  
"真嗣，你能听到吗？"——我听到伊吹的声音在呼唤我。

"Y-yeah... "嗯-嗯...

_"Good. Listen to me. We're going to restrict the sync rate limit to 30% this time, so as to avoid the problem we had last time. You may not be able to move very well with these sync levels, but that's okay. We have positioned ourselves to set up a defense in depth to withstand the attacks. We just need you to try to generate an AT-Field so that we can defend against the bombardments. Since the Jet Alone's power is provided by an internal reactor, you don't have to worry about the time limit. Just do the best you can until your body holds out, okay? Reinforcements are on the way. Good luck, Shinji.  
“很好。听我说，这次我们将同步率限制在 30%，以避免上次出现的问题。在这样的同步水平下，你可能无法自如移动，但没关系。我们已经布置了多层防御来抵御攻击。我们只需要你尽力生成 AT 力场，以便防御炮击。由于 Jet Alone 的动力来自内部反应堆，你不必担心时间限制。尽你所能坚持到身体撑不住为止，好吗？增援正在路上。祝你好运，真嗣。”_

The sunlight blinded me for a few moments. I was prepared to see a war scene, but what I saw made me even more impressed than I imagined.  
阳光刺眼了几秒。我本以为会看到一片战场景象，但眼前所见比我想象的更令人震撼。

The seawater was red, like blood. There was no sign of vegetation, just a devastated and desert landscape. On the horizon, I could see signs of an imminent invasion. Several warships were approaching the shore and some of them firing on the shore.  
海水如血般猩红。没有植被的迹象，只有一片荒废的沙漠景象。在地平线上，我能看到即将入侵的迹象。几艘战舰正逼近海岸，其中一些已经开始向岸上开火。

But fortunately, these conventional weapons presented no risk or threat to an AT-Field.  
但幸运的是，这些常规武器对 AT 力场毫无风险或威胁。

As I concentrated and took a deep breath, I could feel the familiar sensation of the AT-Field projecting from the organic components that were attached to the Jet Alone.  
当我集中精神，深吸一口气时，我能感受到从连接到 Jet Alone 的有机组件中投射出熟悉的 AT 力场的感觉。

Another volley of shots came. All of them were easily barred by the AT-Field. Likewise, the next round of shots didn't even tickle.  
又一轮射击袭来。所有子弹都被 AT 力场轻松阻挡。同样，下一轮射击甚至没有引起一丝波澜。

After a few minutes, the attacks ceased.  
几分钟后，攻击停止了。

_"Shinji... excellent performance." –_I could hear the Commander's voice_– "However, remain in position. It is your presence on the battlefield that is making the difference, but we still have to wait for the reinforcements to arrive to make sure they will retreat, ok? I urge you to hang tight for a little while longer."_  
"真嗣...表现出色。" –我能听到司令的声音– "不过，保持位置。你在战场上的存在正产生着影响，但我们还需等待增援到达，确保他们撤退，好吗？我恳请你再坚持一会儿。"

"Ok... I... I think I can do that."  
"好的...我...我想我能做到。"

I sighed with relief. If everything worked out, I could continue to do my part and simply force them to retreat. I could protect people without hurting anyone. And everything would be solved.  
我松了一口气。如果一切顺利，我可以继续尽我的职责，只需迫使他们撤退。我可以保护人们而不伤害任何人。一切问题都将迎刃而解。

But, as always, this hope was dashed in no time. The warships began to come closer and closer to the shore, and smaller, faster ships began to come closer too. Were they thinking of making a land invasion? If that was the case, I would have to intercept them somehow and in doing so I was going to... kill those people.  
但一如既往，这种希望转瞬即逝。战舰开始越来越靠近海岸，更小、更快的船只也开始逼近。他们是在考虑进行陆地入侵吗？如果是这样，我将不得不设法拦截他们，而这样做我将会... 杀死那些人。

_"What? They are deploying it here, over the sea?"  
“什么？他们在这里，海上部署了它？”_

_"Shinji! Be careful!" "真嗣！小心！"_

I will never forget the scene I witnessed. Something shapeless and gigantic appeared inside the main ship and, disconnecting itself from some sort of rope, took a great leap in the air, landing and destroying several smaller ships as it approached the shore at great speed, until it stopped at the edge of the beach, a few kilometres from where I was.  
我永远无法忘记我所目睹的那一幕。某种无形而巨大的生物出现在主舰内部，它从某种绳索上挣脱，一跃而起，在高速接近海岸的过程中摧毁了数艘小型船只，最终在离我几公里的海滩边缘停了下来。

Only then I could see its real nature.  
直到那时，我才看清它的真实面目。

The figure was humanoid, but it looked like something out of a nightmare. Like it was an Angel. No. It was a little different. It was more like a zombie Evangelion, with remains of organic matter decomposing and its appearance revealing a mixture of bones, tissue and rotting flesh all over its body.  
那身影虽为人形，却似出自噩梦。宛如天使。不，又略有不同。更像是一具僵尸化的福音战士，有机物残骸腐烂分解，全身显露出骨骼、组织与腐肉的混合体。

I should have been frightened by the monstrous figure that was probably deployed there with the goal of killing me. But my mind could only think of something else. A… pleasant feeling?  
面对那具多半被派来取我性命的怪物身影，我本该感到恐惧。然而，我的思绪却飘向了别处。一种……愉悦的感觉？

How? How is it possible that a giant robot like that could move as precisely and gracefully as it just did? That sight gave me a feeling of nostalgia, and soon after, that now familiar feeling of intense and deep sadness.  
怎么可能？那样巨大的机器人，怎会动作如此精准优雅？那一幕勾起了我的怀旧之情，随即而来的，是那熟悉的深沉悲痛。

I could barely react when that monster started running towards me and, in one precise movement, jumped up and planted both his feet in a swift attack that hit Jet Alone directly in its chest.  
当那怪物朝我冲来时，我几乎来不及反应，它以一个精准的动作一跃而起，双脚迅速出击，直接击中了 Jet Alone 的胸口。

I barely had the time to brace myself for the impact. Next thing I remembered, I was watching the world spin as the robot that I was piloting rolled several times on the ground from the force of the impact.  
我几乎没有时间做好迎接冲击的准备。接下来我只记得，我驾驶的机器人因那股冲击力在地上翻滚了好几圈，世界在我眼前旋转。

_"Shinji! Get up! You need to fight back. Otherwise, you will be killed there."  
“真嗣！站起来！你必须反击。否则，你会在那里丧命的。”_

"What... what is that? It's an... Eva?"  
"那...那是什么？是...一个...Eva 吗？"

I got no answer. 我没有得到回答。

"I asked what is that! Is there... someone piloting it?"  
"我问那是什么！里面...有人在驾驶吗？"

I looked up only to see the monster towering over me.  
我抬头一看，只见那怪物正俯视着我。

I guess I deserved that. It was over, I had nothing else to do. I won't fight another pilot. Not after what happened to Toji. And this time the stakes weren't as high. We weren't fighting Angels, but other humans. If we surrendered, sure, it would be bad for everyone involved but the world and mankind would survive.  
我想我活该如此。一切都结束了，我无事可做。我不会再与任何驾驶员战斗。经历了对冬二的事情后，我不会再这样做了。而且这次的风险没有那么高。我们不是在与天使战斗，而是与其他人类。如果我们投降，当然，这对所有人都不利，但世界和人类将会幸存。

I felt a kick on my head. Then another. Why? The Zombie Eva wasn't going for the kill? It was… mocking me? I could swear that this thing was looking at me in a way that expressed plain disgust.  
我感到头部被踢了一脚。接着又是一脚。为什么？僵尸 EVA 不打算杀我吗？它在……嘲笑我？我敢肯定，这东西看着我的眼神充满了明显的厌恶。

"_Shinji, fight back! Remember that the Jet Alone doesn't have a time limit for operation, but this enemy does."_  
“真嗣，反击！记住，Jet Alone 没有操作时间限制，但这个敌人有。”

He was right! I could win this fight and without killing anyone. I just needed to wait until the internal batteries of this Zombie Eva ran out.  
他说得对！我可以赢得这场战斗，而且不会伤害任何人。我只需要等到这台僵尸 EVA 的内部电池耗尽。

I tried to get up, but my opponent soon realized my attempt and applied another strong direct hit to Jet Alone's right shoulder, which made me fall again.  
我试图站起来，但对手很快察觉了我的意图，对 Jet Alone 的右肩施加了又一次强力直接打击，使我再次倒下。

I rolled to the side again, trying to distance myself, but it was useless. The Zombie Eva, although smaller than the Jet Alone, was faster and its pilot was extremely skilled.  
我再次向旁边翻滚，试图拉开距离，但这一切都是徒劳。僵尸初号机虽然比飞翼零式小，速度却更快，而且它的驾驶员技艺极其高超。

Every time I tried to get up, I was again surprised by another blow that threw me back to the ground.  
每次我试图起身，都会被另一记重击再次击倒在地，令我震惊不已。

It was impossible. I could not beat this pilot, even more so with such a low synchronization rate.  
这不可能。我无法战胜这位驾驶员，更何况是在同步率如此低的情况下。

But... this time I didn't have to win. I just needed to... keep running away! It was only a matter of hanging in there for a few more minutes until it was all over.  
但...这次我不必取胜。我只需要...继续逃跑！只要再坚持几分钟，一切就会结束。

I kept rolling and threatening to get up, but no longer with any real intention of doing so. I needed to hold on a little longer... just a little longer.  
我继续滚动并威胁要站起来，但不再有任何真正的意图这样做。我需要再坚持一会儿...只要再一会儿。

However, something strange happened. The monster stopped attacking me, as if it was trapped in a trance. I took advantage of this moment to finally get up. Now that the Jet Alone was on its feet it would be easier to make it through to the end...  
然而，发生了奇怪的事情。怪物停止攻击我，仿佛陷入了恍惚。我趁机终于站了起来。现在 Jet Alone 也站起来了，要撑到结束会更容易些...

My trail of thoughts was broken by another precise and violent attack from the Zombie Eva directly against Jet Alone's chest. This time my opponent was determined not to give me any chance, having fallen on top of me and trying to get me pined and immobilized. It seemed as if...  
我的思绪被僵尸 Eva 又一次精准而猛烈的攻击打断了，这次它直接击中了 Jet Alone 的胸口。这次我的对手决心不给我任何机会，她压在我身上，试图将我钉住并固定。似乎...

A violent punch was landed against the concentrated organic matter on Jet Alone's face. Right where my entry plug was. The impact of the blow was so brutal that I could feel the deflection of pressure from the LCL, as part of the plug had been dented by the attack. The force of the impact left me disoriented and on the verge of passing out.  
一记猛烈的拳头击中了 Jet Alone 脸上的密集有机物质，正好对着我的插入栓位置。这一击的冲击力极其残酷，我能感受到 LCL 中压力的偏转，因为插入栓的一部分被攻击撞凹了。冲击的力量让我感到眩晕，几乎要昏过去。

My foe was determined to kill me. Damn it. I was so close. If only I had a little more energy. If only I wasn't such a coward. If only I hadn't done anything while she was fighting... she? Who is…  
我的敌人决心要置我于死地。该死。我差点就成功了。如果我有更多的能量。如果我不是这么懦弱。如果我没有在她战斗时做任何事...她？是谁…

_"Shinji!" “真嗣！”_

_"Synchronization rate has surpassed the threshold barrier. 50%-90%-130% and rising!"  
"同步率已突破阈值屏障。50%-90%-130%，并持续上升！"_

_"Is it another relapse?" "又是一次复发吗？"_

The punch landed by Zombie Eva came at great speed, but I was easily able to stop it with Jet Alone's palm, crushing the fingers of my opponent, who I could notice that was visibly surprised with the turn of events.  
僵尸绫波的这一拳速度极快，但我轻松地用 Jet Alone 的掌心挡下，碾碎了对手的手指，我能注意到她对事态的转变明显感到惊讶。

I liked the feeling. He was scared. Like a prey. I would hurt him. I would kill him.  
我喜欢这种感觉。他害怕了。像猎物一样。我会伤害他。我会杀了他。

In one swift movement, I was able to reverse our positions on the ground, positioning Jet Alone on top of the struggling opponent.  
我迅速一转，便将我们的位置颠倒，让 Jet Alone 压在挣扎的对手上方。

My hands held the opponent by the neck, pressing it hard. In a matter of a few seconds Zombie Eva stopped moving at all.  
我的双手紧紧掐住对手的脖子，用力压迫。几秒钟内，Zombie Eva 就完全停止了动弹。

But I kept pressing my opponent's neck even harder.  
但我仍不断加重按压对手颈部的力度。

I could feel my hands and nails digging into her flesh as I looked at her blue eyes... while her hand tried to reach my face and...  
我能感觉到我的手和指甲深深陷入她的肉里，凝视着她蓝色的眼睛……而她的手试图伸向我的脸，并且……

A flash. And then, nothing.  
一道闪光。接着，一片空白。

### Chapter 3 Kimochi Warui

_"Is she alive?"_ - I heard the voice of a woman asking.  
“她还活着吗？”——我听到一个女人的声音在问。

_"Affirmative, Commander. Her physical body is presenting regular pattern orange and vital signs are stable."_ - A male voice responded.  
"是的，指挥官。她的身体呈现正常模式橙色，生命体征稳定。" - 一个男声回应道。

_"Thank God. Jason, is there any signs of mental contamination?"  
"谢天谢地。杰森，有没有精神污染的迹象？"_

_"Well, the brain signals are also stable and there are no signs of any physical harm. But the readings show that there are some anomalies in her brain patterns. They are under control at the moment, but they may escalate quickly, causing permanent damage in the long term. Like what happened to..."  
"嗯，脑电波也很稳定，没有发现任何身体伤害的迹象。但读数显示她的脑部模式存在一些异常。目前这些异常还在控制之中，但它们可能会迅速升级，长期下去可能导致永久性损伤。就像之前发生过的..."_

_"As long as she is still able to pilot, it's not an issue."  
"只要她还能驾驶，那就不是问题。"_

- a third voice. A frightening and... familiar one?  
- 第三个声音。一个令人恐惧且...熟悉的声音？

_"You... you knew that the procedure wasn't safe. You almost killed her and all of us. If it wasn't for the safety measures it would be a disaster, just like it happened in Nevada!"  
"你...你知道那个手术并不安全。你差点害死了她，还有我们所有人。如果不是因为安全措施，那将是一场灾难，就像在内华达发生的那样！"_

_"It was expressly stated that that procedure involved risk, especially for the pilot. And she consented to it. She volunteered. It's not my fault if she failed to_ _read the fine print."_  
"明确规定了该程序存在风险，尤其是对飞行员而言。而她同意了，她自愿的。如果她没仔细阅读细则，那不是我的错。"

_"What? You're talking about consent, now? She is still a child!"  
"什么？你现在谈同意？她还是个孩子！"_

_"Her age is irrelevant. She is a pilot and nothing else. Always has been. Considering the records and what she said in the last recorded battle, she would rather die trying to succeed in a mission than to back off a challenge. Quite different from that other pilot and exactly what the world needs right now. People willing to make sacrifices to ensure the survival of mankind. Don't you agree, Commander?"  
"她的年龄无关紧要。她是一名飞行员，仅此而已。一直以来都是。从记录和她上次战斗中的发言来看，她宁愿冒险尝试完成任务，也不愿退缩。这与另一位飞行员截然不同，正是当今世界所需要的——那些愿意做出牺牲以确保人类生存的人。你不这么认为吗，指挥官？"_

_"You..." "你..."_

_"Either way. The experiment was a failure as we couldn't get the S2 engine to activate properly. It seems that we will need to add more of the substance to the subject to make it work. I will ask the committee to try the diplomatic approach, but when the_ _Division Bell_ _inevitably rings, we will have to be prepared for other measures."_  
"无论如何。实验失败了，因为我们无法正确激活 S2 引擎。看来我们需要在实验对象中加入更多物质才能使其运作。我会请求委员会尝试外交途径，但当《分界钟声》不可避免地响起时，我们必须准备好采取其他措施。"

Footsteps. A door closing. Silence.  
脚步声。门关闭。寂静无声。

The sound of a gun being loaded.  
枪械上膛的声音。

_"Avil, where..." “Avil，哪里...”_

_"I'm going to Japan." "“我要去日本。””_

_"Are you crazy?" "你疯了吗？"_

_"We need to anticipate his next moves and fight against this conspiracy. I'll go with Jason, and I will also need agents Dan, Yubi and Acqua to come with me. We have to inform Yuko about the true nature of this project and try to avoid the worst-case scenario."  
"我们必须预判他的下一步行动，并反击这个阴谋。我会和杰森一起去，还需要丹、尤比和阿奎亚跟我一起。我们必须向优子揭露这个项目的真实本质，并尽力避免最坏的情况发生。"_

_"And while you are going to this suicide mission what I'm supposed to do?"  
"而当你们去执行这个自杀任务时，我该做什么？"_

_"What you have been done all that time, Commander. Take care of the Sohryu kid."  
"指挥官，您这段时间一直在做的事情，就是照顾好那个相龙家的孩子。"_

'What is that? Sunlight? It hurts... my head feels... strange.'  
'那是什么？阳光吗？好刺眼...我的头感觉...好奇怪。'

'Why am I crying? I decided that I would not cry anymore.'  
'我为什么在哭？我决定过不再哭泣的。'

'I feel… sick. What a disgusting feeling.'  
“我感觉……恶心。这种感觉真令人作呕。”

'Where I am? _I'm not here._ Where are… you?'  
“我在哪里？我不在这里。你……你在哪儿？”

"Asuka... are you ok?" - I turned to see the source of the voice. A woman, wearing a white coat was standing right behind of the machine that monitored my vital signs.  
“明日香……你还好吗？”——我转身看向声音的来源。一位身穿白大褂的女性正站在监测我生命体征的机器后面。

"Who the heck are you? And what am I doing here?"  
"你到底是谁？我在这里做什么？"

"P-please calm down Asuka... It's natural that you are feeling confused right now, but we are here to help you." - said a woman with a black suit who was standing by the door.  
"请冷静下来，明日香...你现在感到困惑是很正常的，但我们在这里是为了帮助你。" 一位穿着黑色西装的女士站在门口说道。

Help me? The idea made me angry. I never needed help. Certainly not from them. Not from anyone.  
帮助我？这个想法让我生气。我从不需要帮助。当然不是来自他们。不是来自任何人。

"Tell me, Asuka... what is the last thing you remember?" - the doctor said, with a look of concern in her eyes.  
"告诉我，明日香...你记得的最后一件事是什么？" - 医生说道，眼中流露出关切的神情。

"I..." - the pain in my head intensifies. "Kaji. My Unit 2. W... what happened?"  
"我..." - 头部的疼痛加剧了。"加持。我的二号机。发...发生了什么？"

The two women looked at each other in astonishment. I could notice that they were hiding something and certainly arranging some convenient lie between them. But it didn't matter. They won't fool me, ever. I would get out of here and then…  
两位女士惊讶地对视了一眼。我能察觉到她们在隐瞒什么，显然是在编造一些方便的谎言。但这无关紧要。她们骗不了我，永远不会。我会离开这里，然后…

"Asuka... to say it all in short terms, we… have lost. Third Impact happened." - the doctor said.  
"明日香...简而言之，我们...已经失败了。第三次冲击发生了。" 医生说道。

My heart stopped for a few seconds. What did she mean? we lost? Was I... have been defeated? After having prepared myself for this my whole life?  
我的心跳停了几秒。她是什么意思？我们输了？我...被打败了吗？在为这一刻准备了一生之后？

"You've got to be kidding. It's a lie, isn't it? It has to be a lie! Where is Kaji? I want to see him now."  
"你一定是在开玩笑。这是假的，对吧？一定是假的！加持在哪里？我现在就要见他。"

"Asuka..." "明日香……"

"ENOUGH!" - I said, getting up from the bed while removing the oximeter and other equipment that was reading my vital signs, also knocking over a metal tray that contained some medicines and notes.  
“够了！”——我喊道，从床上起身，同时摘下血氧仪和其他监测生命体征的设备，还碰翻了一个装有药品和笔记的金属托盘。

Only to fall to the floor soon after, without the strength to get up. The black suited woman came toward me to help me up, ignoring my attempts to push her away.  
结果没过多久就无力地摔倒在地，无法起身。那位身着黑色西装的女士朝我走来，试图扶我起来，无视我推开她的努力。

"Asuka... a lot of time has passed since Third Impact happened. We haven't heard anything from Kaji in years."  
“明日香……自从第三次冲击发生后，已经过去很久了。我们已经有好几年没有收到加持的任何消息了。”

Years? 几年？

"Leave. Me. Alone!" I screamed while I was trying to disengage myself from the woman's grapple.  
“走开！别管我！”我尖叫着，试图挣脱那女人的纠缠。

'No. No . NO! It's just another nightmare... it can't be real... if we lost the war, it means that I've failed as an Eva pilot. And if I've also lost Kaji, then... then... what's left for me?'  
“不，不，不！这只是另一个噩梦……这不可能是真的……如果我们输了战争，那就意味着我作为 Eva 驾驶员失败了。如果连我也失去了加持，那么……那么……我还剩下什么？”

I looked at the metal tray on the floor. It was like staring at a mirror, and therefore I could see the reflection of my face.  
我看着地板上的金属托盘。它就像一面镜子，因此我能看到自己脸庞的倒影。

Ruined. 毁了。

Scarred. 伤痕累累。

Like a freak. 像个怪胎。

At that moment, I realized that I have really lost everything.  
那一刻，我意识到我真的失去了一切。

Asuka Langley Sohryu was dead.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷已经死了。

And nobody would care about it.  
而且没人会在意这件事。

Nobody would help me. 没人会帮我。

_Help me, Asuka. You're the only one who can.  
帮帮我，明日香。只有你能帮我了。_

---

I woke up again. This time there was no sunlight to bother me and I realized that it should be nighttime already.  
我又一次醒来。这次没有阳光打扰我，我意识到已经是夜晚了。

I looked at the door. The black suited woman was still there. And sitting by my side was the doctor again.  
我望向门口。那位身着黑衣的女士依然在那里。坐在我身旁的又是那位医生。

"Hello, Asuka." "你好，明日香。"

I didn't answer. 我没有回答。

"Sorry for what happened earlier today. Let's try to start over, ok?"  
“对不起，今天早上的事。我们重新开始，好吗？”

I ignored her and pretended to be trying to sleep again.  
我无视她，假装再次试图入睡。

"I'm Dr. Arin, from New Euronerv. I'm in charge of taking care of your health. That girl over there is our Section 2 agent, code-name CC, and she is responsible for your protection."  
"我是来自新欧罗纳维的阿林博士，负责照顾您的健康。那边那位是我们第二部门的特工，代号 CC，她负责您的安全保护。"

Euronerv? Protection? It could only mean that. Yes. I was still a pilot. I was going to pilot Eva again. So, everything would be ok.  
欧罗纳维？保护？这只能意味着一件事。是的。我仍然是一名驾驶员。我将再次驾驶 Eva。所以，一切都会好起来的。

But I wasn't willing to let them get the upper hand.  
但我并不愿意让他们占上风。

"Whatever." I said, remaining with my stoic posture, without showing any kind of emotion.  
“随便。”我保持僵硬的姿态，没有流露任何情感。

"Hey, Asuka" – the agent said while also coming closer - "I know that things have not been easy to you but I want you to know that you're not alone. You must be hungry, aren't you?"  
“嘿，明日香”——特工边说边走近——“我知道这些日子对你来说不容易，但我想让你知道你并不孤单。你一定饿了，对吧？”

I was about to object, but she was right. And it was only after she mentioned it that I noticed that there was some kind of a dessert on the table near my bed.  
我正要反驳，但她说的没错。直到她提起，我才注意到床边的桌上放着某种甜点。

"What is this?" “这是什么？”

"Oh, it's _Baumkuchen_! I've made it myself. I don't know much about your tastes, but I guessed that you would like it since it's a popular dish both here and in Japan."  
"哦，这是年轮蛋糕！我自己做的。我不太了解你的口味，但我猜你会喜欢，因为它在这里和日本都很受欢迎。"

'What joke was that? I've never heard about this thing before. From the looks of it, it seems like it's tasty, but this name sounds kind of…. dumb?'  
'那是什么玩笑？我以前从没听说过这东西。看样子似乎挺好吃的，但这名字听起来有点……傻乎乎的？'

"I'm not hungry."- I said, in an unconvincingly way.  
"我不饿。"——我这么说，语气却毫无说服力。

"Come on, give it a try. I will help you to cheer up a little bit."  
"来吧，试试看。我会帮你振作一点。"

I hesitated for a moment, but eventually picked up the fork and tried to chew a piece of the candy. I looked like it was really delicious.  
我犹豫了一会儿，但最终还是拿起叉子，尝试着咬了一口糖果。我看起来好像它真的很好吃。

It was a big mistake. I could tell that everything was right. The texture, the smell.. but... I just couldn't feel the taste the food.  
这是个巨大的错误。我能感觉到一切都很对。质地，气味.. 但是...我就是尝不出食物的味道。

In fact, I felt that my esophagus and stomach were rejecting the food.  
事实上，我感觉我的食道和胃都在抗拒这些食物。

With an impulsive and sudden movement, I pushed the table away from me, making its contents fall on the floor breaking the plate and causing the dessert to splatter, resulting in a huge mess.  
我一时冲动，猛地将桌子从我面前推开，桌上的东西随之掉落在地，盘子碎裂，甜点四溅，一片狼藉。

The two women looked at me in shock.  
那两位女士震惊地看着我。

"Well... Asuka...I'm... I'm sorry that you didn't like it." – the doctor said, sobbing, while she started to run away from the room.  
“呃... 明日香...我...我很抱歉你不喜欢。” – 医生哽咽着说，随即开始逃离房间。

Why? Why she was sorry about it? I was the one to blame. Sorry…. This word was so annoying. So irritating. It made me even more angry.  
为什么？她为什么要为此道歉？该道歉的是我。抱歉…这个词真烦人。如此令人恼火。它让我更加愤怒。

I shouted in frustration and threw the fork on the wall.  
我沮丧地大喊，并将叉子扔向墙壁。

"Asuka, are you…" "明日香，你是在……"

"LEAVE ME ALONE!" – I shouted at the agent.  
"别管我！" – 我对着特工大喊。

After a moment of silence, she gave me a sad smile and returned to her stand by position outside the room, resuming her guard duties without saying anything for the rest of the night.  
沉默片刻后，她给了我一个悲伤的微笑，回到房间外的待命位置，整晚默默地继续她的警卫职责，未再发一言。

_I will think by myself, and I will live by myself. I don't need Daddy or Mama. I will live alone.  
我会独立思考，我会独自生活。我不需要爸爸或妈妈。我将独自一人。_

---

At the next morning, CC guided me through the facility until we reached the command center, which made me feel a sensation of déjà vu.  
第二天早上，CC 带我穿过设施，直到我们到达指挥中心，这让我产生了一种似曾相识的感觉。

As we got there, a woman with an imposing presence walked towards us.  
我们到达时，一位气场强大的女士向我们走来。

"Hello, Asuka." "你好，明日香。"

"Am I supposed to know you?" – I answered in a rougher way than it was necessary.  
"我应该认识你吗？" – 我的回答比必要的还要粗鲁。

The woman maintained her façade of authority, but I got the feeling that she wasn't expecting that answer and was somehow disappointed with that.  
那女人保持着她的权威姿态，但我感觉到她没料到这样的回答，某种程度上感到失望。

"Oh, yes. I've been informed of your… condition. I'm Commander Amelie Sabo and this is Operations Chief, Holly."  
"哦，是的。我已经得知了你的……状况。我是指挥官阿梅丽·萨博，这位是作战主任霍莉。"

"Hi Asuka. Today we are going to make another synchronization test with the new Evangelion prototype, ok?".  
"嗨，明日香。今天我们要和新的 EVA 原型机进行另一次同步测试，好吗？"

It was only at this moment that I've turned my attention to the cages' area, where I could see a terrifying image.  
直到这时，我才将注意力转向笼子区域，那里我看到了一幅可怕的景象。

That Evangelion looked like it was a monster. It looked like Unit 2, but instead of it being a robot, it was a giant human body in a decomposing state, showing its bones, tissue and rotting flesh.  
那台 EVA 看起来像是个怪物。它看起来像是 2 号机，但不是机器人，而是一个处于腐烂状态的巨大人体，显露出骨头、组织和腐肉。

'I'm... piloting one of those things?'  
'我...在驾驶其中一台那种东西？'

"It is…. smaller than Unit 02." – I said, trying to keep calm and don't show weakness.  
“它……比 2 号机小。”——我尽量保持冷静，不显露软弱。

"Oh… Yeah, it is, indeed. But I guess that you will handle this Petit Eva just as fine as you handled the old Unit 02. Don't worry about it." – the Commander said with a soft laugh.  
"哦…是的，确实如此。但我想你处理这台小型 EVA 会和处理旧的 02 号机一样得心应手。别担心。" – 指挥官轻声笑着说。

---

_"Ready for activation!" "准备激活！"_

_"Begin test! All power systems engaged!"  
"开始测试！所有动力系统启动！"_

_"Pressure values normal. Starting synchronization with the pilot".  
"压力值正常。开始与驾驶员同步。"_

_"All harmonics nominal. Self-psychograph stabilizing. Synchronization rate reaching critical levels and raising at the rate of 1% per second."  
"所有谐波正常。自我心理图谱稳定。同步率已达临界水平，并以每秒 1%的速度上升。"  
_

I felt something coming straight into my head.  
我感觉有什么东西直冲我的脑海。

A huge battleship. Misato was there. My first real battle was against a fish-like angel. If _we don't pry its mouth open, we're gonna get blown up with it!_ A penguin. School. The First Child. Hikari. Another angel, killed in a clean way with a swift attack. _That wasn't bad_. I caught an angel inside of a volcano. _Thermal expansion?_  
一艘巨大的战舰。美里在那里。我的第一场真正战斗是对抗一个鱼形使徒。如果我们不撬开它的嘴，就会和它一起被炸飞！一只企鹅。学校。第一适任者。光。另一个使徒，被干净利落地一击毙命。那还不错。我在火山内部捕获了一个使徒。热膨胀？

A Spider. Killed it. _Why the Angels keep attacking us?_ An Angel falling from the sky. I manage to kill it. A ramen for a reward. _I think I finally understood the good part of being praised by someone.  
一只蜘蛛。干掉了它。为什么使徒不断攻击我们？一个从天而降的使徒。我设法干掉了它。作为奖励的一碗拉面。我想我终于明白了被某人赞扬的美好之处。  
_  
A weird angel projected a shadow that absorbed things. Killed with an explosion. A rogue Evangelion, neutralized. A monster Angel, that was really strong. I lost my two arms before Wondergirl finished him with an N2 Mine.  
一个奇怪的使徒投射出吸收物体的影子。用爆炸消灭了它。一架失控的 EVA，被中和了。一个非常强大的怪物使徒。在明日香用 N2 地雷终结它之前，我失去了双臂。

Another angel… it was invading me. Ripping my mind. Violating me. Save me, Mr. Kaji! What? You won't do it? Who is this…  
又一个天使……它正在侵入我。撕裂我的意识。侵犯我。救救我，加持先生！什么？你不会这么做？这人是谁……

I started to lose consciousness as I heard the Commander's voice on the radio screaming.  
我开始失去意识，听到指挥官在无线电里尖叫。

_"Power it down. Emergency shutdown! It's settled! We will fix the theoretical threshold at the hard coded limit of 50% to preserve the pilot."  
关闭电源。紧急停机！就这么定了！我们将理论阈值固定在 50%的硬编码限制，以保护驾驶员。_

'You know, don't you? All about me.'  
'你知道的，对吧？关于我的一切。'

---

Apparently, since that last test, they decided that the Evangelion wasn't safe enough for proper activation.  
显然，自从上次测试后，他们认为 EVA 的安全性不足以进行正常启动。

So, in each mission, I was always deployed in a defensive role.  
因此，在每次任务中，我总是被部署在防御位置。

My orders consisted in generating an AT Field strong enough to protect the tropes against the enemies' attacks. This was a joke. Even a kid could do this kind of job.  
我的任务是生成一个足够强大的 AT 力场，以保护那些套路不受敌人攻击。这简直是笑话。就连小孩都能胜任这种工作。

I didn't know who we where fighting and where we were fighting, but I didn't care at all.  
我不知道我们在和谁战斗，也不知道战斗地点在哪里，但我一点也不在乎。

Every time was almost the same situation: an improvised army trying to defend a position on a desolated and deserted scenario.  
每次情况几乎都如出一辙：一支临时拼凑的军队试图在一个荒凉且无人之地坚守阵地。

After all of those missions, I always returned to the base and went straight to my quarters.  
经历了那么多任务，我总是回到基地，直奔我的宿舍。

I knew that I would never have a normal life again. Even piloting Eva and being recognized for it no longer gave me any pleasurable feelings.  
我知道我再也无法过上正常的生活了。即便是驾驶 Eva 并因此受到认可，也不再给我带来任何愉悦感。

All those mundane things of ordinary life, which every teenage girl would dream of having, no longer interested me.  
那些普通生活中平凡的事物，每个少女都梦想拥有的，对我来说已不再有吸引力。

I was no longer able to take pleasure in eating anything, despite of Arin's efforts, or even in playing the video games that CC found a way to give to me.  
尽管 Arin 费尽心思，甚至 CC 找到了办法给我送来电子游戏，我再也无法从任何食物或游戏中找到乐趣。

No matter how much they tried to cheer me up, I just knew that not only my mind, but also my body, were destroyed forever. I wouldn't ever be the same again.  
无论他们如何努力让我振作，我心里清楚，不仅是我的心灵，我的身体也永远被摧毁了。我再也不会是原来的我了。

I guess that my outer appearance finally revealed what I always have been inside: a person full of scars and whose bigger quality is to hurt other and cause fear and terror into other people. A devil. A broken devil.  
我想我的外在终于暴露了我内心的真实：一个满是伤痕的人，最大的特质就是伤害他人，制造恐惧和恐怖。一个恶魔。一个破碎的恶魔。

And after a few months, things were only tumbling down.  
几个月后，情况只是不断恶化。

"Asuka, calm down." "明日香，冷静点。"

"I will not! Just give me the damn pills already!" – I said, while holding my eye-patch. "I'm going insane! I can't sleep anymore! I can't taste food anymore! I'm scarred! I hate everybody! You are a doctor, for God's sake! What have you done with me?"  
"我不会冷静的！快把那该死的药给我！" – 我说着，同时紧握着眼罩。"我快疯了！我再也睡不着了！我尝不出食物的味道了！我被吓坏了！我恨所有人！看在上帝的份上，你是个医生！你对我做了什么？"

"Asuka… please…" "明日香…求你了…"

The more she tried to talk to me, with a calm voice and the best intentions, the more I was sure that I was at my limit and about to snap again.  
她越是试图用平静的语气和最好的意图与我交谈，我就越确信自己已经到了极限，随时可能再次爆发。

CC moved towards us. "Hey, Asuka. Arin is right, you know? We don't know why those things are happening to you and we can't know how hard it can be to be an Eva pilot at such a young age, but…."  
CC 朝我们走来。"嘿，明日香。亚林说得对，你知道吗？我们不知道那些事情为什么会发生在你身上，也不知道在这么小的年纪成为 Eva 驾驶员有多难，但是…."

I looked at her and flinched as she gently took my hair and started to braid it.  
我看着她，当她轻柔地握住我的头发开始编辫子时，我不由得缩了一下。

"W-what are you doing?" “你、你在干什么？”

"Well, I kind envy your hair, you know? It's so beautiful, even after being soaked in LCL. You should try to do something different with it sometimes."  
“嗯，我有点羡慕你的头发，你知道吗？它那么美丽，即使在 LCL 中浸泡过。你应该偶尔尝试一下不同的发型。”

"CC is right, Asuka! I'm thinking about a hairstyle that will look great on you. Would you allow us to do it for you? Think about it as a good lucky charm for tomorrow's mission"  
CC 说得对，明日香！我在考虑一个适合你的发型，会让你看起来很棒。你愿意让我们为你做吗？就当是明天任务的一个好运气符吧。

"Eeeh? I don't…. I mean, you don't have to…. Oh…. Alright. Do whatever you want." – I said, resigned, while looking away from them, feeling a faint blush on my cheeks.  
“诶？我不……我的意思是，你们不必……哦……好吧。随你们怎么弄。” 我无奈地说道，目光移开，脸上泛起淡淡的红晕。

Why am I doing that? It's not like I would to see the result. Or want anybody to…. look at me.  
我为什么要这么做？又不是我想看到结果。或者希望任何人……看我。

_Why are you there?! You won't do anything! You won't help me! You won't even hold me!  
你为什么在那里？！你什么都不会做！你不会帮我！你甚至不会抱我！_

I said nothing else at them for the rest of the night, but allowed them to proceed in doing what they wanted to do with my hair.  
那一晚我再没对他们说什么，只是任由他们继续摆弄我的头发。

Even thought I knew that all of their care, advice and trust wouldn't be able to fix the ugliness that I have inside of me.  
尽管我知道，他们所有的关心、建议和信任都无法治愈我内心深处的丑陋。

---

Once again, I wasn't able to sleep for more than a few minutes that night.  
那一夜，我再次无法连续入睡超过几分钟。

Under normal conditions, this might have been justified because of the impending battle, but I knew that this is not the case. I was sure that there was something wrong with me and that it would be only a matter of time before I lose my sanity for good.  
在正常情况下，这或许可以理解为即将到来的战斗所致，但我清楚事实并非如此。我确信自己出了问题，而且距离彻底丧失理智只是时间问题。

With these thoughts in my head, I was heading for the cages to pilot that freaky Evangelion again when I noticed that there was another person there.  
带着这些念头，我正前往驾驶舱再次操控那台诡异的 EVA，却注意到那里还有另一个人。

"Commander?" “指挥官？”

"Hey Asuka. How are you feeling today?"  
"嘿，明日香。今天感觉怎么样？"

"Like a piece of crap. As always." – I responded.  
"跟垃圾一样。一如既往。" – 我回答道。

She looked at me with a poker face, but I was able to noticed a faint trace of confusion and maybe even sadness on her face.  
她面无表情地看着我，但我注意到她脸上掠过一丝困惑，甚至可能是悲伤。

"About today's mission I would like to say that… well…"  
"关于今天的任务，我想说……嗯……"

I looked at her, as the confident woman struggled to find he words that she wanted to say.  
我看着她，这位自信的女性努力寻找着她想说的话。

"Just don't overdo yourself. At the end of the day, the only thing that really matter and that we will work hard for it is to find a way to ensure that you will be able to return safe and be ok, Asuka."  
"只是别太勉强自己。到了最后，真正重要且我们会为之努力的事情，就是找到确保你能安全归来并安然无恙的方法，明日香。"  
_  
Shut up! What you called ok? I rather prefer to die than this. I hate, hate, everyone, everything!  
闭嘴！你所谓的‘可以’是什么意思？我宁愿死也不要这样。我恨，恨所有人，所有事！_

Several seconds passed by, without an annoying silence. After a while, she turned back and started to walk away from  
几秒钟过去了，伴随着令人烦躁的沉默。过了一会儿，她转过身，开始远离……

As soon as the Commander was out of my sigh, I could only mumble a sound that wouldn't ever be heard by anyone.  
指挥官一离开我的视线，我只能咕哝一声，那声音绝不会被任何人听见。

"Thank you." “谢谢。”

---

_"Asuka, are you ready?"  
“明日香，你准备好了吗？”  
_  
"What kind of dumb question is this? Of course, I'm."  
"这是什么蠢问题？当然，我是。"

_"Alright. Keep on standby. We are vulnerable at that moment because we are crossing the ocean and are going to engage in combat, so just be prepared to deploy your AT-Field if they try to attack us as we prepare for_ _tacking starboard__. Over and out."_  
"好的。保持待命状态。我们那时很脆弱，因为正在跨海并准备投入战斗，所以如果他们在我们准备转向右舷时试图攻击，准备好部署你的 AT 力场。完毕。"

I didn't know why but, this time, Holly didn't close up my communication channel to the base after the call.  
我不知道为什么，但这次，霍莉没有在通话后关闭我与基地的通信频道。

I could hear some faint sounds of battle in the background and several people saying technical stuff that I wasn't really paying attention to.  
我听到背景中隐约传来战斗的声响，还有几个人在说些技术性的东西，我并没有太在意。

But I could realize that something was wrong. This was taking too long…  
但我能意识到有些不对劲。这拖得太久了……

After several minutes of silence, I could hear a voice speaking loud and clear near the radio.  
在几分钟的沉默后，我听到一个声音在电台旁清晰响亮地说话。

_"So, this_ _masquerade_ _ends here. As expected, Nerv has used the remaining of usable Adamnite cells to creat a functional core structure that is able to synchronize with a pilot and generate an AT-Field. But to get viable pilott… the only way that they could've done that in such a tight schedule was because the information that Avil and the others had leaked to them. Right, Commander?"  
“那么，这场假面舞会就此落幕。不出所料，Nerv 利用剩余的可用的亚当之核细胞，创造了一个能与驾驶员同步并生成 AT 力场的核心结构。但要找到合适的驾驶员……在如此紧迫的时间内，他们能做到这一点，只能是因为 Avil 和其他人泄露给他们的信息。对吧，指挥官？”_  
'An AT field? Does that mean there's a human pilot inside that robot?'  
“AT 力场？那意味着那台机器人里有一个人类驾驶员吗？”  
_  
"I don't need to answer to your stupid and non-sense ranting." –  
“我不需要回答你那愚蠢且无意义的咆哮。” ——_I heard Comma… Amelie's voice resounding on the radio system - _"The fact is that we aren't prepared to face a thing like that, and they have the defensive advantage here, since we cannot hurt that robot with conventional weapons and can't deploy an Evangelion at the sea. We have to withdraw."_  
我听到科玛……阿梅莉的声音在无线电系统中回响——“事实是我们尚未准备好面对这样的东西，而且他们在这里拥有防御优势，因为我们无法用常规武器伤害那个机器人，也无法在海上部署 EVA。我们必须撤退。”

_"No, it's quite the opposite, Commander. The whole goal of this operation was to retrieve the remaining's of functional Adamnite cells. And they are giving it to us. We are gonna strike right now and activate_ _Plan-E__."_  
“不，恰恰相反，指挥官。这次行动的全部目标就是回收剩余的功能性亚当细胞。而他们正在把它们交给我们。我们现在就要出击，启动 E 计划。”

_"You… you are planning to retrieve the core and try to activate the S2 engine right here right now? This is insane!"  
“你……你打算在这里立刻回收核心并尝试激活 S2 引擎？这太疯狂了！”_

_"Irrelevant. Once this mission is over, we are going to testimony the greatest thing ever made with an Evangelion for the sake of mankind."  
"无关紧要。一旦这次任务结束，我们将用 EVA 为人类见证有史以来最伟大的创举。"_

_"You mean_ _genocide__, Rokobungi! You're willing to destroy all of Japan and risk everything just to advance your scenario and show that nobody else can oppose you? Don't you know that old saying? You can build_ _a throne of bayonets__, but you can't sit on it for long."_  
"你是说种族灭绝，六分仪！你愿意摧毁整个日本，冒一切风险，只为推进你的计划，展示无人能反对你？你难道不知道那句老话吗？你可以用刺刀堆砌王座，但你无法长久坐稳它。"

_"It's not of your concern anymore, Commander. Your authority on this operation has been overruled because of your confirmed act of treason. My men and I are assuming full control of the operation now."  
"这已不再是你该关心的事了，司令。由于你确凿的叛国行为，你在此次行动中的权威已被否决。我和我的部下现在将全面接管行动。"_

_"Pilot Sohryu!" –_ the man said through the radio, apparently unaware that I've heard all of the previous conversations "_Be ready for combat. Your mission is to neutralize the target and destroy its core. Support transport ships will be assigned to make sure that you will manage to get within the shore with a few minutes of battery remaining. Once they get in position, disconnect your power cable and prepare to engage. I'm sure that you will not fail."_  
“Sohryu 机师！”——那人通过无线电说道，显然不知道我已听到了之前的所有对话，“准备战斗。你的任务是中和目标并摧毁其核心。支援运输船将被指派，确保你在电池剩余几分钟时能抵达岸边。一旦它们就位，断开电源电缆，准备投入战斗。我相信你不会失败。”

I was worried about Amelie and everyone else on board.  
我担心着 Amelie 和船上的每一个人。

I should have said no. I should have stopped this madman.  
我本该拒绝的。我本该阻止这个疯子。

But I couldn't do it.  
但我做不到。

"Roger, sir. All systems prepared. Waiting for the signal."  
"罗杰，长官。所有系统准备就绪。等待信号。"

---

No other communication was heard from the base since the last order, so I guess that Holly and the others were taken away from the operation too.  
自上次命令后，基地再无任何通讯传来，我猜霍莉和其他人也被撤离了行动。

I had no idea about what was going on in the control tower anymore, but I tried to not think too much about that and focus all of my remaining strength in the upcoming battle.  
我对控制塔里发生的一切已毫无头绪，但我尽量不去多想，而是将所有剩余的力量集中在即将到来的战斗上。

Finally, the moment that I had been waiting for so long has arrived. I was going to a real battle with my Eva. 303 days after the first time that I've piloted this monster. I've waited long enough.  
终于，我期盼已久的时刻来临了。我将驾驶我的 Eva 投入真正的战斗。自首次操纵这台巨兽以来，已经过去了 303 天。我等待得够久了。

I should have been happy and excited, right? But strangely, I wasn't. Not even the imminent battle was able to draw an emotion from me. I was becoming what I feared the most. A doll, unable to feel emotions and whose only purpose in life is to wait for orders.  
我本该感到高兴和兴奋，对吧？但奇怪的是，我并没有。甚至连迫在眉睫的战斗也无法激起我的情感。我正在变成我最害怕的样子——一个玩偶，无法感受情感，生命的唯一目的就是等待命令。

'No, it's worse than that. A doll is not capable of hurting people, like I am. The only thing I had left was Eva. As it had always been. There is no other destiny for me but to pilot and win. But I will do it for myself. Not for anybody else.'  
“不，比那更糟。玩偶无法像我这样伤害人。我仅剩的只有伊娃，一如既往。我的命运除了驾驶并取胜别无他选。但我会为自己而战，不是为了任何人。”

As soon as I got the signal, I shut down all of my communication systems.  
一收到信号，我立刻关闭了所有通信系统。

The last thing I could want at that moment was to hear someone interrupting this moment.  
那一刻我最不希望的就是有人打断这个时刻。

I knew exactly what to do. I was going to fight. I was going to win. And everything would be all right.  
我清楚地知道该怎么做。我要战斗。我要赢。一切都会好起来的。

I looked at the series of transport boats that were positioned towards the shore.  
我看着一排排停靠在岸边的运输船。

They were placed there so that I could use them as supports to move my Eva without making contact to water, since I wasn't using B-Type equipment.  
它们被放置在那里，以便我可以利用它们作为支撑，让我的 Eva 移动而不接触水面，因为我没有使用 B 型装备。

With this deployment, I could get to the shore quickly, without the risk of damaging the Eva.  
借助这次部署，我可以迅速抵达海岸，同时避免使 Eva 受损的风险。

I would face this unknown enemy, and I would only have five minutes to complete the mission.  
我将面对这个未知的敌人，而我只有五分钟的时间来完成任务。

It was showtime. My chance.  
是时候了。我的机会。

In one swift movement, I disconnected the Eva from the power cable and started my way to shore.  
我迅速切断了 Eva 的电源线，朝着岸边进发。

With a precise series of coordinated movements, as if I were a professional gymnast, I managed to perform the series of jumps necessary to approach the shore in record time, using less than a minute of battery power.  
我像专业体操运动员一样，通过一系列精确协调的动作，成功完成了快速接近岸边所需的连续跳跃，仅用了不到一分钟的电池电量，创下了记录。

While I assumed battle position immediately, I looked at my opponent.  
我立即进入战斗姿态，同时注视着对手。

The huge robot was slowly veering left to try to mobilize its weapon to face me, as if it was in doubt where to go or if it wasn't able to moving forward somehow.  
那巨大的机器人缓缓向左偏转，试图调动其武器来面对我，仿佛它在犹豫该往何处去，或是某种程度上无法前进。

"Too slow. I'm not going to wait until you come to me, fool. Here I go!"  
太慢了。我不会等你来找我，傻瓜。我来了！

In a swift movement, I managed to jump and hit the stupid robot with both feet on his chest.  
我迅速一跃，成功地用双脚猛击那愚蠢机器人的胸膛。

Even though the robot was much bigger and heavier than Eva, the force of the impact brought it to the ground, and made it roll a few times until it absorbed all the impact.  
尽管机器人比伊娃大得多也重得多，但冲击力还是让它倒地，并翻滚了几圈，直到完全吸收了冲击力。

"Come on.. where are you?"  
“快点...你在哪儿？”

I quickly approached the robot and could see that it was still active, but practically unresponsive.  
我迅速靠近机器人，发现它虽然仍在运行，但几乎毫无反应。

"Hey… You can't be done already. Fight back! I waited to long for this fight! At least have the decency to be a respectable foe."  
"嘿…你不可能这么快就完了。反击啊！我等这场战斗等得太久了！至少要有成为可敬对手的体面。"

The robot made a feeble attempt to get up, that made me angry and propelled me to deliver a hard kick on its head.  
机器人无力地试图站起来，这让我更加愤怒，促使我狠狠地踢向它的头部。

"No, no! No easy way out for you! You have to do better than that!"  
"不，不！对你来说没有轻松的出路！你得做得更好才行！"

The robot started to roll over to the side, trying to get away from me. This was starting to get ridiculous.  
机器人开始向旁边滚动，试图逃离我。这开始变得荒谬起来。

"Where do you think you're going? You cannot run so far away, you fool! Be a man and try to fight me!"  
“你以为你能去哪儿？你跑不了多远的，傻瓜！像个男人一样，试着跟我打一场！”

'What is he doing? Why he is not fighting me? He has just resigned to die? How dare he deny me the honor of a decent fight after all this time?'  
“他在做什么？为什么不跟我打？他就这么认命等死吗？他怎么敢在这么长时间后拒绝给我一场体面的战斗？”

What a disgusting feeling. I could feel the rage building up inside me. An irrational kind of anger. 'How could this guy can even call himself a pilot? He is a fool, moron, stupid, dork, idiot, imbecile, simpleton…'  
多么令人作呕的感觉。我能感觉到怒火在我心中积聚。一种非理性的愤怒。‘这家伙怎么敢自称是飞行员？他是个傻瓜，白痴，蠢货，呆子，笨蛋，低能儿，蠢人……’

No, this was not right.  
不，这不对劲。

'He is all of that, yet none those words or all other insults in the German language are appropriated words to describe him… he is… he is a…'  
‘他确实有这些特质，但没有一个词或德语中所有的侮辱性词汇能恰当地形容他……他是个……他是个……’

"BAKA!" "笨蛋！"

I shouted this strange word with all of my strength as a rush of memories passed through my head.  
我竭尽全力喊出这个奇怪的词，一连串记忆涌入脑海。

A shy boy was wearing my red plug suit. FLASH.  
一个害羞的男孩穿着我的红色插头服。闪回。

The same wimpy boy was now wearing black pants and a white shirt, like a school uniform. FLASH.  
那个同样懦弱的男孩现在穿着黑色裤子和白色衬衫，像是校服一样。闪光。

Now he was wearing a ridiculous outfit, and trying to… dance? FLASH.  
现在他穿着一身滑稽的服装，还试图……跳舞？闪光。

Blue pants and a red shirt? That suits this beautiful boy, better, I guess. FLASH.  
蓝色裤子和红色衬衫？这对这个英俊的男孩来说，或许更合适些。闪光。

Despite of the fact that he is trembling, he has quite an imposing presence in his blue and white plug suit. It makes me feel… safe? FLASH.  
尽管他颤抖着，但那蓝白相间的插入栓服却赋予了他一种令人敬畏的气场。这让我感到……安心？闪光。

'I cannot see his face. Who is this…'  
“我看不清他的脸。这个人是谁……”

_Hey... Wake up! Come on... Wake up! Call me baka. like usual!  
嘿...醒醒！快点...醒过来！像往常一样叫我笨蛋！_

It was only the alert of the batteries reaching critical level that brought me back to reality. The robot took that opportunity to finally get up and stand on its feet again.  
正是电池达到临界水平的警报声将我拉回了现实。机器人趁此机会终于站了起来，重新稳稳地立在脚上。

"Ha… I guess that we will have just 60 seconds for us, isn't it? So that's all I have to take your heart away? No problem. That's more than enough for me."  
“哈…我想我们只有 60 秒的时间了，对吧？那么，这就是我要夺走你心脏的全部时间？没问题。对我来说绰绰有余。”

Using the full power of my Evangelion, I jumped at the robot like a missile, hitting it directly in the chest with my shoulder. This movement threw the robot off balance, causing it to fall again.  
我全力驱动我的福音战士，如同一枚导弹般跃向机器人，用肩膀直击其胸膛。这一击让机器人失去平衡，再次摔倒在地。

I took the opportunity to get on top of it, immobilizing its movements with my Eva's legs and my right arm, leaving my left arm ready to hit the bizarre pulsating core protruding from the top of the robot.  
我趁机爬到它上面，用 Eva 的双腿和右臂将其固定住，使其无法动弹，同时左臂蓄势待发，准备打击从机器人顶部伸出的奇怪跳动核心。

I was feeling it again. A good sensation. The thrill of the battle. And with it, I could also feel an uncomfortable the desire to punish and hurt this enemy.  
我又感受到了。一种美好的感觉。战斗的刺激。与此同时，我也感受到了一种不舒服的欲望，想要惩罚并伤害这个敌人。

"DIE!" I shouted as I delivered a strong punch onto its core. I could see that it made a huge damage on the odd organic structure. One more blow and it would be finished for good.  
“去死吧！”我大喊着，一拳重重地打在它的核心上。我能看到这一击对那奇怪的有机结构造成了巨大破坏。再来一击，它就彻底完蛋了。

But to my surprise, my second punch missed its target. In a quick and unexpected move, the robot managed to hold the blow with the palm of its hand, applying enough force to crush my Evangelion's fingers.  
但出乎我意料的是，我的第二拳并未击中目标。机器人以迅雷不及掩耳之势，用掌心接住了这一击，施加的力量足以碾碎我驾驶的 EVA 的手指。

While I knew that those were only fake fingers, real bruises were the outcome of the maneuver. I had forgotten how it hurt. The pain that I felt because of the high synchronization rate with the Evangelion. It made me feel… alive? _I don't want to die.  
尽管我知道那些只是假手指，但这一动作确实造成了真实的瘀伤。我忘记了那种疼痛的感觉。由于与 EVA 的高同步率，我感受到了疼痛。这让我感到……活着？我不想死。  
_  
These thoughts, however, were soon forgotten when I realized that the robot pilot had taken advantage of the moment of distraction to reverse our positions.  
然而，这些念头很快就被我抛诸脑后，因为我意识到机器人驾驶员已经趁我分神之际，逆转了我们的位置。

He now had the upper hand, managing to position himself above my Eva, immobilizing me and holding my neck with both hands. The sensation of oxygen deprivation came on strongly. A strangely familiar pain. _I don't want to die_. He was trying to kill me. _I don't want to die_. I felt my consciousness slipping away as I heard the sound informing me that the battery timer had reached zero. _I... don't... want to... DIE!_  
他现在占了上风，成功地将自己置于我的 Eva 之上，将我制住并用双手扼住我的脖子。缺氧的感觉强烈袭来。一种奇怪而熟悉的痛楚。我不想死。他正试图杀了我。我不想死。随着电池计时器归零的提示声响起，我感觉自己的意识正在消散。我...不想...死...

I felt a sense of anger come over me, stronger than before, as I noticed that the right arm of my Evangelion began to move towards the robot's face.  
我感到一股比之前更强烈的愤怒涌上心头，因为我注意到我的 Eva 的右臂开始向机器人的脸部移动。

_I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!  
我要杀了你！我要杀了你！我要杀了你！_

To my surprise, the pressure on my neck was suddenly relieved. The robot seemed to be inert. The feeling of anger gave way to a feeling of confusion, relief and... sadness?  
令我意外的是，颈部的压力突然减轻了。机器人似乎陷入了静止。愤怒的情绪被困惑、解脱和……悲伤所取代？

As soon as my hand came close to the robot's face, all these feelings came together at once.  
当我的手靠近机器人的脸时，所有这些情感瞬间汇聚在一起。

After a moment of hesitation, with a single swift movement I managed to pull out the organic mass containing my opponent's core and its input plug, and place it directly on my chest, near to my Eva's core.  
犹豫片刻后，我迅速一挥手，成功拔出了包含对手核心及其输入插头的有机物质，并将其直接放在我胸前，靠近我的 Eva 核心处。

And my last memory was the feeling of tears falling over my face.  
而我最后的记忆，是泪水滑过脸颊的感觉。

### Chapter 4 If I can't be yours

I opened my eyes and realized that I wasn't on the train anymore.  
我睁开眼睛，意识到自己已经不在火车上了。

There was no sign of the stupid Shinji either.  
愚蠢的 Shinji 也不见踪影。

Looking around, I realized that I was in a dark place, looking like a theater room, with only a lone chair near the stage.  
环顾四周，我意识到自己身处一个昏暗的地方，看起来像是个剧院房间，舞台附近只有一把孤零零的椅子。

On the stage was a video projection screen. There was no other sound, no sign of life, and apparently no door or window.  
舞台上有一块视频投影屏幕。没有其他声音，没有生命的迹象，显然也没有门或窗。

I must have been freaking out, but for some reason I slowly approached the chair and sat down.  
我一定是吓坏了，但不知为何，我缓缓地走向那把椅子，坐了下来。

To my amazement, as soon as I decided to sit down on the chair, I heard a small pop as a video started to be projected on the screen.  
令我惊奇的是，我刚决定坐在椅子上，就听到一声轻微的“啪”，随即屏幕上开始投影出一段视频。

The movie screen showed a video of myself. I was inside of an entry plug.  
电影屏幕上播放的是我自己的视频。我正坐在驾驶舱内。

The Asuka on the screen was focused, concentrating on filling her lungs with LCL. I could hear her breathing and other sounds.  
屏幕上的明日香专注而集中，正努力用 LCL 填充她的肺部。我能听到她的呼吸声和其他声音。

After a few seconds, some oddly familiar voices started to come from the radio system of the Evangelion.  
几秒钟后，一些奇怪而熟悉的嗓音开始从 EVA 的无线电系统中传出。

_"Mankind is really amazing. I still can't believe that we've managed to assemble the remaining pieces of the destroyed Unit 02 and build another artificial S2 engine."  
“人类真是不可思议。我仍然难以置信，我们居然设法组装了被摧毁的 02 号机残骸，并建造了另一台人造 S2 引擎。”_

_"A change is coming, Jason. To activate this S2 engine that is imbued in this imperfect Evangelion is a possibility of rebirth. In fact, the survival and renaissance of the human civilization depends of that project".  
"变革即将到来，杰森。激活这个嵌入在这不完美福音战士中的 S2 引擎，是重生的可能。事实上，人类文明的生存与复兴依赖于这个项目。"_

_"I know, Commander, but it's still very impressive. To do all that in just at couple of months after the estimated date of the Third impact is kinda of a miracle."  
"我明白，指挥官，但这依然令人印象深刻。在第三次冲击预估日期后的短短几个月内完成这一切，可以说是奇迹了。"_

_"Well son, the creative principle doesn't come from nothing. We should be thankful that we were able to retrieve most of the old research data in our MAGI backbone. Especially the researches made about 20 years ago. Herz always has been a place of higher learning, one of the first great references in terms of development of works related to Evangelion. In special, project Eva-R. It was the prime work about the nature of the angels and the motivator of the Katsuragi's expedition before their… annihilation. And also, as much as I don't like it, we got to give credit to that man that managed to gather the remaining's of Unit 02 from Japan in the middle of the chaos, since that the adamnite tissue of the Mass Production Series are useless and unable to regenerate because their cores are dead."  
"嗯，儿子，创造的原则并非凭空而来。我们应该庆幸能够从我们的 MAGI 核心中恢复大部分旧研究数据，特别是 20 年前的研究。赫兹一直是一个高等学府，是关于福音战士相关作品发展的首批重要参考之一。特别是 Eva-R 项目。它是关于天使本质的主要研究，也是葛城探险队出发前的动力源泉……在他们被……消灭之前。而且，尽管我不喜欢，我们还得感谢那个人，他在混乱中从日本收集了 02 机体的残余，因为量产系列的亚当组织已经无用且无法再生，因为它们的核已经死亡。"_

_"Avil is correct. I'm sorry for the delay."  
"Avil 说得没错。对于延误，我深感抱歉。"_

_"It's about time, Ik… I mean, Rokobungi. Everything is ready for activation. But there are some important things that aren't clear yet. You will try to use the Amarantos Anima protocol in this test. We are aware that kind of contact experience was already tested with Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu The goal was to make a permanent connection with the pilot and the Eva but, as you know, it was a failure. It was was discontinued since we developed other… more efficient ways of making a pilot synchronize with the Evangelion. You say that the MAGI and the annotations from the Dark Kabbalah retrieved from Hertz will made it work this time. How can you be so sure about that?"  
"终于等到这一刻了，Ik……我是说，Rokobungi。一切激活准备就绪，但仍有一些关键问题尚未明朗。这次测试中，你打算尝试使用 Amarantos Anima 协议。我们清楚，这种接触体验之前已在 Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu 身上进行过试验，目的是建立驾驶员与 Eva 之间的永久连接，但你也知道，那次尝试以失败告终，之后便因我们开发了其他更为高效的方法来实现驾驶员与 Eva 的同步而中止。你声称，这次有了从 Hertz 处获取的 MAGI 系统及《黑暗卡巴拉》的注释，就能确保成功。你凭什么如此确信？"_

_"It's a legitimate question, Avil. The procedure will make a direct link between the subject's mind and the core of the Evangelion. After an initial perturbation, the intense feelings of love and hate imbued in a person's soul would be transferred to the core of the Evangelion. Like the love that a mother has for her child. Or the hate that a person has towards a former unfaithful lover. The key challenge will try to assure that the pilot won't go insane and will be minimally functional to do the job, unlike happened to Ms. Sohryu. Therefore, we will only extract the memories and feelings that are more prominent in the subject's mind until it's enough to make the Evangelion activate."  
"这是一个合理的问题，Avil。该程序将在受试者的心灵与 EVA 的核心之间建立直接联系。经过初始的扰动后，一个人灵魂中深藏的爱与恨的强烈情感将被转移到 EVA 的核心中。就像母亲对孩子的爱，或是人对背叛的前恋人的恨。关键挑战在于确保驾驶员不会因此发疯，并能保持最低限度的功能以完成任务，不像惣流小姐那样。因此，我们将只提取受试者心中最显著的记忆和情感，直到足以激活 EVA。"_

_"That's a very good explanation. But save it for the politics. Everybody in this room knew that the Evangelion needs a functional soul to be activated. So, the procedure will not mess only with her mind, but also with her soul, right?"  
"解释得很到位。但政治上的事就留到政治场合去说吧。在座的各位都知道，EVA 需要一个功能正常的灵魂才能激活。所以，这个程序不仅会扰乱她的心智，还会影响她的灵魂，对吧？"_

_"The substance that forms the soul is directly attached to one's minds and inner feelings So, pieces of the subject soul will be extracted from the subject into the core to ensure that the Evangelion would be provided with a functional soul that is 100% compatible with the pilot."  
"构成灵魂的物质直接与人的心智和内在情感相连。因此，将从主体灵魂中提取部分融入核心，以确保使徒能拥有一个与驾驶员 100%兼容的功能性灵魂。"_

_"What? You mean… you're gonna split her… soul?"  
"什么？你是说…你要分裂她的…灵魂？"_

_" What has been broken, cannot be unbroken. Just like one can't rebuild a glass of wine that has shattered, the reconstruction of the soul is still an impossible task by our current knowledge."  
"破碎之物，无法复原。就像无法重塑已碎的酒杯，根据我们目前的知识，灵魂的重构仍是一项不可能的任务。"_

_"That's crazy. She is just a teenager! Heck, even with all of this madness outside, she can't do it! I won't allow you to…"  
"这太疯狂了。她只是个十几岁的孩子！见鬼，即使外面这么混乱，她也不可能做到！我不会让你……"_

"Amelie!" – I heard the Asuka on the screen talking through the radio with a firm, but also tender voice – "It's ok. I'm not a child. I will do it. I can do it. It's just like you said, humanity depends of that project".  
"Amelie！" – 我听到屏幕上的明日香通过无线电坚定而温柔地说道 – "没事的。我不是小孩子了。我会去做的。我能做到。就像你说的，人类的命运就取决于这个项目。"

_"Asuka… but… you understand that..."  
"明日香……但是……你明白这意味着什么吗……"_

"Come on. You have been watching me doing synchronization tests since I was a child. This is not the first and certainly won't be the last test that I will manage to succeed. Let's do it! Or I won't forgive you. Over and out"  
"来吧。你从小看着我做同步测试。这不会是我第一次成功，当然也不会是最后一次。我们开始吧！否则我可不原谅你。完毕。"

_A big flash on the screen blinded my eyes.  
屏幕上的一道强光刺痛了我的眼睛。_

_*flash* *闪光*_

---

"Hate… hate… I hate everything. I hate myself. But what I hate the most is…"  
"恨……恨……我恨一切。我恨我自己。但我最恨的是……"

"Asuka! Asuka, what's happening?" – said a familiar voice.  
"明日香！明日香，发生了什么？" – 一个熟悉的声音说道。"

The Asuka on the screen was somehow back in Misato's apartment and was staring at Shinji Ikari, dressed in his salmon-colored shirt. The same outfit that he was wearing in that night and… during instrumentality. And just looking at this scene made me feel sick.  
屏幕上的明日香不知怎么回到了美里小姐的公寓，正盯着穿着那件三文鱼色衬衫的碇真嗣。那晚他穿的就是这套衣服，还有……在人类补完计划期间。光是看到这一幕就让我感到恶心。

"They are going to erase you from my mind. I will forget everything about you! And by doing that, I will be able to pilot Eva again."  
"他们要从我的记忆中抹去你。我会忘记关于你的一切！而这样做，我就能再次驾驶 Eva 了。"

"But why me?" "但为什么是我？"

"Because you're a giant asshole! Is that enough?"  
"因为你是个超级混蛋！这样够了吗？"

She snapped at him as he back down.  
她厉声斥责他，当他退缩时。

"I can't stand to even look at you. Your pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile. That sort of wounded puppy shit you do. Is it so much to ask for an actual man to be with?"  
“我连看你一眼都受不了。你那可怜兮兮、软弱无力的道歉笑容，那种受伤小狗般的把戏。难道要求一个真正的男人相伴过分吗？”

She started to scream at him, taken by some kind of irrational rage.  
她开始对他尖叫，被某种无名的愤怒所驱使。

"Now the only fuel that manages me to keep it going is to know how pathetic you are. You are so needy. The way you look at me, like I should be ashamed of myself for trying to do something with my life that doesn't revolve around you. I mean, I've got to have it somewhere, right?  
"现在唯一支撑我继续下去的动力，就是知道你有多可悲。你如此依赖。你看着我的眼神，好像我应该为自己试图过一种不围绕你的生活而感到羞愧。我是说，我总得有个地方去，对吧？"

She picked up a chair and threw it with anger at the floor, while the scared boy took several steps backwards.  
她愤怒地抓起一把椅子，猛地扔向地板，而那个受惊的男孩则连连后退了几步。

"I remember the time I made you come out and kiss me. You were terrified. Like a goddamn girl. I really don't know why I have put any expectations in you. I mean, shouldn't the good times at least outnumber the shit times? But it's not even close! How can I even look at you?"  
"我记得那次我让你出来吻我。你吓坏了。像个该死的女孩。我真的不知道为什么会对你有任何期待。我是说，至少美好的时光应该多于糟糕的时刻吧？但事实远非如此！我怎么还能面对你？"

Shinji clenched his hand and, for once, looked at her with a look that mirrored her rage.  
真嗣紧握拳头，这一次，他用一种与她怒火相映的眼神看着她。

"That's unfair, Asuka! You don't tell me things. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me."  
“这不公平，明日香！你从不告诉我事情。我是个透明人。我什么都告诉你。所有那些该死的尴尬事。你不信任我。”

"You don't have to be afraid of silence, dumb-ass! Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating. But you only pay attention to my looks and never tried to understand me."  
“你不必害怕沉默，傻瓜！不停地说话并不一定就是在交流。但你只关注我的外表，从未试图理解我。”

"I don't do that. I want to know you. I don't constantly talk. In fact, I suck at it. But people have to share things. That's what intimacy is. I'm really pissed that you said that to me. I'm tired. If you are ok with erasing me, so be it. I give up. Enjoy your life, oh supreme Eva pilot."  
"我不做那种事。我想了解你。我不常说话。事实上，我在这方面很糟糕。但人们必须分享事情。这就是亲密的意义。你那样对我说，我真的生气了。我累了。如果你觉得可以抹去我，那就这样吧。我放弃了。享受你的生活吧，哦，至高无上的 Eva 驾驶员。"

"_Fick dich,_ Shinji! Look at it out here. It's falling apart. All returning to nothing. I'm erasing you! I will never even remember your damn face! And I'm happy about it ok?"  
"去你的，真嗣！看看外面。一切都分崩离析。一切都在回归虚无。我要抹去你！我永远不会记得你那该死的脸！而且我对此感到高兴，好吗？"

Shinji turned away and moved inside his room, slamming the door shut.  
真嗣转身走进自己的房间，砰的一声把门关上。

"_Dummkopf_! After this you'll be gone! You hear me? You'll be gone! A perfect ending to this piece of _scheiß_ story! I will forget it all, until there's not even a reminder that I… hated you!  
"笨蛋！这一切之后你就会消失！你听到了吗？你会消失！这个烂故事的完美结局！我会忘记这一切，直到连一点提醒我……恨你的痕迹都不剩！

*flash *闪现

The scenario changed again.  
场景再次变换。

The Asuka on the screen gazed out over the ocean, her arms hugging her knees. Shinji was at her side, a few steps behind, also looking at the ocean.  
屏幕上的明日香凝视着大海，双臂环抱着膝盖。真嗣在她身旁，稍稍落后几步，同样望着海洋。

I remembered that moment.  
我记得那一刻。

It was the time when I decided to twist the knife.  
那是我决定转动刀刃的时刻。

I used to think that love and hate are opposites. But that is not true. Instrumentality showed me that and even if I hate it, I couldn't lie to myself that I loved and hated Shinji Ikari with all of my heart. A really disgusting feeling. However, there was a solution for that.  
我曾以为爱与恨是相对的。但事实并非如此。人类补完计划让我明白了这一点，即便我憎恨它，我也无法对自己撒谎，说我全心全意地爱着并恨着碇真嗣。一种极其令人作呕的感觉。然而，对此有一个解决办法。

I knew it would hurt us both, but it was what it needed to be done. It was like amputating a body part that is in a state of necrosis. As much as no one likes the idea of losing an essential part of their body and having to live with the after-effects for the rest of their life. It's like a cancer. Sometimes you have to destroy the root cause before it spreads out of control and manages to destroy everything.  
我知道这会让我们双方都痛苦，但这是必须要做的。就像切除一个已经坏死的身体部位。尽管没有人愿意失去身体的重要部分，并不得不在余生中承受其后果。这就像癌症。有时你必须在它失控并摧毁一切之前，摧毁根源。

And this was the best I could do. For myself and for the idiot too. The sooner the better.  
这是我所能做的最好的选择。为了我自己，也为了那个傻瓜。越快越好。

"Hey. Just one more thing before we go."  
"嘿，在我们走之前还有一件事。"

"What is it, Asuka?" "什么事，明日香？"

"Listen to me, third. No matter what you've seem or felt during that time… what we had…. it's was just something they call propinquity effect or an exposure effect…. some kind of attraction or imprinting, or even an addiction… but it was not love or anything remotely close to that."  
"听着，第三适格者。无论你在那段时间里看到了什么，感受到了什么……我们之间的……那只是所谓的邻近效应或暴露效应……某种吸引或印记，甚至是上瘾……但那不是爱，或者任何接近爱的东西。"

"Asuka… what do you mean?"  
"明日香…你这是什么意思？"

The girl took a deep breath and turned her neck to look at the boy, with a look of pain, frustration and…doubt?  
女孩深吸了一口气，转过头来看着男孩，脸上带着痛苦、沮丧和…怀疑？

"I will put it in simpler terms to you. Whatever you think you saw inside our minds… it was not love. It was just a coping mechanism created by two scared children that longed for any kind of affection. This is not love. It's co-dependency. It's toxic. Everybody can see it. We should let go of those twisted feelings."  
"我会用更简单的词来解释给你听。无论你认为你在我们心中看到了什么…那不是爱。那只是两个渴望任何形式关爱、害怕的孩子创造的一种应对机制。这不是爱。这是共依存。这是有毒的。每个人都能看出来。我们应该放下那些扭曲的感情。"

"I… understand." "我……明白。"

"Heck, I've even knew from the start that that this kind of thing would happen. It was so obvious. That's why boys and girls shouldn't live under the same roof after the age of seven… I should have put more resistance from the start and spared us of this disgusting outcome."  
"见鬼，我甚至从一开始就知道这种事会发生。太明显了。这就是为什么男孩和女孩在七岁以后不应该住在同一个屋檐下……我一开始就应该更加抗拒，避免这种令人作呕的结果。"

Shinji stared at the ocean, in silence.  
真嗣静静地凝视着大海。

"I hope I've made myself clear. So, you'd better not misunderstand things. Until we know what happen to the rest of the world, for all effects, we are still on the battlefield and need each other… to survive. Nothing more."  
"我希望我已经表达清楚了。所以，你最好不要误解。在我们了解世界其他地方发生了什么之前，从各个方面来看，我们仍处于战场，需要彼此……才能生存。仅此而已。"

"Ok."

Why he was so freakish calm about that? Looking at it from that perspective, he seems… empty?  
为什么他对这件事如此异常冷静？从这个角度看，他似乎……空洞？

"And another thing, just to be sure that you've understand everything and that I can at least trust you in this new battlefield until the situation changes. No matter what happens, under no circumstances you're allowed to touch me. Even if I'm dying, I forbid you to ever touching me, EVER, again. If you do it, I will kill you. Do you understand?"  
"还有一件事，只是为了确保你理解了一切，至少在这新战场上我能信任你，直到情况改变。无论发生什么，在任何情况下你都不允许碰我。即使我濒临死亡，我也禁止你再次触碰我，永远。如果你这么做，我会杀了你。明白了吗？"

He turned away from her and stared to the other side.  
他转过身去，不再看她，目光投向了另一边。

"Yes. I will be ready to move when you are."  
“是的，你准备好了，我就随时可以出发。”

Great. It was easy. We had a deal. We would work together for a little longer and that would be our last dance.  
太好了，这很简单。我们达成了协议，再合作一段时间，那将是我们的最后一舞。

*flash *闪回

---

Asuka and Shinji were sitting down, inside of a what looked like a shelter, looking at each other.  
明日香和真嗣坐在一个看似避难所的地方，彼此对视着。

It was late night. How much time has passed by since that first day on the beach? Weeks, months? I don't know. Every day were the same routine. Wake up, find food, do nothing, eat, poop and try to sleep. But that night was one of the rare ones in which we were having a serious conversation.  
已是深夜。自那海滩上的第一天起，时间过去了多久？几周，几个月？我不知道。每一天都是同样的例行公事。醒来，寻找食物，无所事事，进食，排泄，然后尝试入睡。但那一晚是难得的一次，我们进行了一场严肃的对话。

And I was angry at him. With good reason. Shinji has been keeping secrets from me. About instrumentality. About what he did. And what he could have done. About Wondergirl and the last angel roles in everything that happened.  
我对他感到愤怒，这是有充分理由的。真嗣一直在对我隐瞒秘密。关于人类补完计划，关于他所做的事情，以及他本可以做的事情。关于明日香和最后一个使徒在这一切中所扮演的角色。

I've demanded some explanations. And he was trying hard to choose his words carefully. He truly was hiding something. Something deep. And important.  
我要求他给出一些解释。而他努力斟酌着用词。他确实在隐藏着什么，深层的，重要的东西。

"After our... conversation at the train... and on the apartment... I've… snapped at you. That started third impact and instrumentality began."  
在我们...在火车上的那次...以及在公寓里的对话之后...我...对你发了脾气。那引发了第三次冲击，人类补完计划开始了。

"Don't need to explain it to me things that I already know, idiot. Just get straight to the point."  
"不需要向我解释我已经知道的事情，白痴。直接说重点。"

"L-like I said before, during instrumentality I was able to visualize several alternative realities in which things could have been different. In those realities... in many of them we lived a normal life, as normal children, teenagers or adults, as if the Evangelions had never existed."  
"就像我之前说的，在融合过程中，我能够想象出几个不同的现实，在那里事情可能会有所不同。在那些现实中...在很多情况下，我们过着正常的生活，作为正常的孩子、青少年或成年人，仿佛 EVA 从未存在过。"

"Sometimes the world was already like that from the beginning. Other times it stayed that way because I... didn't fail... at least not as much. In those worlds I was able to avoid the 3rd impact or, even if I wasn't, I was able to fix everything and get the world back to a much better state than it was before."  
"有时候世界从一开始就是那样的。其他时候它保持那样是因为我...没有失败...至少没有那么多次。在那些世界里，我能够避免第三次冲击，或者即使我没能做到，我也能够修复一切，让世界恢复到一个比之前好得多的状态。"

"So, the greatest hero Shinji saved us again in his dream worlds. Hooray! Like he always do. Except, you know, in this reality. The only one that matters. "  
"所以，最伟大的英雄真嗣又在梦境世界中拯救了我们。万岁！就像他一贯做的那样。不过，你知道，在这个现实里。唯一重要的那个。"

"Please Asuka…you're the one who asked for this, remember? I'm just telling you but if you don't want to hear, that is fine.  
"请原谅，明日香……是你要求我这么做的，记得吗？我只是告诉你，但如果你不想听，那也没关系。"

"So, about Rei... and Kaworu…"  
"那么，关于绫波...还有薰…"

Of course. Wondergirl and that last angel, as expected. Right. They were perfect servants to provide the all mighty Shinji Ikari with everything he needs. However, my counterpart on the screen maintained her composure.  
当然。意料之中，Wondergirl 和那个最后的使徒。没错。她们是完美的仆人，为至高无上的碇真嗣提供他所需要的一切。然而，屏幕上的我的对手保持着镇定。

"In those other realities Rei and Kaworu were... well, they weren't clones or angels... and I was able to relate more openly to them as well. In all those scenarios, being around them was…. good. Their presence just made me… happy I guess."  
在那些其他现实中，丽和薰……嗯，他们不是克隆人或使徒……我也能够更开放地与他们建立联系。在所有那些情景中，与他们在一起是……好的。他们的存在只是让我……感到快乐吧。

"I see. Well, this conversation is over. I don't want to hear about your pervert fantasies. I feel sick."  
我明白了。好吧，这次对话结束了。我不想听你的变态幻想。我觉得恶心。

"Wait. Even though their presence managed to make me feel better, in all those worlds I... I always had a sense of emptiness. Of dissatisfaction. That it wasn't real. And that... even if it was... it wouldn't be right."  
"等等。尽管他们的存在让我感觉好些了，但在所有那些世界里，我……我总是有一种空虚感。一种不满。觉得那不是真的。而且……即使它是真的……那也不对。"

"Guess you really hated yourself huh? That's why you ran away from instrumentality. Yet I bet you didn't care about that when it came time to live out your romantic fantasies, did you?"  
"看来你真的很讨厌自己啊？这就是你逃离一体化的原因。不过我打赌，当你沉浸在浪漫幻想中时，你并不在乎这些，对吧？"

"No. We wouldn't be having this conversation if things were that simple."  
"不。如果事情那么简单，我们就不会有这场对话了。"

"You're just a delusional pervert. So, what did you do about it? Wondergirl and the homo-angel weren't good enough for you? You went after Misato to do the rest with her? Or you've just created a perfect doll who would fall from the sky off a para-shoot to satisfy all your fantasies."  
"你不过是个妄想狂变态。那么，你做了什么？奇迹少女和那个同性天使对你来说还不够吗？你去找了 Misato 来完成剩下的部分？还是你创造了一个完美的玩偶，她会从天而降，用降落伞满足你所有的幻想？"

"..."

"What's with that face and... oh, come on! You really did it, didn't you? I bet you created a harem for yourself. Disgusting. You really are incapable of thinking of others except to fulfill your disgusting fantasies."  
"你那是什么表情……哦，得了吧！你真的做了，对吧？我打赌你为自己建了个后宫。真恶心。你真的除了满足你那恶心的幻想之外，根本不会考虑别人。"

"Yes." "是的。"

"What?" "什么？"

"In several of these alternate worlds, there was a person who I think it could have helped me to be happy. She was a girl with long hair and glasses… or did she have a short red hair? I can't really remember. She was shy…. or flirty? I think her name was Ma…"  
"在这些平行世界中，有一个人我觉得可能让我感到幸福。她是一个长发戴眼镜的女孩……还是短发红发？我记不清了。她很害羞……还是轻浮？我想她的名字是 Ma……"

The Asuka on the screen looked at him as I felt a familiar feeling rising. One that I've vowed to suppress.  
屏幕上的明日香看着他，我感到一种熟悉的情绪在升起。那是我曾发誓要压制的。

"That just shows what a mediocre screenwriter you are. Thinking that some hot girl is going to fell on a parachute over you and guide you to a life of eternal happiness? That's pathetic."  
“那只能说明你是个平庸的编剧。以为某个火辣的女孩会乘着降落伞掉在你头上，然后引导你走向永恒的幸福生活？真是可悲。”

"..."

"Third? Are you there? Is something wrong?"  
“第三？你在吗？有什么不对劲吗？”

"N-nothing, just remembering a few more things"  
"没、没什么，只是又想起了一些事情"

"Like what?" "比如什么？"

"Look, the point is. I couldn't be really happy in any of those was…something that were always on my mind that won't allow me to be at peace."  
"听着，关键是。我在那些地方都无法真正快乐……总有些事情萦绕心头，让我无法安宁。"

"Great. Even if you could shape the world and reality the way you wanted to, you couldn't be happy? That is pathetic, even for you.  
"真糟糕。即使你能随心所欲地塑造世界和现实，你也无法快乐？这对你来说也太可悲了。"

"Cut it off, ok? I'm done. It's late. I won't talk about this anymore."  
"剪掉吧，好吗？我受够了。太晚了。我不会再谈这个了。"

"Oh, why I'm surprised. Run away again, like the coward that you are."  
"哦，我为什么还感到惊讶。再次逃跑吧，就像你这个懦夫一样。"

"Stop it!" "住口！"

"So finish what you've started, damn it! What was missing? Why you couldn't just settle down there and create fucking better world?"  
"那就完成你开始的事，该死的！少了什么？为什么你不能就在那里安定下来，创造一个更好的世界？"

"Because you were there!"  
"因为你就在那里！"

The Asuka on the screen looked at him as I felt a familiar feeling rising in her. One that I've vowed to suppress. Shinji also sensed that.  
屏幕上的明日香看着他，我感觉到她心中升起了一种熟悉的感觉。一种我曾发誓要压制的情感。真嗣也察觉到了这一点。

"I… I mean… Asuka… It's not like that I mean..."  
"我…我是说…明日香…不是那样的我意思是..."

A hard slap went right into his face. And then she left. Running. Without looking back.  
一个重重的耳光狠狠地打在他的脸上。然后她离开了。跑着。没有回头。

I thought that it would be just another night. I didn't know at the time that it would be the last time that I would ever see his face.  
我以为那只是又一个普通的夜晚。当时我并不知道，那将是我最后一次见到他的脸。

*flash *闪回

---

The Asuka on the screen was in a small room. No. I remember now. It was a cell. A luxury prison. But not the first one. She had a piece of paper in her hand and started banging on the wall next to the bed in a rhythmic way.  
屏幕上的明日香身处一间小屋。不，我现在记起来了，那是牢房，一间豪华的监狱，但不是第一个。她手里拿着一张纸，开始有节奏地敲打床边的墙壁。

"Hey… who it is?" – that voice. Yes, it was that day. Several months after the last time that I've spoken to him, there he was. In a cell that was adjacent to mine. Just like it was promised.  
“嘿……是谁？”——那个声音。没错，就是那一天。距离我上次与他交谈几个月后，他就在那里。在一个与我相邻的牢房里。正如所承诺的那样。

"Hello Third. Long time no see." – Ironically, neither I or the Asuka on the screen were able to actually see his dumb and shocked face.  
"你好，Third。好久不见。" – 讽刺的是，无论是我还是屏幕上的 Asuka，都无法真正看到他那愚蠢又震惊的脸。

For once I was thankful that those Japanese had no sense of privacy, so, even on a cell that looks like a luxury prison, two people could still talk normally, despite being separated by a solid wall.  
难得我感激日本人毫无隐私观念，即便是在看似豪华监狱的牢房里，两个人隔着一堵实墙也能正常交谈。

"A-asuka? But how…. I mean… are you ok? Did they hurt…"  
"Asuka？但怎么……我是说……你还好吗？他们伤害你了吗……"

"Dear Asuka" – she started to read out loud the letter that was on her hand – "I hope that you are safe and well. I don't know if this letter will ever reach you, but if you're reading it right now, I want you to know that I… would like to finish our last conversation. There are some things that you deserve to know. So, if you can, please try to write me back, ok? Sincerely yours, Shinji."  
“亲爱的明日香”——她开始大声朗读手中的信——“我希望你平安无事。我不知道这封信是否能到达你手中，但如果你现在正在读它，我想让你知道，我……希望能完成我们上次的对话。有些事情你应当知晓。所以，如果你可以的话，请试着给我回信，好吗？你真挚的，真嗣。”

Total silence. The boy on the other side of the wall said nothing, so she continued.  
一片寂静。墙那边的男孩没有说话，于是她继续道。

"Well, I'm not good at reading kanji, but I think I got it right. So, here I am, third."  
“嗯，我不太擅长读汉字，但我想我理解对了。所以，我是第三个。”

"Asuka… you read my letter?  
"明日香……你读了我的信？"

"And exactly what else I would do with it, idiot? Origami? Make a thousand cranes and ask for a wish for a new world?"  
"不然我还能拿它做什么，白痴？折纸吗？折一千只纸鹤，许愿一个新世界？"

"No… sorry. Dumb question."  
"不……抱歉。蠢问题。"

"So, tell me how you got the guts to write this letter?"  
"那么，告诉我你是怎么鼓起勇气写这封信的？"

"Well, after that day… they got me here. I've been kept here in this place for a few months, without being able to go outside, only being allowed to leave when… well, I guess it must have been the same for you right?"  
"嗯，那天之后……他们把我带到了这里。我被关在这个地方好几个月了，不能出去，只有被允许离开的时候……嗯，我想你也是一样的，对吧？"

"Just answer my question."  
"直接回答我的问题。"

Another awkward pause. 又一次尴尬的沉默。

"Ok… There was a day when Ibuki came here to ask me questions. I was happy to see a familiar face, but I've noticed that things are… well, different now. Either way, I asked her about you."  
“好吧……有一天，伊布 ki 来这里问我问题。见到熟悉的面孔我很高兴，但我注意到现在的情况……嗯，有些不同了。无论如何，我问了她关于你的事。”

The Asuka on the screen brought the hand that was holding the letter to her chest as she climber on the bed, putting her ear closer to the wall as the boy continued to talk.  
屏幕上的明日香将拿着信的手放在胸前，爬上床，将耳朵贴近墙壁，男孩继续说着话。

"She didn't say anything out loud, but wrote a note on a paper that said that you were alive and being kept here too. So, I asked her if I could have pen and paper for write some stuff and she managed to get me that. On her next visit, I asked her if she could deliver that letter to you. But it was some weeks ago. I think I was already accepting the fact that this letter wouldn't ever reach.."  
"她没有大声说出来，而是在一张纸上写了个便条，说你还活着，也被关在这里。于是，我向她请求能否给我笔和纸写些东西，她设法帮我弄到了。在她下次来访时，我请她把那封信转交给你。但那已经是几周前的事了。我想我已经接受了这封信可能永远无法送达的事实。"

"I get it. So, let's get straight to the point. There's something that I need to know. You said that I also was in your "dream worlds" … during instrumentality, right?"  
"我明白了。那我们就直奔主题吧。有件事我需要了解。你提到我在你的“梦境世界”中也出现过……是在人类补完计划期间，对吧？"

"Y-yeah… that's right." "嗯……是的，没错。"

"I need you…. To finish what you've started. So, tell me everything about it. That's why I've made the effort to be here."  
"我需要你……完成你已经开始的事情。所以，告诉我关于它的所有细节。这就是我费心来到这里的原因。"

"Asuka, I…" "明日香，我……"

"I will not ask again. I promise you that I will listen everything until the end this time. But if you don't want to tell me about that now, that's it. I'll ask to move back for my old cell and we will never talk or see each other again."  
"我不会再次询问。我向你保证，这次我会一直听到最后。但如果你现在不想告诉我，那就这样吧。我会要求搬回我原来的牢房，我们永远不会再交谈或见面。"

The way that I talked to him seemed right at that time, but it now makes me sick. Another threat, another emotional bargain. Why does it have to be that way? Why does he have to be such a wimp and make me act like a bitch just to be able to start a serious conversation?  
那时我对他讲话的方式似乎没错，但现在让我感到恶心。又一次威胁，又一次情感交易。为何非得这样？为何他得如此懦弱，逼得我像个泼妇一样才能开始一场认真的对话？

"No… Asuka… I… will tell you about it if you want but you…"  
"不…明日香…我…如果你想知道，我会告诉你的，但你…"

"Yes. I will probably don't like it and be mad with you again. But it's not a problem anymore. You've hurt me so many times before that I highly doubt that one small talk will even scratch me."  
"是的。我可能会不喜欢，再次对你生气。但这已经不重要了。你之前已经伤害我那么多次，我高度怀疑一次小小的谈话能对我造成什么影响。"

"S-sorry… Asuka…" "对-对不起… 明日香…"

"You better start now." "你最好现在就开始。"

"Ok… I will." "好的… 我会。"

There was several seconds of silence before he started to talk.  
他沉默了几秒钟后才开始说话。

"As I already told you… I've felt like I've watched several lives in an infinity of possible worlds and universes. In all of those universes, there were 'Asukas' that, in most of those, were just like you."  
正如我之前告诉你的……我感觉自己仿佛在无数可能的世界和宇宙中见证了多段人生。在所有那些宇宙中，都有'明日香'，而在大多数情况下，她们都和你一样。

I felt myself starting to become angry at the thought.  
想到这里，我感到自己开始生气了。

"I knew that they weren't really you. But …they also were you in some ways. They always managed to have your pride, attitude and beau.. appearance."  
"我知道他们并不是真正的你。但……在某些方面，他们也是你。他们总是能展现出你的骄傲、态度和……外貌。"

_"I'm Asuka Langley Sohryu charmed, huh? Anta-baka? Chance! Please look at me!" 'No! That's not me!' –_ a damn flashback of the day that the Angel invaded my mind and I almost couldn't hear the sequel.  
"我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，被迷住了吗？笨蛋！机会！请看着我！'不！那不是我！'——那天使侵入我心灵的日子，我几乎听不清后续的可怕回忆。"

"In all those universes I saw... the only universes in which I could really feel at ease... were in the ones where our parents were alive and we...were childhood friends and you would wake me up every morning so we could go to school together like normal kids."  
"在我所见过的所有宇宙中……唯一让我真正感到自在的……是那些父母健在，我们……是青梅竹马的宇宙，你每天早上叫醒我，我们一起像普通孩子一样去上学。"

The Asuka on the screen laughed hard, interrupting him. "Well... that's so corny and lame. Me? Of all people? I guess there were really nobody else for you in those worlds."  
屏幕上的明日香大笑不止，打断了他。“好吧……真是老套又无聊。我？偏偏是我？看来那些世界里真的没有其他人适合你了。”

"No. I've already told you that. Everybody was there somehow. Misato, Rei, Toji, Kensuke, Hilkari… even Kaworu appeared latter. Those where… good places. Worlds where nobody dies. Worlds without Evangelions. After seeing that, I thought I could learn to love myself and that would be ok to accept instrumentality. I could even see and hear everybody cheering and giving me congratulations at the moment."  
“不，我已经告诉过你了。每个人都在那里，以某种方式。美里、丽、冬二、真希、日和里……甚至后来还出现了渚薰。那些是……美好的地方。没有死亡的世界。没有 EVA 的世界。看到这些后，我以为我可以学会爱自己，接受人类补完计划也没关系。我甚至能看到并听到大家在那一刻为我欢呼和祝贺。”

"Hmph." "哼。"

"But eventually… after seeing how life was at those worlds and my interactions with all those people… I noticed that, in all those times… even if Rei, Kaworu and other girls were present… I would eventually fall in love with you, Asuka… or, at least, with those versions of you. And I was really happy to see that those Asukas also loved me back".  
“但最终……在看到那些世界的生活以及与所有人的互动之后……我注意到，在所有那些时刻……即使丽、渚薰和其他女孩在场……我最终还是会爱上你，明日香……或者，至少是那些版本的你。看到那些明日香也爱着我，我真的很高兴。”

"Yeah, right. You may dream dreams come true, pervert." - Yeah. Gott knows that I've had my share of those kinds of foolish dreams too….  
"“是啊，没错。你或许梦想成真，变态。”——是啊。上帝知道我也曾有过不少那样的愚蠢梦想……”

"I know that those were false realities, Asuka, you don't need to mock me for that. However, at that time, for a moment, I've felt something like truly happiness and had feelings that it would be the perfect epilogue for this story. A happy end for all that, after this crappy life."  
“我知道那些都是虚假的现实，明日香，你不必为此嘲笑我。然而，在那一刻，我确实感受到了真正的幸福，觉得那会是这个故事的完美结局。在经历了如此糟糕的人生之后，一切都能迎来一个幸福的结局。”

"But after dreaming about those worlds for a while, I've realized that, somehow, the Evangelions had already started to appear again in those perfects worlds. And them… it all went tumbling down."  
“但梦见那些世界一段时间后，我意识到，不知为何，那些完美的世界里，福音战士们又开始出现了。而它们……一切又都崩塌了。”

"What happened?" “发生了什么？”

"We become pilots again, having to face some angel-like enemies, I think. We won. Together. But… since the Evangelions are machines of war they decided to… separate us. We still loved each other and tried hard to be together, but they would eventually send you back to Germany, since that kind of military power could not be concentrated in only one country."  
"我们再次成为驾驶员，不得不面对一些天使般的敌人，我想。我们赢了。一起。但……由于 EVA 是战争机器，他们决定……把我们分开。我们依然深爱着彼此，并努力想要在一起，但他们最终还是把你送回了德国，因为那种军事力量不能只集中在一个国家。"

"WHAT?" – I saw my counterpart on the screen scream. - "That's…. surprisingly accurate. It makes sense. In fact, they probably have delayed my permission to join you for the fight against the Angels because of politics. People at EuroNerv didn't want to give control of Unit-02 to the Geofront until they were convinced that the Angels were a larger threat than Japan itself."  
"什么？" – 我看到屏幕上的另一个我尖叫道。- "那……出乎意料地准确。说得通。实际上，他们可能因为政治原因推迟了我加入你对抗使徒的许可。欧洲 Nerv 的人不想在确信使徒比日本本身更大的威胁之前，把 2 号机控制权交给 Geofront。"

"So, you know what would eventually have happened then…" – he said with a sad voice.  
"所以，你知道最终会发生什么……" – 他用悲伤的声音说道。"

"We... they would make us fight… against each other. With the Evas…"  
"我们...他们会让我们互相战斗…用 Eva…"

"And if we refused to do that, they would have killed us or something like that."  
"如果我们拒绝这样做，他们就会杀了我们或者类似的事情。"

"Yes… They would." "是的…他们会。"

"Asuka… we both know that the worst feeling in the world is not never being able to be happy, but to have been happy for a moment and then have it stripped from you, right?"  
"明日香…我们都知道，世界上最糟糕的感觉不是永远无法快乐，而是曾经有过片刻的幸福，然后又被夺走，对吧？"

"…"

"So... After I concluded that these scenarios were always going to end up happening as long as the Evas continued to exist, I tried... to take the reins of instrumentality and imagine what could be done on worlds similar to ours, to try to prevent or reverse the third impact and end the Evangelions while it was still possible."  
"所以...在我得出结论，只要 EVA 继续存在，这些情况总会发生之后，我尝试...掌握融入集体意识的主动权，想象在我们类似的世界中可以做些什么，试图阻止或逆转第三次冲击，并在还来得及的时候结束《新世纪福音战士》。"

"That didn't happen in a direct way. With each world I created something got lost. At first it was simple things, like some dates that didn't match. But then things started to change...especially in relation to you."  
"这并非直接发生。在每个我创造的世界中，总有些东西丢失了。起初是一些简单的事情，比如某些日期不匹配。但后来事情开始发生变化...尤其是与你相关的事情。"

"That's the part that you were afraid to tell me on that day, right?"  
"那就是那天你害怕告诉我的部分，对吧？"

"Y-yes. It is." "是-是的。"

"That's okay. I promised that I would listen. A promise made, a promise kept. You can go on."  
"没关系。我承诺过会倾听。许下的承诺，就要遵守。你继续说吧。"

"In the beginning it was simple details and minor alterations. For example, in some universes I met you for the first time already here in Japan and not in Over the Rainbow. Then more details changed. The color of your eyes, the color of your hair... one of the times you told me that you didn't know who your father was, because your mother had decided to get pregnant through a donor."  
"起初，只是一些简单的细节和微小的变化。比如，在某些宇宙中，我第一次遇见你是在日本，而不是在彩虹之上。然后，更多的细节发生了改变。你眼睛的颜色，你头发的颜色……有一次，你告诉我你不知道你的父亲是谁，因为你的母亲决定通过捐赠者怀孕。"

"What? Well... I guess between having an asshole like that as my father and having that option..."  
"什么？嗯……我想，比起有个那样的混蛋父亲，这个选项……"

"No, Asuka... that's not the point. The point is that… in each new world I visited I felt like... I was distancing myself from you, making you into a different person than you are. I was scared. I started trying to create worlds in which I would stay further away from you. So that I wouldn't hurt you anymore. Like you asked me to do that time."  
"不，明日香……这不是重点。重点是……在每一个我造访的新世界里，我感觉……我正在远离你，把你变成一个不同于你的人。我很害怕。我开始尝试创造一些我与你保持更远距离的世界。这样我就不会再伤害你了。就像那次你要求我做的那样。"

"Bullshit. That's just a sophisticated way to say that you were wanting to run away again."  
"胡说。那不过是种高级的说辞，意思是你又想逃避罢了。"

"No, it's different. Even in those worlds, no matter how hard I tried to change things, events almost always repeated themselves. And even when I would arrive in time to help you against the mass Productions Evas... the third impact would eventually happen and we would end up... losing our memories or have to face other enemies even worse than the Angels."  
"不，这次不同。即便在那些世界里，无论我多么努力试图改变，事件几乎总是重演。即使我能及时赶到帮你对抗量产型 EVA...第三次冲击最终还是会发生，我们最终...要么失去记忆，要么面对比使徒更可怕的敌人。"

Worse than the Angels? It's kinda funny to think about what kind of enemy could be worse than them. Godzilla? A gargantuan sized huge alien Evangelion?  
比使徒还糟？想想什么样的敌人能比他们更可怕，还真有点好笑。哥斯拉？还是巨型外星 EVA？

"Then I began to understand what was wrong. To fix the world I... had to give up everything and everyone I knew... and also give up of the idea of being together with you. It was as if this was a curse of Eva: to save the world, I couldn't stay in that world with the people who mattered to me. I would only cause more suffering for them. So, I...I... I've opted to remove myself from the worlds I've created, even if I tried to… reach you."  
然后我开始明白问题所在。为了修复这个世界，我……不得不放弃我所知道的一切和所有人……以及与你在一起的想法。这仿佛是 Eva 的诅咒：为了拯救世界，我无法与我在乎的人共存于那个世界。我只会给他们带来更多痛苦。所以，我……我……我选择了从我创造的世界中抽身，即便我曾试图……接近你。

I don't know for sure if I had that thought at that time or if I got that thought as I was watching the scene, but after hearing he say those words something has clicked inside my head.  
我不确定当时是否就有这个念头，还是在我观看这一幕时才产生的，但听到他说出那些话后，我的脑海中仿佛有什么被触动了。

_'Asuka. I'm… not here'._ That was definitely him. Even with a strange voice. Those were his words. The words that really made me notice that there was something wrong with all those dreams. The words that made me start my journey into coming back to this real world.  
'明日香。我……不在这里'。那确实是他。尽管声音很奇怪。那些话是他的。正是这些话让我意识到那些梦境有问题。这些话促使我踏上回归现实世界的旅程。

"But after analyzing all of the options and scenarios… I realized that… even if I tried to be together with you, the ghosts of Evangelion would eventually come back to hurt us and drive us apart. And if I tried to do the opposite and eliminate all of Evangelions… then I…."  
"但在分析了所有选项和情景之后……我意识到……即使我试图与你在一起，《新世纪福音战士》的幽灵最终还是会回来伤害我们，让我们分离。而如果我试图做相反的事，消除所有《新世纪福音战士》的影响……那么我……"

He struggled to pronounce the words, until my counterpart at the screen shouted at him.  
他艰难地吐出这些字眼，直到屏幕上的另一个我对他大喊。

"You what? Speak louder, idiot."  
"你什么？说大声点，白痴。"

"I would not be able to be with you!" – he replied with a shout and, after a while, resumed talking with a scared voice – "B-because neither the existence of Evangelions and neither we being together were things that I could achieve in my mind."  
"我无法与你在一起！" – 他大声回应，片刻后，用颤抖的声音继续说道 – "因为在我心中，既无法接受使徒的存在，也无法想象我们能在一起。"

"You…. will have to explain this better."  
"你……得解释得更清楚些。"

"I could see that… in the worlds where I was not present you've kinda…had moved on with your life and did well… you were able to live a common life without Evangelion and without my presence or even my existence as shadow that would have been a constant source of pain to you. Then I realized that… that it was the best that I could do for you."  
"我能看到……在我不在的那些世界里，你似乎……已经继续你的生活并过得很好……你能够过上没有使徒、没有我陪伴甚至没有我存在的普通生活，那对我来说就像是一个永远的阴影，不断给你带来痛苦。然后我意识到……那是我能为你做的最好的事。"

I don't care about what I thought at that time or at the flabbergasted expression on my counterpart face at the screen. Now I'm completely angry and want to punch him so badly.  
我不在乎当时自己是怎么想的，也不在乎屏幕上那家伙目瞪口呆的表情。现在我完全怒了，真想狠狠揍他一顿。

That's utterly bullshit, Ikari! Yes, I had mixed feelings about you _'had?'_ but, if things were different, I still wanted you to be alive and well and for us to… try to sort things out between us, for better or worse.  
这简直是胡说八道，碇！没错，我对你确实有过复杂的感情，但如果情况不同，我还是希望你能活着，健健康康的，我们……试着解决我们之间的问题，无论结果如何。

Before I met you, I thought that if I had a relationship to a man who would appreciate me for my body, acknowledge my greatness and also… patted me in the head for what I really am… I would be happy. Kaji represented those expectations, but it was just a childish crush.  
遇见你之前，我以为如果我能和一个欣赏我身体、认可我伟大之处，并且……还会因为我真实的样子轻拍我头的人建立关系，我会很幸福。加持代表了这些期望，但那只是一场幼稚的迷恋。

And yes… I can see that I could find one of those things that I wanted by settling up with any stooge, if given enough time. But what I fell _' felt?'_ for you is different from that. Why? Why I nee.. expect so much from you? What am I… if I can't be… '_yours?'_  
是的……我明白，只要有足够的时间，我可以与任何傀儡妥协来得到我想要的东西。但对你，我感受到的‘感觉’却截然不同。为什么？为什么我……对你期望如此之高？如果我不能成为……‘你的’，那我算什么？

"So, in one of the last worlds that I saw in instrumentality... I think that I tried to deconstruct everything that connected us... everything that brought us together in some way...to try to disengage us for good."  
所以，在我所经历的最后一个融合世界中……我想我试图解构所有将我们联系在一起的东西……所有以某种方式让我们走到一起的因素……试图彻底让我们分离。

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"Well... the Asuka of that universe was still the pilot of Evangelion Unit 02 and your appearance and personality were similar, but looking at it now, I can tell that you were quite different. Instead of going to college, that version of you made an early career at the army, becoming a captain. She also didn't even have your mother's last name... and then I found out that that Asuka was artificially created, just like Ayanami."  
嗯……那个宇宙中的明日香仍然是 EVA 二号机的驾驶员，你的外貌和性格相似，但如今看来，你们其实大相径庭。你没有去上大学，而是早早投身军旅，成为了一名上尉。她甚至没有冠以你母亲的姓氏……后来我发现，那个明日香是人工制造的，就像绫波一样。

I was getting really angry at that point. But I knew that myself on the screen would keep her promise and would listen until the end. Even if there was a need to make some snotty remarks.  
那一刻我真的很生气。但我知道屏幕上的自己会遵守她的承诺，会一直听到最后。即使需要说些刻薄的话。

"So, are you saying that you… basically turned me into another doll?"  
“所以，你是说你……基本上把我变成了另一个玩偶？”

I expected that he would back down and say sorry, but his answer really shocked me.  
我以为他会退缩并道歉，但他的回答真的让我震惊。

"Ironically… that was another big difference. She actually liked dolls."  
"讽刺的是…这是另一个巨大的差异。她其实喜欢娃娃。"

That's it. I was almost at my breaking point and would certainly have yelled at him if I wasn't affected by that damn memory of the angel showing me the forms of several alternate Asukas. _That. Is. Not. Me_. It took all of my willpower to return to paying attention to what he was saying.  
就是这样。我几乎到了崩溃的边缘，如果不是被那个该死的天使记忆影响，向我展示了几个不同版本的明日香形态，我肯定会对他大吼。那。不是。我。我费尽全力才回到关注他说话的状态。

"That Asuka defeated the angel that appeared in the ocean without me, so I never got to be inside Unit 2. In that universe we didn't train together to defeat the angel that duplicated itself, as it never appeared. We didn't get to go into that volcano to try to capture the angel that was in the embryonary stage. We didn't... kiss."  
"那个明日香在没有我的情况下击败了出现在海洋中的天使，所以我从未进入过 2 号机。在那个宇宙中，我们没有一起训练来击败那个复制自己的天使，因为它从未出现。我们没有进入那个火山去尝试捕捉处于胚胎阶段的天使。我们没有...接吻。"

Why did he pause before saying that? I bet that this idiot dreamed about kissing any of those Asuka' dolls in his perverted dreams. Well, it's not that I didn't know already and I really don't care about it.  
他为什么在说那句话之前停顿了一下？我敢打赌，这个白痴肯定在变态的梦里幻想过亲吻那些 Asuka 娃娃。好吧，我早就知道这一点，而且我真的不在乎。

"In fact, we had few moments together in Misato's apartment and I think our only positive interactions were the bentos I cooked for her to take for lunch, enduring Toji calling us newlyweds in front of the whole class and… a night in which we shared the same bed and talked for a long time."  
事实上，我们在美里小姐的公寓里共处的时光并不多，我想我们唯一的正面互动就是我为她准备的便当，忍受着全班同学面前真嗣称呼我们为新婚夫妇，还有……一个晚上，我们同床共枕，聊了很久。

I was surprised again. As much as I was hating this story, I could see that that doll...that representation of Asuka...still had something in common with me. And in a way, I felt a little jealous that she had the courage to lay on his bed and… talk to him.  
我又一次感到惊讶。尽管我讨厌这个故事，但我能看出那个娃娃……那个 Asuka 的化身……仍然和我有些共同之处。在某种程度上，我有点嫉妒她有勇气躺在他床上，并且……和他交谈。

"But... I was an even bigger failure in that world. I managed to hurt her in a way even worse than I hurt you. She was selected to test unit 03 instead of Toji. And my father activated the dummy system, just like last time and then... well, you know what happened. She survived, but she was contaminated by the angel, which started to live permanently inside her head somehow."  
"但在那个世界，我失败得更彻底。我以一种比伤害你更甚的方式伤害了她。她被选中测试 03 号机，而不是东治。而我父亲再次启动了傀儡系统，然后……嗯，你知道发生了什么。她幸存了下来，但被使徒污染了，使徒不知怎地永久寄居在她的脑海中。"

Of course, his guilty about what he has done to me would come back haunt him in those dream worlds. Or maybe he really has some sick desire about hurting me, even in his dreams. Still… this scenario is really screwed up and maybe even worse than…  
当然，他对我所做之事的内疚会在那些梦境世界中再次困扰他。或者他真的有某种病态的欲望，即使在梦中也想伤害我。尽管如此……这个情景真是乱七八糟，可能比……

"Oh, and in case that wasn't enough, I was absorbed again into Unit 01's core when I faced Zeruel. I almost caused third impact by doing that, for some reason. And, as the result, I become trapped inside the Eva...only this time for 14 years instead of 30 days."  
"哦，如果这还不够，我在面对零尔时再次被吸收进 01 号机的核心。出于某种原因，我差点因此引发了第三次冲击。结果，我被困在了 Eva 里……只是这次是 14 年，而不是 30 天。"

The Asuka on the screen was in shock, and I can understand why. In those 30 days that he was gone, trapped into his Eva, my life turned into hell and… I think I've never recovered from that. And in those months that we were kept apart I considered to…. do the worst… more than a few times. To have to live 14 years without him… it's simply… _what's that feeling down my chest?_  
屏幕上的明日香震惊不已，我能理解原因。在他消失的那 30 天里，被困在 Eva 中，我的生活变成了地狱，而且……我想我从未从那段经历中恢复过来。在我们被迫分离的那些月份里，我曾多次考虑……做出最糟糕的事。要忍受 14 年没有他的生活……这简直是……胸口那种感觉是什么？

"They have somehow managed to contain Unit 01 and send it to the Moon. Eventually, they found a way to rescue me. Or rather, she managed to rescue me. I think that if I hadn't heard her voice calling me over the communicator I wouldn't have returned. But when I came back... everything had changed, except me. In that world, everyone had good reason to hate me. She more than anyone. Heh, no wonder she called me a brat."  
他们不知怎么设法控制了 01 号机并将其送往月球。最终，他们找到了救我的方法。或者更确切地说，是她设法救了我。我想，如果不是她在通讯器里呼唤我，我可能不会回来。但当我回来时……一切都变了，除了我。在这个世界上，每个人都有充分的理由恨我。她比任何人都更甚。呵呵，难怪她叫我小鬼。

I chuckled a little. 'Brat' was a fine nickname for him, given this situation.  
我轻笑了一声。'小鬼'在这情况下倒是个贴切的绰号。

"Because of the angelic contamination, she was trapped forever in the body of a 14-year-old. Unable to sleep or feel the taste of the food. And shortly thereafter she had to stop me from initiating a fourth impact, because my father had manipulated me with the promise that it would make everything go back to normal. In other words, we were set up to fight each other, inside our Evas. Again. Basically, the worst outcome. Everything that I wanted to avoid in other universes happened twice in this one."  
"由于天使的污染，她永远被困在了 14 岁少女的身体里。无法入睡，也无法品尝食物的味道。不久后，她不得不阻止我发动第四次冲击，因为我的父亲用让一切恢复正常为诱饵操纵了我。换言之，我们被设定在 EVA 中再次相互对抗。基本上，这是最糟糕的结果。我在其他宇宙想要避免的一切，在这个宇宙中发生了两次。"

I could notice that he was struggling to speak… and trying hard to keep the tears from flowing. To think that a doll version of me could draw this kind of reaction from him…  
我能注意到他在努力说话……并且拼命忍住不让泪水流下。没想到我这个玩偶版的自己能让他产生这样的反应……

"After the battle I felt like… human garbage. Useless… a burden. Even worse than the day of the third impact... the real one, from our real world. She had to carry me and take care of me like a baby, even forcing me to eat. And in the meantime, I could see how other people moved on and how I was a freak, an anomaly in that world. But oddly, those people were kinder to me than people in the real world." – he paused for a while, as if he just remembered something important.  
"战斗结束后，我感觉自己就像……人渣。无用……负担。甚至比第三次冲击那天还要糟糕……我们真实世界中的真实事件。她不得不像照顾婴儿一样背着我，照顾我，甚至强迫我进食。与此同时，我看到其他人都在继续前进，而我在这个世界里却像个怪胎，一个异类。但奇怪的是，那些人对我的态度比现实世界中的人要友善得多。" – 他停顿了一会儿，仿佛刚刚想起了什么重要的事情。

"Eventually I had recovered to the point that I was able to pilot Eva again, for the right reasons this time. But again, I only made it to the fight after that Asuka had been defeated and used by my father as a trigger for a new impact because of the contamination of the angel she carried. All that was left for me to do was to pilot Eva again to try to save that world and try to rescue her soul somehow. "And you want to know what happened? Do you really want to know what happened, Asuka?"  
"最终，我恢复到了能够再次驾驶 Eva 的程度，这次是为了正确的理由。但又一次，我只是在 Asuka 被击败并被我父亲用作新冲击的触发器之后才加入战斗，因为她所携带的天使污染。我剩下的唯一任务就是再次驾驶 Eva，试图拯救那个世界，并设法拯救她的灵魂。"你想知道发生了什么吗？Asuka，你真的想知道发生了什么吗？"

His voice was like the voice of a madman at that point.  
那时他的声音听起来就像一个疯子的声音。

"Even with all that shit that happened… before the decisive battle...she told me that she liked me. But she had to leave those feelings in the past, because she had grown up before me. I don't blame her. I hurt her with my inaction and leave her for 14 years. How could she love a brat that simply gave her a fate worse than death because of his weakness?"  
"尽管发生了那么多糟糕的事情……在决战之前……她告诉我她喜欢我。但她不得不把这些感情留在过去，因为她在我之前长大了。我不怪她。我因为我的不作为而伤害了她，让她等了 14 年。她怎么可能爱一个因为自己的软弱而给她带来比死亡更悲惨命运的毛头小子呢？"

I'm getting it now. He wasn't joking when he said that he was trying hard to end all of the things that connected us. He has started with a kind of… species barrier, making that version of me a doll, just like Ayanami… he cut down almost all of the defining moments of our relationship. Also, he created an unforgivable scenario where sorrow and resentment would be even greater than it was with us. And, to top all that, this time skip. That Asuka was, in fact, an adult woman while he was still a brat. A selfish self-centered brat that failed her and probably didn't even like anybody but himself. She… didn't deserve that. But still… if she is an Asuka, she wouldn't give up so easily. Can it be…  
我现在明白了。他不是在开玩笑，他说他正努力结束所有连接我们的东西。他首先打破了某种……物种障碍，让那个我变成了一个像绫波一样的玩偶……他几乎抹去了我们关系中所有重要的时刻。而且，他还创造了一个不可原谅的情景，悲伤和怨恨会比我们之间的更深。更甚的是，这次时间跳跃。那时的明日香实际上是个成年女性，而他还是个孩子。一个自私自利的孩子，辜负了她，可能除了自己谁也不喜欢。她……不该承受这些。但即便如此……如果她是明日香，她不会轻易放弃。难道……

"In the end I... was able again to be the centerpiece of instrumentality again and, because of that, I was able to rescue her soul. So, I had a chance to tell her that I loved her too. Even with all the shit that happened, all the suffering I caused her and even though we had almost nothing in common with each other anymore…. I think that in the end we still managed to fall in love. Again."  
最终我……再次成为了融合计划的核心，正因为如此，我才能拯救她的灵魂。所以，我有机会告诉她我也爱她。尽管发生了那么多糟糕的事，尽管我给她带来了那么多痛苦，尽管我们几乎再也没有什么共同之处……我想，最终我们还是设法相爱了。再次。

He… confessed? To her? It… it makes me_… sick? proud? angry? jealous? happy?_  
他……向她表白了？这……让我感到……恶心？自豪？愤怒？嫉妒？高兴？

"Even so, in the end... we couldn't be together... or even try to be together... because, in order to save that world, I had to sacrifice myself to wipe out all the Evangelions from that world. But, in the end, it all worked out. I told her that I liked her, but showed her a way to move on and live a happy life without me. Also, I could talk to Kaworu and Rei and made them realize that they didn't need me anymore. I did what was the best for everyone. I created a better world where they all could live better lives. A world without Evangelions and… without me. And at the end of it I realized that I didn't die, but was given a chance to live on another world, free to move on and to live a happy life too. It's the best ending that one could imagine, right? Right?"  
即便如此，最终...我们无法在一起...甚至无法尝试在一起...因为，为了拯救那个世界，我不得不牺牲自己来抹除那个世界所有的 EVA。但最终，一切都有了圆满的结局。我向她表白了我的心意，却也指引她走向没有我也能幸福生活的新道路。同时，我能与渚薰和绫波零对话，让他们明白不再需要我。我为每个人做了最好的选择。我创造了一个更好的世界，他们都能过上更美好的生活。一个没有 EVA，也没有我的世界。而在这结局之际，我意识到自己并未死去，而是获得了一个机会，在另一个世界自由前行，同样能过上幸福的生活。这是人们能想象到的最美好的结局，对吧？对吧？

What? Of course not! Where he got this idea from? What kind of people could think that an outcome where he had to sacrifice his happiness and be separated from the persons that he… loved… can be a happy ending? In fact, this is the most freakish bad ending that I could imagine. He used the instrumentality to play God and created a reality where he decided what was better to everyone, treating people like tools or children. Just like…. his father would do. It means that… he… could have done it? He could have turned me into a doll and create a perfect world for him? Then, why…  
什么？当然不是！他这想法是从哪儿冒出来的？什么样的人会认为，他不得不牺牲自己的幸福，与所爱的人分离，这样的结局能算是美满的？实际上，这是我所能想象的最糟糕、最离谱的结局。他利用工具化来扮演上帝，创造了一个由他决定每个人最佳选择的现实，把人们当作工具或孩子对待。就像……他的父亲会做的那样。这意味着……他……可能已经做了？他可能已经把我变成了一个玩偶，为他创造了一个完美的世界？那么，为什么……

"Asuka? Are you still there?"  
“明日香？你还在吗？”

"Third... yes.. I... heard you. Is this… all you have to say?"  
“第三次……是的……我……听到了。你就只有这些要说的吗？”

"In fact… no. As you certainly have figured out already, that wasn't the real ending at all. But I… really need to know what you think about all that before I can go on. It's really important".  
"事实上…不。正如你肯定已经猜到的那样，那根本不是真正的结局。但我…真的需要知道你对这一切的看法，我才能继续下去。这真的很重要。"

The Asuka on the screen thought about the situation for several seconds. Until she decided to talk, with a firm and resolute voice.  
屏幕上的明日香思考了几秒钟。直到她决定用坚定而果断的声音开口。

"Ok. I have just one question. What did she say to you?"  
"好的。我只有一个问题。她对你说了什么？"

"What?" "什么？"

"That Asuka, from this last universe. After you told her that you also liked her. What did she say?"  
"那个来自最后一个宇宙的 Asuka，在你告诉她你也喜欢她之后，她说了什么？"

He didn't respond. For once, I think I got him. I waited for a few minutes until I heard his voice again.  
他没有回应。这一次，我想我猜对了。我等了几分钟，直到再次听到他的声音。

"I… don't know." “我……不知道。”

"You mean you forgot what she said?"  
"你是说你忘了她说了什么？"

"No…. I mean that… I didn't wait to hear her answer."  
“不……我的意思是……我没等到听她的回答。”

I facepalmed, in synchrony with the Asuka on the screen. That's it. I was right. Classic Ikari. Acting like he is so strong, mature, and important telling me those stories and, after all that, he is still disgusting. The Asuka on the screen understood that this was her opportunity to strike back and end this story for good.  
我与屏幕上的明日香同步捂脸。没错，我猜对了。典型的碇真嗣。装得好像自己多么坚强、成熟、重要，对我讲那些故事，结果到头来还是那么令人作呕。屏幕上的明日香明白这是她反击并彻底结束这个故事的绝佳机会。

"Ok...Given all that you've said...I think the lesson here is clear. During the instrumentality, after our conversation in that apartment... I told you that you were only using me as an escape. Because that's the easiest way not to get hurt. You remember that, right?"  
“好吧……鉴于你所说的一切……我想这里的教训很清楚。在融合过程中，我们在那间公寓里的对话之后……我告诉过你，你只是在利用我作为逃避。因为这是避免受伤最简单的方法。你还记得吧？”

"Yes... I do." "是的... 我愿意。"

"So... That's the problem, idiot. That's always been the problem. You still haven't overcome that way of thinking and those selfish desires. That's why in all those worlds you idealized a series of Asukas in your mind who, although they looked strong, deep down were just a stereotypical version of a 'helpless princess'... a person who looks strong and determined, but deep down is just a trophy, whose only goal in life is to be rescued by the all-mighty hero Shinji Ikari. And you cultivated the illusion that, if you did everything right and saved the world, everything would work out and I would eventually fall in love with you and accept you submissively and unconditionally like Wondergirl, Nagisa or another fantasy girl would do in a heartbeat."  
"所以... 这就是问题所在，傻瓜。这始终是问题所在。你仍然没有克服那种思维方式和那些自私的欲望。这就是为什么在所有那些你理想化的世界里，你脑海中有一系列看似坚强的明日香，而内心深处却只是一个刻板的'无助公主'...一个外表坚强果断，内心却只是个奖杯的人，她一生唯一的目标就是被无所不能的英雄碇真嗣拯救。你培养了这样的幻觉，如果你做对了所有事情并拯救了世界，一切都会顺利，我最终会像绫波零、渚薰或其他幻想中的女孩那样，毫不犹豫地无条件接受你并顺从你。"

She took another deep breath as he remained quiet.  
她又深吸了一口气，而他依然沉默不语。

"When you finally understood that this was never going to happen, your subconscious started wanting to get rid of me at all costs and show you that this path would only lead to more suffering. Therefore even though you hated me and wanted to kill me, you still harbored hopes that one day you would be able to turn me into a pathetic doll whose sole purpose in life was being attached to you! Deep down, you just wanted to mold the world and people to the satisfaction of your selfish desires. So, that's why we are here now. Prisoners. Guinea pigs. And we can do nothing but wait until they decide to kill us or do something even worse. "  
"当你终于明白这一切永远不会发生时，你的潜意识开始不惜一切代价想要摆脱我，向你展示这条路只会带来更多的痛苦。因此，尽管你恨我，想要杀了我，但你仍然抱有希望，有一天能将我变成一个可悲的玩偶，其唯一的存在意义就是依附于你！内心深处，你只是想按照自己的自私欲望塑造世界和人们。所以，这就是我们现在成为囚犯、实验品的原因。我们只能等待，直到他们决定杀死我们或做出更糟糕的事情。"

"It's that really how you think, Asuka?"  
"你真的是这么想的吗，明日香？"

"Stop bullshitting me, Ikari. You're unbelievable stupid. After all that… after seeing all that was into my damn mind and heart…. you still think that I'm nothing more than concept. Or that I would complete you or make you alive. But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours. Have you learned nothing at all?"  
"别再胡扯了，碇。你真是不可救药的愚蠢。经历了那么多……看到了我那该死的内心和心灵的一切之后……你仍然认为我只是一个概念。或者我能让你完整，让你活过来。但我只是一个寻求内心平静的混乱女孩。不要把你的期望强加给我。你一点都没学到吗？"

"Well… you're right." "嗯……你说得对。"

His answer once again got me by surprise. And from this point on I knew that the Asuka on the screen couldn't interrupt him anymore and we would just listen to him again, in silence.  
他的回答再次让我感到意外。从这一刻起，我知道屏幕上的明日香再也无法打断他，我们将再次安静地聆听他的话语。

"Instead of embracing this happy ending and moving on like a man would do… I was weak… I've decided to return to this empty, but real, world. Because even if it's painful, I know that I've had good moments and memories, especially from the time that we lived… together. And in doing so, I've also left the door opened for the people that wanted to return. I think that even if this world sucks, it was still a better decision than trying to rewrite the world by my own view and selfish desires."  
"与其拥抱这个幸福的结局并像一个男子汉那样继续前行……我显得软弱……我决定回到这个空虚却真实的世界。因为即便痛苦，我知道自己有过美好的时刻和回忆，尤其是我们一起生活的那段时光。这样做的同时，我也为那些想要回来的人敞开了大门。我认为，即使这个世界不尽如人意，这仍比试图根据自己的观点和自私的欲望重写世界要好。"

That was…impressive. I didn't know that he had it in him…  
那真是……令人印象深刻。我没想到他还有这一面……

"Then I was in despair. Left alone in a devastated world for days. Until that day when I woke up and was able to see you laying by my side. I thought it was a sick joke. That I was still trapped in some hellish fictional world of instrumentality. But, at the same time, the memories of reality and our previous conversations returned, I got angry and, …. Well, you know. Disgusting."  
那时我陷入了绝望。独自一人在一个被毁的世界里度过了好几天。直到那天我醒来，看到你躺在我身边。我以为这是个恶心的玩笑。以为自己仍被困在某个地狱般的集体潜意识世界里。但与此同时，现实和我们的过往对话的记忆也回来了，我感到愤怒，……嗯，你也知道。恶心。

You can bet it was, you idiot.  
你敢打赌是的，你这个白痴。

"But now I understand better. You didn't return because I needed you or you needed me, but only for yourself. Because of your willpower and will to live. You are a different person than me and you will be able to live by yourself. You don't need my help to fix you or something like that. Never did."  
"但现在我更明白了。你回来不是因为我需要你或你需要我，而是为了你自己。因为你自己的意志力和生存欲望。你和我不同，你能够独立生活。你不需要我的帮助来修复你或类似的事情。从未需要过。"

Yes. That's… right? 是的。那……对吗？

"In fact, you also made the right decision when you denied me that time. While you were wrong about my feelings, because at the crucial moment I searched for you and not anybody else, you were right about my selfishness. I wanted you to accept me… to make the pain go away because I was not strong enough to fight against it."  
"事实上，你那时拒绝我也是正确的决定。虽然你误解了我的感情，因为在关键时刻我寻找的是你而不是别人，但你关于我自私的判断是正确的。我希望你接受我……因为我不够坚强，无法独自对抗那份痛苦。"

Well… I guess that he grew up a little…  
嗯……我想他确实成长了一些……

"But I already learned that I don't deserve your help. I never took action myself. I should've tried harder. I should've saved you from that Angel and ignored the orders, just like I did on the volcano. And I even dared to ask you for help just after I have defiled you watched you suffer the worst pain imaginable while I did nothing about it. You were right. I'm disgusting and a worthless scum."  
但我已经明白，我不配得到你的帮助。我从未亲自采取行动。我本该更加努力。我本该从那只天使手中救出你，无视命令，就像我在火山时那样。甚至在玷污你、看着你承受难以想象的痛苦而我却无动于衷之后，我还厚颜无耻地向你求助。你说得对。我令人作呕，是个毫无价值的渣滓。

Why are you telling me those things now? Stupid, idiot, moron! You're late, as always! You don't even realize how much have you h….  
为什么你现在才告诉我这些？笨蛋，傻瓜，白痴！你总是迟到！你甚至不知道你有多……

"After all, I guess I really deserve your hate. I was always a fool to even think that you could have liked me at some point. I don't even deserve to be near you. Because, as you said, all I ever did was hurt you, right?"  
毕竟，我想我真的活该被你恨。我总是个傻瓜，竟然以为你曾经可能喜欢过我。我甚至不配靠近你。因为，正如你所说，我所做的只是伤害你，对吧？

At that moment several images from different memories began to appear on the screen.  
那一刻，来自不同记忆的几个画面开始在屏幕上显现。

The first time I saw him in battle with me, inside my Unit 02. Thinking about it now… what kind of girl takes a boy into her most special place on the first… date? And, while I didn't know it at the time, mama was there all the time too... she allowed his presence…did she... liked him? *flash*  
第一次在战斗中见到他，就在我的二号机里。现在回想起来……什么样的女孩会在第一次……约会时，就把男孩带进自己最特别的地方？而且，虽然当时我不知道，妈妈也一直在那里……她允许他的存在……她……喜欢他吗？*闪回*

When he was in combat, he was completely different from that silly and uninteresting kid. He was a… competent pilot and able to help me in moments when my strength was not enough. I really liked his confident smile *flash*  
战斗中的他，与那个傻乎乎、无趣的孩子截然不同。他是个……能干的飞行员，能在我的力量不足时给予帮助。我真的很喜欢他自信的微笑 *闪回*

That weird feeling on my chest that I got when Misato said we were going to live together. Was it anger, embarrassment or… happiness? *flash*  
当美里说我们要一起生活时，我胸中涌起的那种奇怪感觉。是愤怒、尴尬还是……幸福？*闪回*

How... glad I was when he went after me after Misato and Ayanami humiliated me in that stupid training. He reached for me. He believed in me. *flash*  
当美里和绫波在那次愚蠢的训练中羞辱我后，他追上来找我时，我有多么……高兴。他向我伸出手。他相信我。*闪回*

How much I wanted to be close to him during the night we were alone. For him to be bold and appears at my room, like a knight in a shining armor, toppling the Walls of Jericho *flash*  
在那晚我们独处的时光里，我多么渴望能靠近他。希望他能勇敢地出现在我的房间，就像一位身披闪亮盔甲的骑士，推倒耶利哥城的城墙。*闪回*

How much fun it was to tease him and get his attention during that day at the pool. And seeing him look at me. He really looked at me. *flash*  
在泳池边的那天，逗弄他并吸引他的注意是多么有趣。看着他注视我。他真的在看我。*闪回*

The moment he… saved me. What kind of idiot would jump into a volcano unprotected and defying orders? What kind of person would do that... for me? *flash*  
他救我的那一刻。什么样的傻瓜会不顾命令，不带防护地跳进火山？什么样的人会为了我这么做？*闪回*

I think that wasn't really a moment when I fell in love with him. It was… a sum of everything. How long it has been? Since sometime I can't even remember not having him around makes me feel lonely.  
我想那并不是一个我爱上他的瞬间。那是……一切的总和。已经多久了？自从某个我甚至记不清没有他在身边会让我感到孤独的时刻起。

The idle way we talked while eating breakfast. *flash*.  
我们边吃早餐边闲聊的悠闲方式。*闪回*。

The scent of falling rain as we walked home from school together. *flash*.  
我们一起放学回家时，雨落下的气息。*闪回*。

The quiet moments watching TV or reading manga in each other's' company. *flash*  
在彼此陪伴下静静地看电视或阅读漫画的宁静时刻。*闪回*

The red sunset we casually watched from the veranda *flash*.  
我们不经意间从阳台上眺望的红色夕阳 *闪回*。

The look we exchanged before the kiss. What's that in his eyes? He is... blushing? His eyes are filled with feelings… I guess… love? Fear? Is he afraid of me? Why did…"  
我们接吻前交换的眼神。他眼中是什么？他在...脸红吗？他的眼里充满了情感……我想……是爱？是恐惧？他怕我吗？为什么……

*flash* *闪光*

The Asuka on the screen started screaming. She was inside of the Evangelion again.  
屏幕上的明日香开始尖叫。她再次进入了 EVA 机体内部。

"Amelie! Avil! Jason!". Damn it. "Commander Ikari! Your son of a b… STOP that thing right now, I can't hold it anymore."  
"阿梅丽！阿维尔！杰森！"该死。"碇司令！你这混蛋…立刻停止那东西，我撑不住了。"

But nobody seems to have listened to her plights, because the radio only transmitted static sound.  
但似乎没有人听到她的哀求，因为收音机只传出了静电噪音。

"P-please! Please! I've changed my mind! I want to remember him. And I want him to remember me. Don't… please… don't take him away from me."  
“求求你！求求你！我改变主意了！我想记住他。我也想让他记住我。不要……求你了……不要把他从我身边带走。”

"I don't want to do this! Wake me up! Stop the procedure! Plea –"  
“我不想这么做！叫醒我！停止程序！求——”

*flash *闪光

---

As I opened my eyes, after being blinded by all that flashy sequence, I realized that the Asuka on the screen was back again on Misato's apartment.  
当我睁开眼，从那炫目的闪光中恢复过来时，我意识到屏幕上的明日香又回到了美里小姐的公寓。

Shinji was there, looking at her with sad eyes.  
真嗣也在那里，用悲伤的眼神看着她。

"Shinji… I'm… I'm scared! "I want my mama. I don't want to lose my memories. I don't want to lose y..." – I was interrupted by a gentle caress on my face.  
"真嗣… 我… 我害怕！ "我想妈妈。我不想失去记忆。我不想失去你..." – 我的话被一个温柔的抚摸打断了。

"It's ok, Asuka…I… just want to enjoy my little time left with you. However I.. I have an idea."  
"没事的，明日香…我…只想珍惜和你剩下的短暂时光。不过我…我有个主意。"

"You… do? Well. I sure hope that it doesn't involve something perverted, because..."  
"你…有主意？好吧。我当然希望那不是什么变态的想法，因为..."

"No, it's serious! Listen to me. Suppose you want to keep me from being erased, right? So, if you have memories of me, that's where the Eva will try to look for right? But what if is an indirect memory?"  
"不，这是认真的！听我说。假设你想阻止我被抹除，对吧？那么，如果你有关于我的记忆，那不就是 Eva 会试图寻找的地方吗？但如果这是一种间接记忆呢？"

"It's a valid guess, I assume. I don't know. "  
"这是个合理的猜测，我想。我不清楚。"

"I mean, here. Try this one".  
"我是说，这里。试试这个。"

"This is… after our… kiss? Why did you choose that one?" .  
“这是……在我们……接吻之后？你为什么选那个？”

"Do you remember what you thought about it?"  
"你还记得当时你是怎么想的吗？"

The Asuka on the screen was visibly nervous. I remember that night. I was so dumb. I said things that I didn't mean. I tried to convince myself that I hated it. But…  
屏幕上的明日香明显很紧张。我记得那一晚。我真是太傻了。我说了一些违心的话。我试图说服自己我讨厌它。但是……

"I thought it was a foolish and dumb thing to do. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love."  
"我当时觉得那是一件愚蠢又无聊的事。我以为我把迷恋误当成了爱情。"

That comment should've been enough to end the conversation, but Shinji unexpectedly pushed back.  
那句话本该结束对话，但真嗣却出乎意料地反驳了。

"So what? Infatuation is good, too. There is nothing wrong with that. We were just teenagers having our first kiss For both of us. Of course it would suck, since neither of us knew what we were doing. Things like this need… practice, I guess."  
“那又怎样？迷恋也是美好的。这没什么不对。我们只是青少年，第一次接吻对彼此来说都是。当然会感觉糟糕，因为我们俩都不知道自己在做什么。这种事情需要……练习，我想。”

"Shinji I…." “真嗣，我……”

She realized that there was no escape. There was no way to hold those memories. She had lost. Again. And wouldn't have another chance to talk to him again. So, she snapped and screamed.  
她意识到无路可逃。那些记忆无法挽留。她又输了。而且再也没有机会和他交谈。于是，她崩溃了，尖叫起来。

"God damn it! I wish I had known all about you earlier! My life would've turned out so differently. We would have won! We could have aimed for a brighter future. Even if we wouldn't be together and I had to live a boring life, trapped into a dead-end job, we would be able to advance, somehow. We would have been able to go out and do boring things, like watching the fireworks or just lay down to count the stars in the sky."  
“该死！我真希望早点了解你的一切！我的生活本可以截然不同。我们本可以胜利！我们可以追求一个更光明的未来。即使我们不能在一起，我不得不过着乏味的生活，困在一个毫无前途的工作中，我们也能以某种方式前进。我们本可以出去做些无聊的事，比如看烟花或者只是躺下来数星星。”

He blushed a little, and directed his gaze to the floor as she continued to talk, trying hard not to stutter.  
他微微脸红，目光转向地板，而她继续说着，努力不让自己结巴。

"But I'm glad. Even what we had… even with all that happened…. I'm really glad that I was able to live with you for a while. There were several painful moments but… the good moments that I had with you were basically the only happy moments in my life. _Verdammt, ich wollte nur eine Chance haben, mit dir glücklich zu sein. Um dir zu sagen, dass ich dich liebe_!."  
"但我很高兴。即使是我们所拥有的……即使发生了那么多事……我真的庆幸能和你一起生活一段时间。虽然有些痛苦的时刻，但……和你在一起的美好时光基本上是我生命中唯一的快乐时刻。该死，我只想有一次机会，和你一起幸福。告诉你我爱你！."

"You really mean it, Asuka? You like me?" – Shinji said, with tears forming on his eyes.  
"你是认真的吗，明日香？你喜欢我？" – 真嗣说，眼里泛起了泪光。"

"W-what? You…. since when you can understand German?"  
"什么？你……你什么时候能听懂德语了？"

"Well, I can't… but I'm the Shinji on your mind, remember?"  
"嗯，我不能……但我是你心中的那个真嗣，记得吗？"

She looked at his smiling face, crying tears of joy, and, for once, she let her defenses down. She tackled him into a hug. He stood his ground and held her back, returning the hug.  
她看着他微笑的脸庞，流下了喜悦的泪水，这一次，她放下了防备。她猛地扑向他，紧紧拥抱。他稳稳站立，回以拥抱，同样紧紧地拥抱着她。

If I could… I'd stop time in this world and lock it away for myself, but... if there is any meaning in the fate that pulled us together, maybe…  
如果我能……我会让这个世界的时间停止，为自己封存这一刻，但……如果命运将我们牵引在一起有其意义，或许……

I looked at the screen again and noticed that Shinji's tear-streaked face was already fading. Her eyes were closed and she continued to act as if she was still being held, even though Shinji has begun to disappear.  
我又看了一眼屏幕，发现真嗣那泪痕斑斑的脸庞已经开始消散。她的眼睛紧闭，继续装作仍被抱着的样子，尽管真嗣已经开始消失。

*flash. *闪现。

The scene changed again. 场景再次变换。

This time the Asuka on the screen woke up in a familiar beach. Shinji was there, sitting by her side, in his plugsuit.  
这一次，屏幕上的明日香在一个熟悉的沙滩上醒来。真嗣就在她身边，穿着插入栓服坐着。

"Baka-Shinji?" “笨蛋真嗣？”

"I'm sorry, Asuka. In the end, I will always hurt you because I still can't make any decision. I wasn't able to save you and neither to kill you. Because I'm not capable to take responsibility for my actions and so I do nothing at all."  
“对不起，明日香。到最后，我总是会伤害你，因为我还是无法做出任何决定。我既没能救你，也没能杀你。因为我没有能力为自己的行为负责，所以我什么都没做。”

This Shinji was smiling at her, but I can see that he is trembling. The way that he is hugging his own legs… he is… just like I was that time that I've been put into quarantine after that damn Angel ripped through my mind. The Asuka on the screen, however, wasn't saying anything.  
这个真嗣在对她微笑，但我看得出他在颤抖。他紧紧抱着自己的双腿的样子……他……就像我那次被那个该死的使徒撕裂心灵后被隔离时一样。然而，屏幕上的明日香却一言不发。

"B-but… I'm really glad that we could meet again, even if it's only at the other side of the dream. I just wanted to tell you thanks, for saying that you like me. I also like you, Asuka."  
“但……我真的很高能再次见到你，即使只是在梦的另一边。我只是想告诉你谢谢，谢谢你说你喜欢我。我也喜欢你，明日香。”

She blushed, and just turned her face away from him.  
她脸红了，只是把脸转向了一边。

I understand her. I don't deserve his love. And it would have been better if he didn't tell me those words. Not when I know that I will lose him forever. I want to remember him. And I want him to remember me. It's not fair! It's not fair!  
我理解她。我不配得到他的爱。如果他没有告诉我那些话，或许会更好。尤其在我知道我将永远失去他的时候。我想记住他。也希望他能记住我。这不公平！这不公平！

"Goodbye, Asuka. When you wake up, I think you will recognize your place to belong. A place in which I won't be able to hurt you anymore."  
“再见，明日香。当你醒来时，我想你会找到属于你的地方。一个我再也无法伤害你的地方。”

*flash *闪回

I blinked and realized that Asuka was now inside of an opened entry plug.  
我眨了眨眼，意识到明日香已经进入了打开的插入栓。

I could recognize the place where the entry plug has landed. It was a familiar place, one that I've been in several times in my life. She didn't know why, after all those years that she had managed to be strong, tears started to fall, nonstop.  
我能认出插入栓落地的地点。那是一个我熟悉的地方，一生中曾多次到访。她不明白，在那些年里她一直坚强地挺过来，为何此刻泪水却止不住地滑落。

They kept flowing until she lost consciousness and only darkness remained.  
泪水一直流淌，直到她失去意识，只剩下一片黑暗。

*flash *闪现

Well, there it go, folks. Another chapter.  
好了，各位，又是一章结束了。

Big thanks for deathbringer374 for giving me inspiration for writing almost 10k words in a record pace (and without rum!)  
特别感谢 deathbringer374，为我提供了灵感，让我以创纪录的速度写出了近万字（而且没有喝朗姆酒！）

And, once again, as always, a big thank you to YourBlandestNightmare, tomdj1701 EvaPilotFair, calborghete, poBBpC, SheriffJohnStone, Iraki01 and other guest readers that are following this story.  
再次，一如既往，衷心感谢 YourBlandestNightmare、tomdj1701、EvaPilotFair、calborghete、poBBpC、SheriffJohnStone、Iraki01 以及其他关注此故事的客座读者。

I think that most of the mysteries about the plot are starting to be solved and now we will go towards some more emotional chapters until the conclusion. Hope you are in for the rest of the ride.  
我想关于剧情的大部分谜团开始解开了，接下来我们将进入一些更情感化的章节，直至结局。希望你们准备好继续这段旅程。

### Chapter 5 Everything you've ever dreamed

Well, folks, now that we've saw Asuka's memories, let's continue the ride by placing the final pieces of the puzzle. Enjoy the ride and be prepared for the roller coaster of emotions: waff, comedy and, sadly, more angst.  
好了，各位，既然我们已经见证了明日香的记忆，接下来让我们继续旅程，拼上最后的拼图。准备好迎接情感的过山车吧：甜蜜、喜剧，以及，遗憾的是，更多的苦涩。

I opened my eyes and noticed that both the train and the girl have faded away.  
我睁开眼睛，发现火车和那个女孩都已经消失不见。

I was sitting in a chair, in what seems like an old movie theater, similar to the one that appeared during instrumentality.  
我坐在一张椅子上，身处一个看似老旧的电影院里，与在人类补完计划中出现的那家颇为相似。

I could see myself on the big screen. The Shinji on the screen was sitting inside of an entry plug, talking to Ibuki and Hyuga on the video feed.  
我仿佛能在大屏幕上看到自己。屏幕上的真嗣坐在插入栓内，通过视频通讯与伊吹和日向交谈。

"How are you feeling Shinji?"  
“你感觉怎么样，真嗣？”

"I'm ok. Just do what you need and let's be over with it."  
“我还好。按需要做就行了，让我们尽快结束这一切。”

"Ok, We'll start with his most recent memories and go backwards - more or less. Like the reports said, there is an emotional core to each of our memories."  
“好的，我们从他最近的记忆开始，逐渐往回追溯——大致如此。正如报告所述，我们的每个记忆都有一个情感核心。”

"So, by the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared, feeding the core and making you able to synchronize with the prototype. Good luck Shinji."  
“所以，当你早上醒来时，所有我们设定的记忆都将枯萎消失，滋养核心，让你能够与原型同步。祝你好运，真嗣。”

*flash *闪光

"ASUKA DID WHAT?" “明日香做了什么？”

"I'm sorry, Shinji. She decided to go back to Germany. It seems like some acquaintance or relative of her also returned from the sea and asked for her return. Since you guys are still minors and without a legal guardian…"  
"对不起，真嗣。她决定回德国了。似乎她的某个熟人或亲戚也从海上回来了，要求她回去。既然你们都还是未成年人，又没有法定监护人……"

"That's bullshit and you know it!"  
"这简直是胡说八道，你心里清楚！"

As my eyes adjusted their focus after being blinded by the strong flash, I watched the scene that was unfolding on the screen.  
当我的眼睛在强光照射后重新聚焦时，我注视着屏幕上正在上演的场景。

I could see myself at some kind of examination room, with Hyuga and Ibuki standing near me.  
我可以看到自己在某种检查室里，日向和伊吹站在我旁边。

The scene played just like I remembered it.  
这一幕正如我记忆中的那样上演。

Hyuga stopped what he was talking about when he saw the angry reaction from my counterpart on the screen, who was clenching his right fist in anger. Ibuki stared at him, also in shock and with fear.  
日向看到屏幕上我的对应者愤怒的反应时，停止了谈话，那人正紧握右拳，怒气冲冲。伊吹盯着他，同样震惊且带着恐惧。

"You're lying. Asuka wouldn't return to Germany because of that. It's…. Eva isn't it?" – he said with coldness and venom in his voice.  
"你在撒谎。明日香不会因为那种事回德国的。是……Eva，对吧？" – 他的声音中带着冰冷和怨恨。

Both of the former bridge bunnies of Nerv looked away from him, avoiding his freezing glare.  
两位前 NERV 的通讯操作员都避开了他的目光，不敢直视他那冰冷的瞪视。

"How dare you… After all that happened…. how can you allow someone to try to rebuild Eva? It's unforgivable. Are you guys insane? And you allowed it to happen? Why? ANSWER ME!"  
"你怎么敢……经历了那么多……你怎么能让别人尝试重建 Eva？这是不可饶恕的。你们疯了吗？还允许这种事发生？为什么？回答我！"

Shinji picked a chair and threw it on the nearest window, shattering the glass. Them he picked up a computer and crashed it hard on the table. After he noticed that there were no more objects nearby that could be damaged without hurting the other people in the room, he started to deliver several punches on the wall.  
真嗣挑了一把椅子，猛地砸向最近的窗户，玻璃应声而碎。随后，他抓起一台电脑，重重地摔在桌子上。当他发现周围已没有更多可以破坏的物品而不伤及房间里其他人时，便开始对着墙壁猛击数拳。

Ibuki was ready to call security, but Hyuga made a negative gesture with his head, probably noticing that it was better if the boy was able to let out his frustration as soon as possible, even if he hurt himself in the process.  
伊吹准备呼叫保安，但日向摇了摇头，示意不必，可能他注意到让这男孩尽快发泄出他的愤怒是更好的选择，即便这过程中他会伤害到自己。

After throwing a few punches and even some headbutts on the wall, the Shinji on the screen felt down into his knees, panting and bleeding.  
屏幕上的真嗣对着墙壁挥了几拳，甚至用头撞了几下，最终跪倒在地，喘息着，鲜血直流。

I remembered the feeling. I knew that no one would be there to talk to me or even help me heal my stolen heart and my crackling skull. At that moment, I realized that really had lost everything. I was completely alone. Mother betrayed me. Asuka betrayed me. Eva still existed and its existence would bring even more pain and chaos into this world. Humanity will be trapped forever in the curse of Evangelion.  
我记得那种感觉。我知道没有人会在那里与我交谈，甚至帮助我治愈那颗被盗走的心和那破碎的头骨。那一刻，我意识到我真的失去了一切。我彻底孤独了。母亲背叛了我。明日香也背叛了我。EVA 依然存在，它的存在将给这个世界带来更多的痛苦和混乱。人类将永远被困在 EVA 的诅咒之中。

The Shinji on the screen started to laugh and talk like a madman, with didn't really surprise the other people in the room. And I understood why. At that moment, it had been at least a year since they have locked me up in that cell and only let me leave it for interrogation when they needed me to collect data for something related to the third impact.  
屏幕上的真嗣开始像疯子一样大笑和说话，这并没有真正让房间里的其他人感到惊讶。我理解为什么。那一刻，他们至少已经把我关在那间牢房里一年了，只有在需要我为与第三次冲击相关的事情收集数据进行审讯时，才让我离开。

"You both know that neither Misato or Ritsuko will return, right?"  
“你们俩都知道，无论是美里还是律子都不会回来了，对吧？”

I noticed that Ibuki was on the verge of crying, while Hyuga was doing an impressive job of trying to maintain a poker face. But they weren't able to fool me.  
我注意到伊吹快要哭了，而日向则在努力维持一副扑克脸，但这些都没能骗过我。

"You know what? Fuck it all. Whatever you want me to do, I won't do it. Just kill me already. To the hell with you, to the hell with your project and… to the hell with Asuka!"  
“你知道吗？去他妈的。不管你们要我做什么，我都不会做。干脆杀了我吧。去你的，去你的计划，还有……去你的明日香！”

"She decided to do it, right? And just like that, as soon as the opportunity arrived, she left, without telling me anything. Kaji was right, it's useless. You spend that much time with someone, only to find out she's a stranger. But you know what is the worst part? It's not a surprise at all. That's just like Asuka. Complete selfishness. Complete and utter disregard for anyone else's feelings. She's like a train wreck, tearing people apart leaving chaos and destruction in her wake."  
“她决定这么做，对吧？就这样，一有机会就离开了，什么也没告诉我。加持说得对，这毫无意义。你花了那么多时间与某人相处，结果发现她是个陌生人。但你知道最糟糕的是什么吗？这根本不意外。这就是明日香的风格。完全的自私自利。对别人的感受完全漠视。她就像一场火车事故，撕裂人心，留下一片混乱和破坏。”

*flash *闪光

The Shinji on the screen was somehow back in Misato's apartment and dressed in his salmon-colored shirt, looking at Asuka. She was wearing a yellow shirt and small shorts – the same outfit that she was wearing in that night and during instrumentality -, sitting down on a chair and leaning on the table.  
屏幕上的真嗣不知怎的回到了美里小姐的公寓，穿着他那件鲑鱼色的衬衫，看着明日香。她穿着黄色衬衫和小短裤——正是那晚和融入集体潜意识时所穿的那套，坐在椅子上，身体倚靠在桌边。

"So, I'm a train wreck, third? In the end I was always right, didn't I? You always wanted to kill me!"  
“所以，我是火车事故，第三名？最终我还是对的，不是吗？你总是想杀了我！”

He looked at her, with visible anger in his face.  
他看着她，脸上明显带着怒气。

"I won't be here hearing your mind games and bullshit anymore. It's going, Asuka! All the crap and hurt and disappointment. It's all being wiped away."  
"我不会再在这里听你那些心理游戏和胡说八道了。一切都结束了，明日香！所有的垃圾、伤害和失望，都将被抹去。"

Asuka stood up and looked up at him.  
明日香站起身，抬头看着他。

"Oh yeah? I'm glad." "哦，是吗？那太好了。"

Their eyes lock. She starts to fade as she heard the cold response.  
他们的目光交汇。随着那冷漠的回应传来，她的身影开始逐渐消散。

"Me, too." “我也是。”

She looked at him with an angry but, mostly a disappointed look.  
她带着愤怒，但更多的是失望的神情看着他。

She raised her arm, as she was going to slap on his face but made a quick turn and stormed away towards the bathroom.  
她举起手臂，本要扇他一巴掌，却突然转向，气冲冲地朝浴室走去。

It looked like she was…  
看起来她像是……

*flash *闪光

---

The screen showed two people at the beach.  
屏幕上显示着两个人在海滩上。

A boy was sitting down, trying to wipe out his tears and a girl in a red plugsuit was laying on the sand.  
一个男孩正坐着，试图擦干眼泪，而一个身穿红色插入栓服的女孩躺在沙滩上。

After a few moments, I could see Asuka slowly sitting down, hugging her own legs and looking towards the ocean, only to see again the gigantic face of Rei... or Lilith, who was slowly deteriorating and being consumed by the red ocean.  
片刻之后，我看到明日香缓缓坐下，抱住自己的双腿，望向大海，却再次看到了丽……或是莉莉丝的巨大面孔，她正慢慢腐化，被红色的海洋吞噬。

I remembered that moment. That was it. Like Kaji told me before, the shore was too far and that distance will not be crossed, ever.  
我记得那一刻。就是那样。正如加持之前告诉我的，海岸太遥远了，那距离永远无法跨越。

Asuka didn't say anything, she just kept contemplating the ocean, with her arms around her knees.  
明日香什么也没说，只是继续凝视着大海，双臂环抱着膝盖。

I should have said something at that moment.  
那一刻我本该说些什么的。

But what? Everything we could have said to each other had already been said in instrumentality. Saying something like 'Asuka, I'm glad you're here,' would be practically the same thing as saying 'Asuka, I'm sorry I failed again and made you return to this shitty world. In this hedgehog dilemma, sometimes taking advantage of the silence and the closeness between the two of us would hurt less than using words. But what were the words that Rei and my mother really said to me?  
但说什么呢？我们之间能说的一切在融合中早已说尽。说一句‘明日香，我很高兴你在这里’，几乎等同于说‘明日香，对不起，我又一次失败了，让你回到了这个糟糕的世界’。在这个刺猬困境中，有时利用沉默和彼此间的亲近，比用言语伤害更少。但丽和我母亲究竟对我说了些什么呢？

"Asuka..." "明日香……"

She turned her head to look at the Shinji that was on his feet, standing behind her, daring him to continue to talk. Of course, he stopped right away. She sighed and turned her gaze away to the red sea.  
她转过头，看向站在她身后、已经站起来的真嗣，挑衅地示意他继续说下去。当然，他立刻就闭嘴了。她叹了口气，将目光移向那片红色的海洋。

"If you don't know what to say, don't say anything".  
“如果你不知道该说什么，那就什么都别说。”

"Wha.. no.. it's not… ok… sorry."  
“什…不…不是…好吧…对不起。”

"And don't say sorry." "别再说对不起了。"

"Ok."

After a short pause, he resumed speaking.  
短暂的停顿后，他继续说道。

"It's been days… weeks Asuka. I don't know. Nobody else has returned. I thought I was trapped again… In a personal hell from instrumentality. Cursed to live alone in this world while everybody else is up here."  
"已经过去好几天了……几周了，明日香。我不知道。其他人都没有回来。我以为我又被困住了……在融合中的个人地狱里。注定要独自活在这个世界上，而其他人都在上面。"

He pointed to the ring of souls that formed a red line on the sky.  
他指向天空中形成一道红线的灵魂环。

"Some nights... I dreamed that people would appear again. That the world would return to normal. The dreams seemed like reality. Until I woke up and saw that I was alone holding a ghost-like arm or something. I thought I was trapped again… in a personal hell inside instrumentality. Cursed to live alone in this world while everybody else is up here. Then you just… appeared, as if it was another illusion."  
有些夜晚……我梦见人们会再次出现。世界会恢复正常。那些梦感觉如此真实。直到我醒来，看到自己孤独地握着幽灵般的手臂或其他什么。我以为我又被困住了……在一个工具化内心里的个人地狱。被诅咒独自生活在这个世界上，而其他所有人都在上面。然后你就……出现了，仿佛是另一个幻觉。

"You're really stupid. I didn't just appear there like a damn ghost or something like that. I've emerged on this beach earlier today and was lost for a while. Then I saw your… pathetic memorial thing. You've really though that I would let someone like you kill me? I realized that you should be nearby and them I found you laying here, sleeping."  
你真是蠢。我可不是像鬼魂那样凭空出现的。今天早些时候我就出现在这片海滩上，迷路了一阵子。然后我看到了你那……可悲的纪念物。你真以为我会让你这样的人杀了我？我意识到你应该就在附近，然后就找到了你躺在这里，睡着了。

"Then… why…" "那么…为什么…"

"You were sleeping. I was also exhausted from throwing my anger at that stupid grave that you made for me. So, there was no point waking you up. Heh… it was just another stupid decision to give you the benefit of doubt after all. Not only I lost my chance to finish you off but almost got myself killed for real this time."  
"你当时在睡觉。我也因为对着你为我立的那个愚蠢的墓碑发泄怒火而筋疲力尽。所以，叫醒你毫无意义。呵呵…终究还是个愚蠢的决定，给了你怀疑的余地。不仅失去了干掉你的机会，这次还差点真的把自己搭进去。"

"Asuka… I'm… sor…." "明日香…我…对不…"

"STOP IT! Look… Shinji. Look at me and pay attention. Because I will only say it once. I'm real. And also, all those times in the… futon… in the train… and in the apartment… that was really me. So yes, I saw everything in your sick mind down there because you dared to do just like that damn Angel and get inside my own mind, you freak bastard. And no, I won't forgive you. Never. And don't ever say you're sorry to me again. You got it?"  
"住手！听着……真嗣。看着我，认真听。因为我只说一次。我是真实的。还有，那些在……被褥里……火车上……还有公寓里的那些时刻……那真的是我。所以没错，我看到了你那病态的内心深处，因为你竟敢像那个该死的使徒一样，闯入我的内心，你这个变态混蛋。而且，我不会原谅你。永远不会。也别再对我说对不起。明白了吗？"

He could only nod, slowly.  
他只能缓缓点头。

"Good. But I'm not finished." – she took a deep breath and paused for several seconds before she spoke again. – "Even after all that shit… Yeah, even after you tried to kill me, again… I do not hate you… anymore. And I apologize… not for saying everything I said in that kitchen, I won't take back any of those words.  
"好。但我还没说完。" ——她深吸一口气，停顿了几秒钟才继续说道。—— "即使经历了那些破事……是的，即使你再次试图杀我……我不再恨你了……我也不再恨你了。我道歉……不是因为我厨房里说的那些话，我不会收回任何一个字。

But I guess shouldn't have said all those things to you in that moment. That wasn't an appropriate thing to do in that moment."  
但我想那一刻我不该对你说那些话。在那个时刻，那不是合适的行为。

She again turned her gaze to the ocean. The sound of the waves was the only sound heard for several minutes. Until Asuka decided to break the silence.  
她再次将目光转向大海。海浪的声音是几分钟内唯一能听到的声音。直到明日香决定打破沉默。

"You said it has been days or even weeks that you were there, alone, right?"  
“你说你在那里独自待了几天甚至几周，对吧？”

"Y-yes." “是、是的。”

The girl took another long pause before speaking again.  
女孩再次长时间停顿后才开口。

"So…we don't know for sure how it works, but in the unlikely hypothesis that I was the first one who returned after you and considering that two weeks has passed by that gives us an average exponential rate growth of 5%... in about one year from now, it's possible to estimate that one hundred million people will have returned from the sea."  
“所以……我们并不确定它是如何运作的，但在不太可能的假设下，如果我是你之后第一个回来的，并且考虑到已经过去了两周，这给了我们一个平均 5%的指数增长率……大约从现在起一年后，可能估计会有 1 亿人从海中归来。”

Shinji looked at her, astonished and amazed at the same time.  
真嗣看着她，既惊讶又惊叹。

"Oh… I hope that it's true Asuka."  
"哦……我希望那是真的，明日香。"

She sighed. 她叹了口气。

"You don't understand what that means, right?"  
"你不明白那意味着什么，对吧？"

"No… sor… can you explain it?"  
"不…对不…你能解释一下吗？"

"It means that, besides having to face this shitty world, we can't stay here. If more people come back in this beach in the next few days, it will probably be the same bastards of the JSSDF who were trying to kill us. So... just consider that the war is not over yet. We are still on a mission. We'll stay together until we see how the world will recover and if more people will come back."  
"这意味着，除了要面对这个糟糕的世界，我们也不能留在这里。如果接下来几天有更多人回到这片海滩，很可能是那些试图杀死我们的 JSSDF 混蛋。所以...就当战争还没结束吧。我们仍在执行任务。我们会一起等到看世界如何恢复，以及是否会有更多人回来。"

"You are right. I'm sor… I mean, yes.. we will… find a way to work together… as we always did. Just… take your time. I will be right over there. You're hungry? Thirsty? If you need something, just ask me, ok? I've been thinking…."  
"你说得对。对不…我是说，是的…我们会…找到办法一起合作的…就像我们一直做的那样。只是…慢慢来。我就在那边。你饿了吗？渴了吗？如果需要什么，尽管告诉我，好吗？我一直在想….""

She once again turned her gaze to the ocean, ignoring that useless ranting of a sad boy.  
她再次将目光转向大海，无视那个悲伤男孩的无用咆哮。

*flash *闪光

The scenario changed again, back to the events that took place at the examination room.  
场景再次变换，回到了考场发生的事件。

"Shinji! That's not true, and you know it." – said Ibuki.  
“真嗣！那不是真的，你知道的。”——伊吹说。

"So, stop playing with me! Tell me what happened! And why you guys waited so long to give me that news? I wrote 52 letters to her… letters that you guys that you knew that won't ever reach her….so cut the crap and all those damn lies! If you guys called me now and are telling me she is gone, it's because you need me for something big right? You can suck it up. I won't be helping any of you. I would rather kill myself".  
"够了，别再耍我了！告诉我发生了什么！还有你们为什么等了这么久才告诉我这个消息？我给她写了 52 封信……那些你们明明知道永远不会送到她手里的信……别再扯淡和那些该死的谎言了！如果你们现在打电话给我，告诉我她已经走了，那是因为你们需要我做什么大事对吧？你们可以死心了。我不会帮你们任何人的。我宁愿自我了断。"

"We will take from here. Ibuki, Hyuga, please get out of the room."  
"这里交给我们处理。伊吹，日向，请离开房间。"

Shinji turned his face to see a man and a woman in a military uniform.  
真嗣转过头，看到一男一女穿着军装。

"Who are you?" – he said, still with confidence and venom in his voice.  
"你是谁？" – 他语气中依旧带着自信与狠毒。

"Shinji" – the man said with authority. "Please sit down. You want answers and I assure you that we are gonna give you that."  
"我是真嗣。" – 那人以权威的口吻说道，"请坐。你想要答案，我保证我们会给你。"

"You are from JSSDF aren't you? Your soldiers killed Misato. Tried to kill me before the Third Impact and, after that, have locked me down here for months. Why should I believe in you?"  
"你是来自日本自卫队特种部队的，对吧？你的士兵杀了美里。在第三次冲击前试图杀我，之后又把我关在这里几个月。我凭什么相信你？"

"Hmph… It's like I said, Commander. Gendo Ikari's son is still a baby. We should've assigned Kyo to take care of him, since he used to deal with kindergarten kids." – said the short woman.  
"哼……正如我所说，指挥官。碇源堂的儿子还是个孩子。我们应该让京去照顾他，毕竟他以前处理过幼儿园的小孩。" ——矮个子女人的话。

"Hey, I'm not…" "嘿，我不是……"

"I'm Commander Amai Yadoraki. And this lady here is Sub-Commander Jima. You may not know us, but we have been taking care of you and Asuka since we found you near that shelter."  
"我是指挥官天井亚佐美。这位女士是副指挥官吉马。你可能不认识我们，但我们从在那个避难所附近找到你和明日香开始，就一直照顾着你们。"

"Taking care? Yeah… right."  
"照顾我？是啊……没错。"

"Listen Shinji. Why do you think that you are still alive?" – the woman asked him.  
""听着，真嗣。你为什么认为你还活着？"" – 女人问他。

"I…let me guess. You guys are keeping me as a prisoner to ensure that I won't be murdered? That was I thought, but it isn't true. The only reason that you've kept me and Asuka alive so we could pilot Eva again."  
"我……让我猜猜。你们把我当囚犯是为了确保我不会被杀？我原以为是这样，但事实并非如此。你们留下我和明日香唯一的原因，就是为了让我们再次驾驶 Eva。"

"That's it, enough. Commander, I ask permission to leave the facility won't be doing this anymore. Will get in contact with Yuko, Rot and the others to prepare the Jet Alone in time, but you will have to deal with this young man by yourself."  
"够了，到此为止。指挥官，我请求离开设施，不再参与此事。我会联系优子、罗特和其他人，及时准备杰特·阿诺夫，但您得自己处理这位年轻人了。"

"Permission granted, Sub-Commander. And thanks for caring."  
"准许离开，副指挥官。谢谢你的关心。"

The woman gave a half-smile and exited the room, leaving Shinji alone with the man.  
女子露出一丝苦笑，离开了房间，留下真嗣独自面对那位男子。

"She does care, Shinji. But it's hard for us to get under the fire and pressure all the time. While the reformed Gran, Kuro and other few units of JSSDF are still loyal to us, there are several people of there that just want you and Asuka to be punished and pay for your father sins, Shinji. Heck, if it those people had a little more strength, Asuka would've been killed or sent to Germany from the start and you wouldn't even be able to speak which each other again."  
"她确实在乎，真嗣。但我们总是处于火线和压力之下，这很难。虽然改造后的格兰、黑和 JSSDF 的少数单位仍然忠于我们，但那里有几个人只想让你和明日香为你们父亲的罪行受到惩罚和付出代价。见鬼，如果那些人有再多一点力量，明日香从一开始就会被杀掉或送回德国，你甚至不能再与她交谈。"

The boy sighed and sat on Hyuga's chair.  
男孩叹了口气，坐在日向的椅子上。

"Look, I… am in a bad mood right now, so just tell me…. Where is Asuka? And what the Jet Alone has anything to do with all that?"  
"听着，我……现在心情不好，所以直接告诉我……明日香在哪里？还有 Jet Alone 和这一切有什么关系？"

The man also took a sit and started to talk.  
那人也坐了下来，开始说话。

"I can promise you that I will be honest here, even if it the truth may be unconformable to you, alright?"  
"我可以向你保证，我会在这里说实话，即使真相可能让你感到不适，好吗？"

After receiving a small nod, the man continued.  
在得到轻微的点头后，那人继续说道。

"After our people started to come back from the sea, we realized that some people that had returned earlier were quick to put their hands on valuable resources and military equipment. Notably, equipment that were used to gather the remaining of Evangelion Unit 02."  
自从我们的人从海上归来后，我们意识到一些早先返回的人迅速占据了宝贵的资源和军事装备。特别是那些用于收集剩余的福音战士初号机 02 部件的设备。

The Shinji on the screen was shocked and was apparently trying hard to not vomit with the mention of the former red mecha.  
屏幕上的真嗣震惊不已，显然在努力克制着不因提及那台曾经的红色机甲而呕吐。

"We were informed that those remaining pieces were being transported to Germany, which cause us another problem. In fact, Evangelion Unit 02 was property of Euronerv by the old world's rules, so they had the rights to retrieve it. But still, allowing one country to have that kind of power and the chance to rebuild Eva in this devastated new world would be chaotic.  
我们得知这些剩余部件正被运往德国，这又给我们带来了另一个问题。实际上，按照旧世界的规则，福音战士初号机 02 属于欧洲 NERV，因此他们有权回收。但即便如此，让一个国家在这个满目疮痍的新世界中拥有那种力量并有机会重建 EVA，将会引发混乱。

However, one man managed to convince the new formed UN council that the former pieces of Unit 02 would be necessary to deploy new artificial S2 engines that would be crucial to ensure the rapid recovery of human society before the inevitable collapse that will happen when more people return from the sea. This planet is still pretty much inhospitable right and without means of providing resources to even feed all those people."  
然而，有一个人成功说服了新成立的联合国委员会，认为前 Unit 02 的残骸对于部署新的合成 S2 引擎至关重要，这将确保人类社会在更多人从海洋返回前迅速恢复，否则当更多人归来时，地球将不可避免地面临崩溃。这个星球目前仍然极其不宜居，而且没有手段为所有人提供生存所需的资源。

"It… makes sense I guess but… I don't see what all of this have anything to do with me or Asuka."  
“这……听起来有道理，但……我不明白这与我和明日香有什么关系。”

"The scientists from Euronerv have concluded that a functional S2 engine would need to be attached into a functional Evangelion unit. So they used the remaining of the old Unit 02 to create a new Evangelion. But, as you know, an Evangelion needs a pilot to operate since there are no means to recreate the Dummy System right now."  
“来自欧洲 NERV 的科学家们得出结论，一个功能性的 S2 引擎需要安装在一个功能性的 EVA 单位上。因此，他们利用旧 Unit 02 的剩余部分制造了一台新的 EVA。但正如你所知，EVA 需要一个驾驶员来操作，因为目前无法重建模拟系统。”

Shinji again clenched his fist, in anger.  
真嗣再次紧握拳头，满腔怒火。

"So, I was right. Asuka choose to pilot Eva again, because…"  
"所以，我猜对了。明日香选择再次驾驶 Eva，是因为……"

"Because she thought that this was the best way to ensure your safety."  
"因为她认为这是确保你安全的最佳方式。"

"W-what?" "什...什么？"

"She was chosen as the pilot by the people of Euronerv, since she trained with them for almost a decade. We received the request from the UN and told her that we would try our best to keep her here if she wanted to, but, like I said, it was already hard for us to keep both of you safe from our own people. So, she decided to go. Because, she knew that you would rather die than pilot Eva again. But she expressly asked us to not tell you about her decision. And we honored her request until now"  
"她被欧罗纳夫人民选为驾驶员，因为她与他们一同训练了近十年。我们收到了联合国的请求，并告诉她，如果她愿意留下，我们会尽全力保护她。但正如我所说，我们自己的人民已经让保护你们两人变得异常艰难。因此，她决定离开。因为她知道，你宁愿死也不愿再次驾驶 Eva。但她明确要求我们不要告诉你她的决定。我们一直尊重她的请求，直到现在。"

"I… I don't think that Asuka would… hey, wait. Why until now?"  
"我……我不认为明日香会……嘿，等等。为什么是直到现在？"

The man looked at the boy with a serious, but sad expression.  
男人严肃而悲伤地看着男孩。

"Our contacts here have informed us that… the man behind this scheme is… Gendo Ikari."  
"我们在这里的联系人告诉我们……策划这一切的人是……碇源堂。"

My counterpart on the screen opened his eyes, in a mixture of astonishment, fear and despair.  
屏幕上的我的对手睁开了眼睛，混合着惊讶、恐惧和绝望。

"He planned this from the beginning and now he has a functional Evangelion Unit and also Asuka, who is probably unaware of his great scheme and being forced to pilot it under his command."  
"他从一开始就策划了这一切，现在他不仅拥有了一台可运作的 EVA 初号机，还有明日香，她可能还不知道他的巨大阴谋，被迫在他的指挥下驾驶它。"

Asuka…. being forced to pilot… by father? Why. Why father was doing this? He knew what happened. He knew that mother was gone, forever.  
明日香……被迫驾驶……由父亲？为什么。为什么父亲要这么做？他知道发生了什么。他知道母亲已经永远离开了。

"However, his plan had a flaw. He wasn't able to collect all the remaining of Unit 02's core. Therefore, the artificial S2 engine is not working."  
然而，他的计划有一个漏洞。他无法收集到二号机核心的所有剩余部分。因此，人工 S2 引擎无法运作。

"Is this…. good news?" 这是……好消息吗？

"Sadly not. Since the missing pieces of the core are here in Japan, Ikari has started, with UN council approval, a military campaign that aims to retrieve them. By force. And with an Evangelion that is able to generate an AT-Field on his side, no military force on Earth can stop him. Unless…"  
"遗憾的是并非如此。由于核心缺失的部分在日本，碇司令在联合国理事会的批准下，启动了一项旨在夺回这些核心的军事行动。以武力手段。而且，他拥有一台能够生成 AT 力场的 EVA，地球上没有任何军事力量能够阻止他。除非……"

"The Jet Alone… but I don't think that it will be enough. I've fought that thing before. There is no way that it will be able to defeat Asuka! And, also, it cannot generate an AT-Field."  
"Jet Alone……但我认为这还不够。我曾与那东西交过手。它绝不可能打败明日香！而且，它也无法生成 AT 力场。"

"You're right. That's why we Ibuki and the others are using the remaining core pieces of Unit 02 to create an entry plug that will allow a human pilot to control the Jet Alone and also project a functional AT-Field."  
"你说得对。这就是为什么我们伊吹和其他人正在利用二号机剩余的核心部件来制造一个插入栓，使人类驾驶员能够操控 Jet Alone 并同时生成有效的 AT 力场。"

Shinj got up on his feet, finally realizing what was the reason of this conversation.  
真嗣站起身来，终于明白了这次对话的缘由。

"You…. you want me to pilot this thing to fight against Asuka?"  
“你……你想让我驾驶这东西去对抗明日香？”

"That's what the world is asking to you. But what I, Jima, and several other people are asking you is to save Asuka. And the world. I know that we don't deserve that and that is a lot to ask, but the truth is that we don't have much time for trying to make things ready for that counteroffensive. So, Shinji Ikari…. what's your answer?  
"“这是世界对你的要求。但我，吉马，还有其他一些人请求你的是拯救明日香。以及这个世界。我知道我们不配得到这样的帮助，这要求太过分了，但事实是我们没有太多时间来准备这场反击。所以，碇真嗣……你的回答是什么？”

Shinji looked away and stared at the wall that was still marked with blood from his hands and forehead.  
真嗣移开视线，凝视着那面仍留有他双手和额头血迹的墙壁。

After several seconds passed by, he looked at the man, straight in his eye, and gave him the answer.  
几秒钟过去后，他直视着那人的眼睛，给出了回答。

*flash. *闪现。

---

The Shinji on the screen was wrapped in a blanket, staring at the sleeping form of Asuka. The girl was cute when she was asleep, even though she got no care at all for her appearance, especially after she was able to remove her plugsuit and her bandages. She settled to wear just an over-sized green jacket and panties and also improvised another bandage that looked like an eye-patch to cover her eye.  
屏幕上的真嗣裹着一条毯子，凝视着熟睡中的明日香。女孩睡着时很可爱，尽管她完全不在意自己的外表，尤其是在她能够脱下插入栓服和绷带之后。她选择只穿一件过大的绿色夹克和内裤，并用一个看起来像眼罩的自制绷带遮住眼睛。

Since we that moment after that rough first day, she refrains to talk with me more than the minimum necessary. I'ts natural. I've come to accept the fact that we the is no hope for us. It's kinda like to fly a plane with broken wings. Only ashes remained from our previous relation… interactions that we had, so I've got no room in her heart. I will always be just only another constant source of pain for her. And nothing will ever change that.  
自从那个艰难的第一天之后，她避免与我交谈超过必要的最低限度。这很自然。我已经接受了我们之间没有希望的事实。这有点像驾驶一架翅膀破损的飞机。我们之前的联系只剩下灰烬……那些我们曾有的互动，所以我在她心中没有位置。我将永远只是她另一个持续的痛苦来源。而这一点永远不会改变。

But sometimes, just like it happened on that night, she opted to lay down to sleep next to me.  
但有时，就像那个夜晚发生的那样，她选择躺下睡在我旁边。

Maybe because she always has been afraid of the dark, or of the sound of rain that could be heard even underneath this shelter. Heh, it's ironic that my idiotic act of cowardice was somehow useful, since I was forced to know about those shelters that were designed for enduring apocalyptic events and, fortunately, they showed that it was no propaganda. It was good enough to aid the survival of two kids, at least for some months.  
也许因为她一直害怕黑暗，或是这个庇护所下也能听到的雨声。嘿，讽刺的是，我那愚蠢的懦弱行为竟然有些用处，因为我被迫了解了那些为抵御末日事件而设计的庇护所，幸运的是，它们证明并非宣传，足够帮助两个孩子生存，至少维持了几个月。

Sure, those days in that shelter were utterly boring. I didn't mind it at all. Except when that happened.  
当然，那些在避难所的日子真是无聊透顶。我一点也不介意。除了那次发生的事情。

"Asuka? Are you ok? Hey… wake up! Wake!"  
“明日香？你还好吗？嘿……醒醒！快醒醒！”

She was having another nightmare. A rather brutal one. And his screams weren't making any effect. So, Shinji, in despair, did the better thing that he could do at that moment. He picked up a gun. And shoot.  
她又在经历一场噩梦。相当残酷的那种。而他的尖叫声毫无作用。于是，真嗣在绝望中做了当时他能做的最好的事。他拿起一把枪。然后开枪。

Straight into the wall of the other side of the shelter, making a huge noise.  
直直撞上了避难所另一侧的墙壁，发出巨大的声响。

"W-what?" "什...什么？"

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

"What the hell is happening here, third? Are we under attack?"  
“这里到底发生了什么，老三？我们被攻击了吗？”

"No… it's just…" “不……只是……”

She looked at the gun in his hand and stopped, retreating herself in fear and moving away from him.  
她看着他手中的枪，停下了脚步，因恐惧而退缩，远离了他。

"What the fuck are you doing? Trying to end what you've started on the beach?"  
“你他妈在干什么？想结束你在海滩上开始的一切吗？”

"No! You were having a nightmare and so I…"  
“不！你做了噩梦，所以我……”

"So, you decided to shoot a firearm because of that? You moron. Don't you know that bullets can bounce back? Are you that stupi…"  
"所以，你就因为那件事决定开枪？你这个白痴。你不知道子弹会反弹吗？你真有那么蠢……"

"I'M SORRY, OK?" – he shouted, making the girl stop talking – "You…. you were having a nightmare. A bad one. So that's why I did it."  
"我很抱歉，好吗？" – 他大喊道，让女孩停止了说话 – "你……你正在做噩梦。一个很糟糕的梦。所以我才这么做的。"

"Oh sure. And you couldn't have wakened me up in any other way?"  
"哦，当然。你就不能用其他方法叫醒我吗？"

"No. I'm not allowed to get near you and I won't do it."  
"不，我不能靠近你，我也不会这么做。"

She looked at him, visibly surprised, and with a mix of proud and disappointment in her look, as she realized that he indeed has been honoring the request that she made after they meet at the beach.  
她看着他，明显感到惊讶，眼中混杂着骄傲与失望，当她意识到他确实一直在遵守他们在海滩相遇后她提出的请求。

"Asuka... A few weeks ago, on that beach, I was... what I did... And that's not even the worst thing that I've done to you. But you were kind to me... you... didn't reject me this time. I don't know if I will be able to not hurt you again that's why... I will honor your request and will keep my distance, but I'm not running away anymore.  
"明日香...几周前，在那个海滩上，我...我所做的...那甚至不是我对你做过的最糟糕的事。但你对我很友善...你...这次没有拒绝我。我不知道我是否能再次不伤害你，所以...我会尊重你的请求，保持距离，但我不会再逃避了。"

I know that my presence disgusts you and that you have every right to take revenge on me. But things around here... are not easy. Besides, I've also seen what you wanted... what you need. That's why... even if I failed you before... I will try again... I will help y..."  
我知道我的存在令你厌恶，你有充分的理由向我复仇。但这里的情况...并不简单。此外，我也看到了你所渴望的...你所需要的。这就是为什么...即使我之前让你失望了...我还会再试一次...我会帮助你...

"Stop it!" – she said with a cold and, yet, soft voice.  
“住手！”——她用一种冷淡却又柔和的声音说道。

"I know you will never forgive me. So, I just want you to tell me how close you want me to be. We're partners!"  
“我知道你永远不会原谅我。所以，我只想让你告诉我，你希望我离你多近。我们是搭档！”

"Partners, huh? Is that what we are now?"  
"搭档，是吗？我们现在算是这种关系了？"

"I... don't know." "我... 不知道。"

"Of course, you don't! Get something straight, idiot. We really aren't anything and never will be. We are just two people who know everything about what is in each other's hearts. No masks, no nothing. The good things and the bad things that we wanted to keep hidden forever. I saw all the disgusting things you did and you also saw how rotten inside I really am. Why keep doing this? Why live in this shitty world?  
"当然，你不知道！搞清楚点，白痴。我们真的什么都不是，也永远不会是。我们只是两个了解彼此内心一切的人。没有面具，什么都没有。那些我们想要永远隐藏的好事和坏事。我看到了你所做的所有恶心事，你也看到了我内心真正的腐烂。为什么还要继续这样？为什么要活在这个糟糕的世界里？"

"If… if you want to..."  
"如果…如果你愿意的话..."

"No! Damn, are you really that stupid? I already said I won't let an idiot like you kill me. I don't want to die."  
"不！该死，你真的那么蠢吗？我已经说过我不会让像你这样的白痴杀了我。我不想死。"

"O-ok... you won't. I will do everything to…."  
"好-好的...你不会的。我会尽一切努力去…."

"Idiot! I've told you before. Just don't do anything, because everything you do is hurt me. I needed your help before. I don't 't need it now or ever again. So just be quiet, okay? I don't need a babysitter, much less to be taken care of by a spoiled child."  
"白痴！我之前就告诉过你。别做任何事，因为你做的每件事都伤害了我。我以前需要你的帮助。现在不需要，以后也永远不会需要。所以就安静点，好吗？我不需要保姆，更不用说被一个被宠坏的孩子照顾。"

"You... you're right, Asuka. But you're also wrong."  
"你...你说得对，明日香。但你也错了。"

She looked at him with an angry glare.  
她用愤怒的目光看着他。

"It's true that I'm still a child and maybe I really am an idiot, but I certainly learned something from all this... Mostly... well... about you."  
"没错，我确实还是个孩子，也许我真的挺傻的，但我从这一切中学到了一些东西……主要是……嗯……关于你的一些事。"

"Oh really? Ah, yes, I forgot that you were inside of my damn mind! So, tell me something that I don't know already, idiot."  
"哦，真的吗？啊，对了，我忘了你在我该死的脑子里！那么，告诉我一些我还不知道的事吧，傻瓜。"

"I'm not talking about that. I didn't get it at the time, but after our… conversation, Rei and Kaworu showed me what I couldn't understand. And I learned that you are who you are, Asuka. I have no right to ask anything of you or think that I have made or can make any difference in your life. And that's exactly why I won't be afraid to say or hide anything from you anymore. You know that I need you. And you know that I won't run away as long as you need me and, despite of your pride, you really need me right now."  
"我不是在说那个。当时我没明白，但在我们……交谈之后，丽和薰向我展示了我不懂的东西。我明白了，你就是你，明日香。我没有权利向你要求什么，也没有资格认为我能对你的生活产生任何影响。而这正是为什么我不会再害怕对你说或隐瞒任何事情。你知道我需要你。你也知道，只要你需要我，我就不会逃跑，尽管你很骄傲，但你现在真的需要我。"

"You... how dare you? I…aaargh" - the girl took a deep breath – "Look...I don't want to do that. I know you actually want to help now and I really don't want to fight with you. But please...stay away from me."  
"你...你怎么敢？我…啊啊啊" - 女孩深吸了一口气 – "听着...我不想那样做。我知道你现在真的想帮忙，我真的不想和你争吵。但请...离我远点。"

"It's like I told you, you have every right to hate me. But like you said yourself, we're in this together, remember? Our mission isn't over yet."  
"就像我告诉你的，你有充分的理由恨我。但就像你自己说的，我们是一起的，记得吗？我们的任务还没结束。"

"Idiot…. I already told you. I don't hate you. I should hate you. But I know that you're just as fucked up as I am."  
"笨蛋….我已经告诉过你了。我不恨你。我应该恨你。但我知道你和我一样糟糕。"

The two just sit down, tired of arguing, looking away from each other. Several minutes passed, until Asuka broke the silence.  
两人只是坐下，厌倦了争吵，彼此避开目光。几分钟过去了，直到明日香打破了沉默。

"You know what, third? This whole thing is a tremendous piece of shit. We should have had the chance to be kids. To live the stupid things that kids do. To have a real family. With mothers and fathers present in our lives!  
“你知道吗，第三适格者？这一切简直就是一坨巨大的狗屎。我们本该有机会做个孩子。去做那些孩子们做的蠢事。拥有一个真正的家庭。有母亲和父亲在我们的生活中！”

We should have had the chance to grow up, to meet people, to have friends, to fall in love... not to live a shitty life piloting Eva to make me feel special or to please idiot adults who used us as tools to fight monsters that hurt us in body and soul. And suddenly, after all that, the world becomes... this. And now?  
我们本该有机会长大，去遇见人，交朋友，谈恋爱……而不是过着驾驶 EVA 的糟糕生活，让我感觉自己很特别，或是取悦那些把我们当工具来对抗伤害我们身心怪物的白痴大人。然后，在经历了这一切之后，世界变成了……这样。现在呢？

Nothing that we have lived and been all our lives makes sense anymore. Look, I'm not trying to be a bitch here but... the fact is that we will never again be able to be comfortable with each other's presence. It's like..."  
我们一生中所经历和拥有的一切，如今都变得毫无意义。听着，我不是想在这里发牢骚，但...事实是我们再也无法坦然面对彼此的存在了。这感觉就像...

"Like we've just ended a relationship... of a lifetime. Without ever really being together. And yet we can't even stay away from each other because circumstances won't allow it. It hurts."  
就像我们刚刚结束了一段...一生的关系。从未真正在一起过。然而我们却无法远离对方，因为环境不允许。这很痛苦。

"Y... yes..." - he said with a faint blush over her cheeks - "That's...actually a good definition."  
“是...是的...”——他带着淡淡的红晕说道——“这...实际上是个很好的定义。”

An awkward silence was formed for another few minutes, until the boy dared to ask a question.  
又是一阵尴尬的沉默持续了几分钟，直到男孩鼓起勇气问了一个问题。

"Asuka... do you think that... maybe…. if things were different... or if we gave ourselves some time, we could have..."  
“明日香……你觉得……也许……如果情况不同……或者我们给自己一些时间，我们本可以……”

"No."

Her quick response made the boy lower his head, ashamed of his dumb attempt and idiotic glimmer of hope that refused to die.  
她迅速的回答让男孩低下了头，为自己的愚蠢尝试和那不肯熄灭的愚蠢希望感到羞愧。

"We... you shouldn't think about love or such silly things anymore. This is not instrumentality anymore. It is the real world. We don't even know who we are anymore and what kind of life we will have from now on. And beyond that." - she said with a sad and distant look - "It's like I told you. How can anyone love a person after seeing the worst faults and worst attitudes they have done and are capable of doing? And how can you be loved by another person who has also seen all the rottenest side of your soul? It is impossible. There are things, thoughts and feelings that must be kept forever and nothing and no one can just... violate."  
"我们...你不应该再考虑爱情或这类愚蠢的事情了。这不再是工具化世界了，这是现实世界。我们甚至不知道自己是谁，从今往后会有怎样的生活。而且..." - 她带着悲伤而遥远的眼神说道 - "就像我告诉过你的。一个人在看到对方最糟糕的缺点和最恶劣的行为后，怎么可能还会爱那个人？而你又如何能被一个同样见过你灵魂最腐朽一面的人所爱？这是不可能的。有些事情、思想和感情必须永远保留，没有任何人和事可以...侵犯。"

I knew exactly what she was referring to. Another failure for my collection.  
我完全明白她在说什么。这又是我收藏中的又一次失败。

"You are right. I'm sor... I shouldn't have asked... We will... find a way to work together... as we always did. I will be right over there. If you need something, just ask me, ok?  
"你说得对。我很抱歉...我不该问的...我们会...找到合作的方式...像我们一直做的那样。我会就在那边。如果你需要什么，尽管告诉我，好吗？"

She didn't answer. The boy leaned on a close wall and closed his eyes, waiting for sleep to overcome him, until he heard her voice again.  
她没有回答。男孩靠在近旁的墙上，闭上眼睛，等待睡意袭来，直到再次听到她的声音。

"You mentioned that you've talked to Wondergirl and that weird homo-angel in that place, right."  
“你提过和神奇女孩还有那个奇怪的同性天使在那地方聊过，对吧。”

"Yes." "是的。"

"I didn't know that." “我之前不知道。”

"Oh… well, after our… conversation… I went to a weird place. I was kinda trapped an infinite circle of death and rebirth. I think it's what they call samsara in Buddhism."  
"哦……嗯，在我们……交谈之后……我去了个奇怪的地方。我被困在一个无尽的生死轮回中。我想这在佛教里被称为轮回。"

"That makes no sense for me, what does that mean?"  
"这对我来说毫无意义，那是什么意思？"

"It's like living several different lives."  
"就像是经历了好几种不同的生活。"

The girl suddenly got anxious and got up on her feet.  
女孩突然感到焦虑，站了起来。

"Eeeh? So you mean that you're now like, a thousand years old or something like that?"  
“诶？你是说你现在就像，一千岁什么的？”

"What? No, no…. not this. I didn't really live all those lives. It was kind of… sitting on a chair at the cinema and watching a movie, but several different movies at the same time and all of them got into my head. I… remember only a few things about them, actually."  
“什么？不，不……不是这样。我没有真正活过那些人生。那感觉就像……坐在电影院里看电影，但同时看好几部不同的电影，所有情节都涌入我的脑海。我……实际上只记得它们中的一些片段。”

"That's curious. For me… it was not like that. I kinda was… in the bardo, or the purgatory or something like that… maybe it's because I was born and raised in a culture with a different conception of hell."  
"真奇怪。对我来说……情况并非如此。我有点像是……在中间状态，或是炼狱之类的地方……也许是因为我出生并成长在一个对地狱有不同概念的文化中。"

"Yeah… maybe…" "是啊……或许吧……"

"So, tell me more about those other lives of yours."  
"那么，再多跟我说说你那些前世的故事吧。"

"W-what?" "什...什么？"

"You've heard me. I will not be able to sleep again for a while thanks to your stupid decision of waking me up with the sound of a bullet being shot. Besides, if we are really partners, you shouldn't hide information from me. Everything that you remember may be important for us to decide what we are gonna do. We can't stay here forever."  
"你已经听到了。因为你的愚蠢决定，用子弹射击的声音把我吵醒，我恐怕一时半会儿是睡不着了。而且，如果我们真的是伙伴，你不应该对我隐瞒信息。你记得的每一件事都可能对我们决定下一步行动至关重要。我们不能永远待在这里。"

The girl's mood had changed again. She was regaining her fire and entering in "pilot mode", determined to try to find more pieces that would allow her to think about a plan.  
女孩的情绪再次转变。她重燃斗志，进入“飞行员模式”，决心寻找更多线索，以便构思计划。

And while I loved her fire and determination, I was also worried.  
尽管我欣赏她的热情和决心，但我也感到担忧。

At that time, I didn't think that the best moments of my life after Eva were those quiet nights when we were successful in orchestrating the silence.  
那时，我未曾想过，在 Eva 之后，我生命中最美好的时刻竟是那些我们成功营造出宁静的夜晚。

But in the rare occasions she was willing to talk with me, I always got the sensation that we would end up hurting each other again, like in instrumentality. And that night wouldn't be different.  
但在她难得愿意与我交谈的时刻，我总有一种感觉，我们终将再次彼此伤害，就像在一体化时那样。而那个夜晚也不会例外。

I didn't know at the time, but that it won't be just another night, but our last moment before… tomorrow. The last time that I would see her face.  
当时我并不知晓，那不仅仅是一个寻常的夜晚，而是我们……明天之前的最后一刻。那是我最后一次见到她的面容。

Another change of scenario.  
场景再次转换。

I could recognize this cell, which had been my home for most of this time, and the scene showed my past version laying on the bed, with his ear touching the nearest wall.  
我能认出这个牢房，它曾是我大部分时间的栖身之所，画面显示过去的我躺在床上，耳朵紧贴着最近的墙壁。

It was on that day... after several months, that I could finally hear her voice again. And the fact that we were separated by a real wall, surprisingly, worked so well that the metaphorical walls were partially broken.  
就在那一天……经过数月之后，我终于再次听到了她的声音。而事实上，我们之间隔着一堵真实的墙，却出奇地好，象征性的隔阂也因此被部分打破了。

I was able to explain what I had tried unsuccessfully to say while we were still together in that shelter. It was a small moment of happiness. She deserved to know the truth, and I really needed to get it off my chest and out of my mind.  
我终于能解释清楚，在那个避难所里我们在一起时，我一直未能成功表达的话。那是一个小小的幸福时刻。她有权知道真相，而我真的需要将这些心事倾吐出来，从心头抹去。

But after I finished speaking, all I heard from the other side of my cell wall was the silence that lasted for minutes. Hours. Rationally, I should have accepted the fact that she was no longer there, and after hearing everything I had to say, she decided to leave.  
但当我讲完后，从牢房另一边传来的只有持续数分钟、数小时的沉默。理智上，我本该接受她已不在的事实，听完我所有的话后，她选择了离开。

It was expected. Asuka would never understand that we cannot escape our destiny. In all the universes I have seen in instrumentality, we always meet and fall in love. But that doesn't mean that we can stay together and be happy, because there is an unsolvable paradox.  
这是预料之中的。明日香永远不会明白，我们无法逃脱自己的命运。在我所见过的所有融合意识宇宙中，我们总会相遇并相爱。但这并不意味着我们可以永远在一起并幸福，因为存在一个无法解决的悖论。

Just like my father was, I'm doomed to always have to choose between sacrificing the world or trying to be with the woman I love.  
正如我父亲一样，我注定永远要在牺牲世界或试图与心爱的女人在一起之间做出选择。

In the universes that I've managed to save her and we were able be together, the Evangelions would eventually bring chaos and destruction to the world.  
在我设法救了她并能在一起的那些宇宙中，最终使徒们会带来混乱和毁灭。

In the universes that I've managed to save both her and the world, the price was too high. In the best-case scenarios, we would have to give up our memories and experiences and basically return to the same dilemma again: we would fall in love and the cycle of Evangelion would begin again.  
在我设法同时拯救了她与世界的那些宇宙中，代价太高了。在最理想的情况下，我们不得不放弃记忆和经历，基本上又回到了同样的困境：我们会再次相爱，使徒的循环又将重新开始。

So, I realized that, to save the world from the curse of Evangelion, I would have to give up the hope of being with her. She would find her place to be and be happy, and the world would be rewritten as a world without Evangelions. It would be the best possible ending for everybody.  
于是，我意识到，为了从《EVA》的诅咒中拯救世界，我必须放弃与她在一起的希望。她会找到自己的归宿并幸福，世界将被重写为一个没有 EVA 的世界。这对每个人来说都将是最美好的结局。

But I was weak. So instead of embracing that outcome, I asked Rei to return to this devastated world, instead of remaking the reality in a way that both Asuka and the world would be fine, even if I was heartbroken.  
但我很软弱。所以我没有接受那个结局，而是请求丽回到这个被摧毁的世界，而不是以一种即使我心碎，也能让明日香和世界都安好的方式重塑现实。

No, it's a lie. I didn't run away from that outcome. The truth is that I reject a good ending for everybody because I wanted to see her again.  
不，那是谎言。我没有逃避那个结局。真相是，我拒绝给每个人一个好结局，因为我想要再见她一面。

Yep. I'm disgusting. What kind of person would deny the opportunity to give everybody on the planet a chance of a good ending because of one's own egoistic needs and desires for something that is unobtainable? Now most of them are still drowned on those red oceans.  
没错，我真恶心。什么样的人会因为自己的自私需求和无法实现的欲望，而拒绝给地球上的每个人一个美好结局的机会呢？现在他们大多数人仍沉溺在那片血海之中。

After I woke up on that damn beach, I've already resigned to the fact that this was my fitting punishment for my selfishness. There is no way to rebuild from here.  
自从在那该死的沙滩上醒来后，我已经接受了这个事实：这是我自私行为的应有惩罚。从这里重建是不可能的。

I've failed them both: the world and the woman I love. I'm not a Buddha, a God or even an adult. Just a scared little child that vowed to, at least, try to learn to love himself and don't run away.  
我让他们都失望了：世界和我爱的女人。我不是佛陀，不是神，甚至不是个成年人。只是一个害怕的小孩，发誓至少要尝试学会爱自己，不再逃避。

But why I never have been able to just lose this damn hope?  
但为何我始终无法放弃这该死的希望？

I never expected her to return. But the screen was showing the moment when I heard her voice from the other side when I was almost falling asleep.  
我从没指望她会回来。但屏幕上显示的正是我几乎要睡着时，听到她从另一端传来的声音的那一刻。

"Already asleep, third? Well, I think it was a busy day for you so you must be really tired from doing absolutely nothing. Just like a baby. Instead of asking pen and paper to write stupid letters you should ask for a cello. At least is one decent hobby that you can still do, even being locked in a dumb cell."  
“已经睡着了，第三名？好吧，我想你今天一定很忙，忙到什么都没做，肯定累坏了。就像个婴儿一样。与其要笔和纸写那些愚蠢的信，不如要一把大提琴。至少那是个还算体面的爱好，即便被关在愚蠢的牢房里也能做。”

Classical Asuka, with her characteristic way of talking on the basis of irony and with her passive-aggressive humor. But I would not bear it that time. We were not children anymore and I didn't need to be afraid.  
典型的明日香，以讽刺为基础的说话方式，以及她那被动攻击式的幽默。但那次我无法忍受。我们不再是孩子了，我也不需要再害怕。

"Why you keep doing that, Asuka?" – the Shinji on screen responded.  
“你为什么总是这样做，明日香？”——屏幕上的真嗣回应道。

"Doing what?" "在做什么？"

"Always trying to be near me. First on the beach… and now. After all of the unforgivable things that I did to you. After all the times we hurt each other… why?"  
“总是试图靠近我。先是海滩上……现在又是。在我对你做了那么多不可原谅的事情之后。在我们彼此伤害了那么多次之后……为什么？”

"Listen here you…" "听着，你……"

"It was because you have fear of being alone?" – I could hear my counterpart interrupting her. - "Like you said before… it's just because we don't have nobody else to relate? Because you don't have anybody else, you are looking for me? For you anybody would, do it?"  
"是因为你害怕孤独吗？" – 我能听到我的另一个自己在打断她。- "就像你之前说的……只是因为我们没有其他人可以依靠？因为你没有其他人，你在找我？对你来说，任何人都可以，是吗？"

Several seconds of silence have passed by.  
几秒钟的沉默过去了。

"You're really an idiot. That's the key difference between us."  
"你真是个傻瓜。这就是我们之间最大的区别。"

"For you, anybody will do it. Because you would accept anyone that simply liked you and you would be ok with that just to not break the other person heart and for the pleasure of being loved and praised without having to do any effort to achieve it. Kinda like what you did while piloting the Eva.  
"对你来说，任何人都可以。因为你愿意接受任何一个仅仅喜欢你的人，只要不伤害对方的心，享受被爱和赞美的快感，而不需要付出任何努力去获得。有点像你驾驶 Eva 时的那种感觉。"

It's not the same with me. I hurt people. I don't accept anyone inside my heart. Nobody would like me if it wasn't for my looks or my status as genius and elite pilot. Heck, nobody would even tolerate the real me for a long time. Even Hikari was reaching her breaking point. But…" – she paused.  
"对我来说不是这样的。我伤害别人。我不会让任何人进入我的心。如果不是因为我的外貌或作为天才精英驾驶员的身份，没有人会喜欢我。甚至没有人能长时间忍受真正的我。就连光也快到极限了。但是…" – 她停顿了一下。

"But…" “但是…”

"I had the foolish dream that maybe you would. Because you also were a pilot… and you knew how bad it is. Not just piloting but everything else. I never needed to be saved or to be admired … but I wanted to be accepted and maybe loved by someone who could understand me and also challenge me to do better.  
"我曾愚蠢地梦想，也许你会理解。因为你也是一名飞行员……你知道这有多糟糕。不仅仅是驾驶，还有其他一切。我从未需要被拯救或被仰慕……但我渴望被某人接纳，也许被爱，一个能理解我并激励我做得更好的人。

You were my rival. But you were also my partner. You were… different. Do you know I trust you, right? Do you think that I would talk to anyone else like I'm talking to you right now?"  
你是我的对手。但也是我的伙伴。你……与众不同。你知道我信任你，对吧？你认为我会像现在这样对其他人说话吗？

"No." – I found myself answering in synchrony with the Shinji on the screen, on reflex.  
"不。" – 我不由自主地与屏幕上的真嗣同步回答，完全是下意识的反应。

"Heh, I guess you are not that stupid… if you only had realized that before… you had it all in your hands, third. You just needed to keep pushing back and don't give up on me. Like you did from the start on the ocean, on that stupid training… on the volcano."  
"嘿，看来你也没那么蠢……要是你早点意识到就好了……你本可以掌握一切，老三。你只需要坚持不懈，别放弃我。就像你最初在海上，在那愚蠢的训练中……在火山上的那样。"

The sincerity or her words was breaking me. I had it, didn't I? I had all the possibilities of making it right. And I squandered it.  
她话语中的真诚让我心碎。我本可以做到的，不是吗？我有所有让一切变好的可能。而我却挥霍了它。

"At first I tried to tease you to challenge you and to make you react. And eventually I tried to show you the cracks in my armor… I took risks… made myself vulnerable to you in a way I never did for anyone else." – she continued her monologue, uninterrupted.  
"起初我想逗你，挑战你，让你有所反应。后来我试图向你展示我盔甲上的裂缝……我冒险……以一种从未对其他人展现过的方式向你敞开了心扉。" – 她继续着她的独白，未被打断。

"I did it all to see if you would be able to be there for me, to reach out for me. But you didn't. You got tired of me and run away to seek comfort in better people. Or not even real people, like… Wondergirl and homo-angel."  
"我做这一切只是想看看你是否能在我需要时支持我，向我伸出援手。但你没有。你对我感到厌倦，跑去找更好的人寻求安慰。甚至不是真正的人，比如……神奇女孩和同性天使。"

I thought about scolding her for once again using those mean nicknames to reefer to two of the most important persons in my life, but there was something different in her voice this time. It was not filled with anger or sarcasm. It was more like… sadness?  
我本想训斥她又一次用这些刻薄的绰号称呼我生命中最重要的两个人，但这次她的声音里有些不同。没有愤怒或讽刺，更像是……悲伤？

"I've thought about our last conversation for many nights. And especially about them."  
"我许多个夜晚都在思考我们最后一次对话，尤其是关于他们。"

That phrase got both me and my counterpart on the screen by surprise.  
那句话让我们屏幕上的我和另一个我同时感到意外。

"Wond… Ayanami…I really wanted to be her friend at the start, even though I suck at reaching out to people without using a mask. So, when she didn't accept my offer and tried to get on my place by dancing with you and offering to dive into the volcano I was frightened by her competition. But as we worked together as a team, I started to respect her and even… tolerate her company in some way."  
“真希波……绫波……起初我真的想和她成为朋友，尽管我不擅长不戴面具与人接触。所以，当她没有接受我的邀请，反而试图通过和你跳舞并提议潜入火山来取代我的位置时，我被她的竞争吓到了。但随着我们一起作为团队合作，我开始尊重她，甚至在某种程度上……容忍她的陪伴。”

The Shinji on the screen almost fell down from his bed in surprise. Asuka and Ayanami? That's…  
屏幕上的真嗣差点从床上摔下来，惊讶不已。明日香和绫波？这……

"It pains me to admit that but, in the end, I guess that she was not a doll after all. She was made to be that way and still was able to overcome that destiny at the end. She changed, evolved, got better and still keep going strong until the end… while I've descended into darkness. It's no wonder that's why you were always more comfortable around her than with me. Even if she only did the simplest of the things, she was still miles ahead of me. She treated you and anybody else with respect and kindness. And, meanwhile I…. heh… I guess she really was the best girl after all."  
"承认这一点让我心痛，但最终，我想她毕竟不是个玩偶。她被塑造成那样，却仍能在最后战胜命运。她改变了，进化了，变得更好，并且一直坚强到最后……而我却堕入了黑暗。难怪你总是更愿意和她在一起而不是我。即使她只做了最简单的事情，她依然远远超越了我。她以尊重和善意对待你和任何人。而与此同时我……呵呵……我想她终究是最好的女孩。"

"What the heck?" – my counterpart spoke, loud, interrupting her - "I mean… don't say things like that, Asuka. You are yourself and Ayanami is Ayanami. And I… I think... we were a team, right? So, it was never a competition."  
"搞什么鬼？" – 我的对手大声说道，打断了她 - "我是说……别那样说，明日香。你是你自己，绫波是绫波。而我……我想……我们是一个团队，对吧？所以，从来都不是一场竞争。"

"Yeah, right… a team." – she still sounded defeated and depressed but I could identify a somewhat positive change in her voice, regaining a little of her old fire back - "Like things are that easy in the real world, third. But I guess you have a point. It was not a competition between us. That competition was only on my head because I was so damn insecure and afraid of losing the few good things that I had in my life.  
"“是啊，没错……一个团队。” 她的声音依旧带着挫败和沮丧，但我能听出她语气中略微的积极转变，找回了一丝昔日的斗志——“就像现实世界中事情那么简单似的，老三。但我想你说得有道理。那不是我们之间的竞争。那场竞争只存在于我脑海中，因为我太他妈不自信，害怕失去生活中仅有的几件好事。”

That's why I was jealous of her and also of you... because your presence and Invincible-Shinji performances made me feel worthless in the only thing that made me special: piloting Eva. And I also felt jealous of her and of Misato for….. whatever… the point is… I can see why you or … anybody else would like to be with Wo.. Ayanami, especially if she wasn't… made to be a doll by _diese beschissenen Schurken_!"  
"这就是为什么我嫉妒她，也嫉妒你……因为你的存在和无敌的碇真嗣表现让我在唯一让我与众不同的事情上感到无价值：驾驶 EVA。我也嫉妒她和美里……不管怎样……关键是……我能理解为什么你或……其他人会喜欢和绫波在一起，尤其是如果她不是……被那些该死的混蛋做成一个玩偶的话！”

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

"Just shut up and listen, will you? Well… thing is she was weird, but also…. beautiful and strong. And I guess that all of those doll-like traits… could in fact had been virtues… such as kindness and loyalty, especially for those ones that would be able to get her off her shell. Like you did. While I… wow… I was such a bitch to her. I can only hope that, despite all my teasing and harsh interactions to her, I could have been something more than just another source of pain to her c-crappy life."  
"闭嘴听我说，好吗？嗯…问题是她虽然古怪，但也…美丽而坚强。我想那些娃娃般的特质…实际上可能是美德…比如善良和忠诚，尤其是对那些能让她走出壳的人。就像你做的那样。而我…哇…我对她真是太刻薄了。我只希望，尽管我总是取笑她，对她态度恶劣，但我能成为她糟糕生活中不仅仅是另一个痛苦来源的存在。"

Even if I couldn't see her face, her trembling voice said it all. I never thought that Asuka had those kinds of opinion about Ayanami. But it all came clear now. Asuka tried to be her friend, in her own clumsy way. She respected and trusted in Rei's abilities during the battles the three of us fought together. She decided to go to that Ramen stand because it was one of the few places where Rei could eat vegetarian food. They could have been friends, so…. maybe it was… my fault?  
即使我看不到她的脸，她颤抖的声音已经说明了一切。我从没想过明日香对绫波有那样的看法。但现在一切都清楚了。明日香试图以她笨拙的方式成为她的朋友。她在与我们三人并肩作战的战斗中尊重并信任绫波的能力。她决定去那家拉面店，因为那是少数几个绫波能吃到素食的地方。她们本可以成为朋友，所以…也许这是…我的错？

"The same goes for…. Nagisa, right? I never meet him, but from what I've heard from you he was kinda like the perfect alpha guy. Handsome, clever, easy going, cultured and not afraid to show his feelings."  
"同样适用于…渚，对吧？我从未见过他，但根据你告诉我的，他有点像完美的阿尔法型男。英俊、聪明、随和、有教养，而且不怕表达自己的感情。"

"Y-yes… he was pretty much everything that… I'm not."  
"是的……他几乎拥有我所没有的一切。"

"Ooohh?! You're the one saying it, not me."  
"哦哦？！是你说的，可不是我。"

I could hear her chuckling. Even if I wasn't able to see her, I could imagine the triumphant smirk on her face.  
我能听到她的轻笑声。即使看不见她，我也能想象出她脸上那得意的微笑。

"But… I'm trying to be serious here, so let me finish. I guess he should have been really amazing, interesting and handsome to make you… fell in love with him. Really, I find it hard to believe that such a perfect guy could exist, but since you did fall in love with him and I know for sure that at least your penis swings to the other side…."  
"但……我正努力认真呢，让我说完。我想他一定非常出色、有趣且英俊，才能让你……爱上他。真的，我很难相信会有这么完美的家伙存在，但既然你确实爱上了他，而且我确信至少你的性取向是没问题的……"

Ouch… that comment made the Shinji on screen blush for several different reasons and I think I'm also blushing right now. Damn. Only Asuka is able to deliver those kinds of comments that make me feel several conflicting feelings at once.  
哎呀……那句话让屏幕上的真嗣因为多种原因脸红了，我想我现在也脸红了。该死。只有明日香能说出那种让我同时感到多种矛盾情绪的话。

"And giving the fact that Angels could appear in many different forms, I guess that it's possible. I mean, I don't know if he took that form and personality only to make you vulnerable so he would be able to attack us in a very efficient way. You know that I have my reasons to dislike those bastards. Especially the ones that intent to mess with our minds and feelings.  
"考虑到使徒可以以多种不同形态出现，我想这是有可能的。我是说，我不确定他是否只是为了让你变得脆弱，以便能以非常有效的方式攻击我们，才采用了那种形态和性格。你知道我有理由讨厌那些混蛋。尤其是那些意图扰乱我们心智和感情的家伙。"

But I guess that…if he wasn't born an angel and could still be just like he was being able to actively reach to you and offering you unconditional love…. It won't work that way with me, but if he somehow has molded his personality to give me what I've wanted I think that I…"  
但我想，如果他不是天生为天使，却仍能像现在这样，主动接近你，给予你无条件的爱……这种方式对我行不通，但如果他以某种方式塑造了自己的性格，给了我想要的，我想我……

"Asuka, I understand. I mean, you don't need" – the Shinji on the screen interrupted her in a rather sudden way.  
“明日香，我明白。我是说，你不需要”——屏幕上的真嗣突然打断了她，相当突兀。

"Of course, you don't understand! That's why I got so mad at you, idiot! I wanted to hit you so badly when you told me about how you could imagine being happy with other people. Because it's totally true. You're an idiot and wimp, but… when you're not being depressed or consumed by guilty… you're a kind person that is capable to do selfless acts for other people without demanding anything in return and even put yourself at risk to protect them.  
"“你当然不懂！所以我才对你那么生气，笨蛋！当你告诉我你能想象和其他人幸福生活时，我真想狠狠揍你一顿。因为这是真的。你是个笨蛋，懦夫，但……当你不抑郁或被罪恶感吞噬时……你是个善良的人，能为他人无私奉献，不求回报，甚至不惜冒险保护他们。”  
But I'm…. not like you. That's why I got so angry and… jealous of you. I didn't want you to do nice things for me… because I know that you would also do it for anybody. I wanted you to do those things to me, and only to me… because I wanted to have some kind of special place."  
但我……和你不一样。所以我才会那么生气，对你心生嫉妒。我不希望你对我好……因为我知道你也会对任何人这样。我希望你只对我一个人好……因为我想要拥有某种特别的位置。

She… was jealous… of me? I never expected to hear those words from her mouth.  
她……嫉妒我？我从没想过会从她嘴里听到这些话。

"I knew that if you wouldn't be able understand and accept me, nobody else would. But I also knew that you would always have other options to be happy with another person. It's like I said: if I can't have you all to myself, I don't want you at all. _Gott_, I'm such a selfish bitch.  
我知道，如果你不能理解和接受我，别人也不会。但我也知道，你总会有其他选择，和另一个人幸福地在一起。就像我说的：如果我不能完全拥有你，我宁愿不要你。天啊，我真是个自私的婊子。

I've put so much expectations into you, but didn't take into consideration your own troubles and the issues you were having at that time. You didn't help me. And I didn't help you. Not even at the end, at that time that you openly and desperately needed my help."  
我对你寄予了太多期望，却未曾考虑你自身的困扰和当时面临的问题。你没有帮助我。我也没有帮助你。甚至在最后，在你公开且迫切需要我帮助的时候，我也没有伸出援手。

Asuka…. 明日香…

"And now that you've told me… that you've seem those different realities in Instrumentality…. And you were so serious about it that I know that you were not lying… I finally realize one thing….  
而现在，你告诉我…你在人类补完计划中看到了那些不同的现实…你对此如此认真，我知道你并未撒谎…我终于明白了一件事…

"It was not 'Asuka' who you could not accept the existence and make the effort to be together with. It was… just the real me that you couldn't stand. Isn't it?"  
"你无法接受并努力与之共处的，不是'明日香'。而是……你无法忍受的真实的我。不是吗？"

I froze, in synchrony with the Shinji on the screen. He began to stutter, trying to search for the right words. But, no matter how hard he tried, he could not pronounce any sound. How could he answer this question without returning to all the unsolvable drama they had experienced several times before? It all went back to that fateful meeting in Misato's apartment during the instrumentality where no matter how much he confessed his feelings, Asuka would call him a liar and the cycle of hatred would return.  
我僵住了，与屏幕上的真嗣同步。他开始结巴，试图寻找合适的词句。但无论他怎么努力，都无法发出任何声音。他该如何回答这个问题，而不再次陷入他们之前经历过的那些无法解决的戏剧性冲突中呢？一切都回到了那个决定性的相遇，在融合过程中，无论他在美里公寓里如何坦露心声，明日香都会称他为骗子，仇恨的循环再次开始。

"No… I guess in the end it was all my fault, wasn't it? I've put so much expectations into you, but I also was selfish and didn't take into consideration your own troubles and the issues you were having at that time. You didn't help me. But I also didn't help you. Not even at the end, at that time that you openly and desperately needed my help. What was it again that you and the other Stooges called me? The Red Devil? Isn't that right?"  
"不……我想归根结底都是我的错，对吧？我对你寄予了太多期望，但我也很自私，没有考虑到你当时的困境和问题。你没有帮助我。但我也没有帮助你。甚至在最后，在你公开且迫切需要我的帮助时，我也没有伸出援手。你和其他人又是怎么称呼我的？红色恶魔？对吧？"

"I-I never..." "我从没……"

"They were right. I always act horrible to people... and still kept a mask on to make myself feel superior and not caring if my behavior would hurt people. Heh... no wonder everyone abandoned me."  
"他们说得对。我总是对人们态度恶劣……还戴着面具让自己感觉高人一等，不在乎我的行为是否会伤害到别人。呵呵……难怪大家都离我而去了。"

The Shinji on the screen made a sad face and I once again immediately mirrored his expression. If there is one thing that has always bothered me it is to see Asuka on her depressive side.  
屏幕上的真嗣露出了悲伤的表情，我再次立刻模仿了他的表情。如果说有什么一直困扰着我的，那就是看到明日香抑郁的一面。

As much as I know that this side is also a part of her, I know that that her confidence and pride are not just a façade.  
尽管我知道这一面也是她的一部分，但我知道她的自信和骄傲绝非只是表象。

Her fire, her drive... it's real. When she is like that, I feel better. When I'm with her I feel that I… we can achieve everything.  
她的热情，她的动力……都是真实的。当她那样时，我感觉更好。和她在一起时，我感觉我们……能够达成一切。

"Asuka…you...you know that's not true! Misato and Kaji had their problems, but they always cared about you. Hikari was always by your side too and even Ayanami cared about you."  
“明日香……你……你知道那不是真的！美里和加持虽然有问题，但他们一直关心你。光也总是陪在你身边，甚至连绫波也关心你。”

"And what about you?" "那你呢？"

"You know the answer." "你知道答案的。"

"Why? You are the one that suffered the most because of my actions and, apparently, I made a point of taking it harder on you than I did on other people. You were right when you decided to strangle me."  
"为什么？正是因为我的行为，你承受了最多的痛苦，显然，我对你比对其他人更为严苛。你当时决定掐死我，是正确的。"

"I wasn't..." "我并没有..."

"YES, YOU WERE! You... Ikari, from the beginning… all I wanted to do was destroy you… because you were a threat to my number one pilot status, which was the most important thing in my life. And what annoyed me the most was that even though you didn't care about that, you were always the best...and people always gave you all the credit you deserved."  
"不，你有！你...碇，从一开始…我只想摧毁你…因为你威胁到了我第一驾驶员的地位，那是我生命中最重要的事情。最让我恼火的是，尽管你对此毫不在意，你却总是最优秀的...人们总是把所有应得的赞誉都给了你。"

"Asuka, I..." "明日香，我..."

I should have told her that was a lie. I didn't deserve any credit. Most of the time it was Eva who won the battles for me, ... or because of my mother or even that Dummy System... Unit 01 was different from all the others, because it was made from Lilith. In most of the other battles I only succeeded because I had Asuka, Ayanami, Misato and all the technical staff from Nerv supporting me. And when I was really alone, I only won because Kaworu offered no resistance at the end. If I understood better everything that was happening and Asuka's feelings ... maybe her synchronization rate wouldn't have sunk and everything could have been different. But, as usual, I couldn't find the words.  
我本该告诉她那是个谎言。我不配得到任何赞誉。大多数时候，是伊娃为我赢得了战斗，...或者是因为我的母亲，甚至是那个笨蛋系统...初号机与众不同，因为它是由莉莉丝制成的。在其他大多数战斗中，我之所以能成功，是因为有明日香、绫波、美里以及 NERV 的所有技术人员支持我。而当我真正孤身一人时，我之所以能赢，只是因为渚薰在最后没有抵抗。如果我能更好地理解所发生的一切和明日香的感情...也许她的同步率不会下降，一切可能都会不同。但一如既往，我找不到那些话。

"LET ME FINISH, DAMN IT! Don't you know how hard it is?!"  
“让我说完，该死的！你不知道这有多难吗？！”

After her small outburst she resumed talking.  
在她短暂的爆发后，她继续说道。

"Look, I'll try to explain to you one more time. I didn't hate you because you took a position that I wanted for myself and that was the biggest goal of my life. I hated you because you never valued it and, even though you were the best, you still acted like an idiot who wanted to run away all the time. It seemed that your false modesty was just an act, done on purpose to annoy me.  
"听着，我再试着向你解释一次。我并不是因为你抢了我想要的位置，那是我人生的最大目标，才恨你。我恨你是因为你从未珍惜它，即使你是最好的，你仍然表现得像个总是想逃跑的傻瓜。你的那种虚假的谦逊，似乎只是故意用来惹恼我的。

But what I hated the most was that... I couldn't really hate you. I never could because... after seeing what you could do, the way you behaved in training and in battles... the way you cared and looked after Misato and me... I began to admire you."  
但我最恨的是...我真的无法恨你。我从未能做到，因为...在看到你的能力，你在训练和战斗中的表现...你对我和美里照顾的方式...我开始敬佩你。

Asuka admired… me? No… I've saw her mind. I knew that she had all sorts of feelings towards me but…. admiration?  
明日香敬佩...我？不...我看过她的内心。我知道她对我有各种各样的感情，但...敬佩？

"Then I tried to get closer to you. To give you all the tips in the world that a girl can do without running the risk of getting dumped. The walls of Jericho, the thermal expansion, trying to wear more provocative clothes when walking around the house... I even accepted an invitation to go out with someone else to see if you would care or take action. And you didn't even care. I was so angry that I abandoned that date as soon as I got the chance. And after that...I set up a whole context just to have a lame excuse to kiss you. And you didn't do anything. You didn't even hold me."  
"然后我试图更接近你。想尽一切办法，一个女孩在不冒被甩风险的情况下所能做的所有提示。像攻破耶利哥城墙，利用热胀冷缩，尝试在家中穿着更挑逗的衣服走动...我甚至接受了别人的约会邀请，想看看你是否会在意或采取行动。而你根本不在乎。我气得一有机会就甩掉了那个约会。之后...我设计了一整套情境，只为找个蹩脚的借口吻你。而你什么都没做。你甚至没有抱紧我。"

Yes. I wanted to. But I didn't. I'm a coward.  
是的。我曾想这么做。但我没有。我是个懦夫。

"From that moment on I was lost... I couldn't keep fooling myself that I didn't feel anything for you anymore... but you did nothing about it and continued to be the number one pilot, the invincible Shinji Ikari, while I became even more useless.  
"从那一刻起我就迷失了...我再也无法欺骗自己对你没有任何感觉...但你对此无动于衷，继续做你的头号飞行员，无敌的碇真嗣，而我变得更加无用。

After you were absorbed by Eva and took thirty days to return... I really wanted to hate you. Because not only did you show again that how useless I was as a pilot you also showed me how much I missed you in my life. And I had the feeling that I would never see you again. Whether it was to get my revenge and chance to show that I was better than you...or to be able to have you back with me so we could go to school together... be able to eat the food you made and spend the afternoons and evenings together with you.  
在你被 Eva 吸收并花了三十天才回来之后...我真的想恨你。因为你不仅再次证明了我作为驾驶员的无能，还让我意识到我的生活中有多么想念你。我有一种感觉，我再也见不到你了。无论是为了复仇和机会展示我比你更优秀...还是为了能让你回到我身边，我们可以一起去上学...能吃到你做的饭，和你一起度过下午和晚上。

And when you returned from inside Eva...you preferred to spend your time with Wond... Ayanami than with me. I had nothing left... and right after that damn angel came!"  
而当你从 Eva 里回来时...你宁愿和 Wond...绫波待在一起，也不愿和我在一起。我一无所有...就在那该死的天使出现之后！

I looked away from the screen, in shame. That was one of my most painful memories. The only time that I really wanted to fight. And my bastard father denied me the chance of making it right.  
我羞愧地移开了视线。那是我的痛苦记忆之一。唯一一次我真正想战斗的时刻。而我那混蛋父亲却剥夺了我改正的机会。

"That was the one time I really expected the invincible Shinji Ikari to show up to save me. But the one who did show up was Ayanami. And she appeared only to kill the angel, saving me was only a consequence. After that I didn't feel like living anymore. I couldn't even make my Eva move in the next battle. I was destroying myself and nobody else cared. And after you told me about Kaji I... I..."  
"那是我唯一一次真正期待无敌的碇真嗣出现来救我。但出现的却是绫波。她来只是为了消灭使徒，救我只是个附带结果。那之后我再也不想活下去了。我甚至无法在接下来的战斗中让我的 Eva 动起来。我正在自我毁灭，而没有人关心。而你告诉我关于加持的事情后，我...我..."

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

I noticed that, for the first time since we have returned from instrumentality, she called me by my first name.  
我注意到，自从我们回归实体化以来，她第一次叫了我的名字。

"What hurt the most were not the times you didn't noticed or returned my feelings. And not the times you were not there to help me in combat. And not even the fact that when I wanted and needed your help the most, you were not there. The worst of it all was seeing that deep down you wanted me, but only as one of your jerk-off fantasies. You wanted a doll, a concept, someone who would accept you unconditionally. That's why you only took any action while I was unconscious, damn it!"  
"最让我受伤的不是你没注意到或回应我的感情的时候。也不是你在战斗中没有来帮助我的时候。甚至不是在我最需要你帮助的时候你不在的事实。最糟糕的是，我发现你内心深处想要我，但只是作为你的性幻想对象。你想要一个玩偶，一个概念，一个无条件接受你的人。这就是为什么你只在我昏迷时采取行动，该死！"

The girl stopped talking and chuckled, like she just remembered a funny joke.  
女孩停止了说话，轻声笑了起来，仿佛刚刚想起了一个有趣的笑话。

"You've… heh… you've destroyed me in every way imaginable... you destroyed me as a pilot and you also destroyed my heart. But deep down I got what I deserved didn't I? Even in the fantasy worlds you created in instrumentality I caused you suffering. I guess even if you were able to turn the world into a place of perfect peace and happiness, where nothing could hurt you, I would not be a beautiful _Rosenrot__,_ but the only real thorn in your way that would remember you that pain exist. Well…. I guess that's all."  
“你……呵呵……你以各种能想象到的方式摧毁了我……你毁了我作为飞行员的身份，也毁了我的心。但内心深处，我得到了应有的报应，不是吗？即使在你在‘意识融合’中创造的幻想世界里，我也给你带来了痛苦。我想，即使你能把世界变成一个完美和平与幸福的地方，在那里没有任何东西能伤害你，我也不会成为一个美丽的玫瑰红，而是唯一真实的荆棘，让你记住痛苦的存在。好吧……我想就这些了。”

She stopped talking. And only silence remained. My counterpart was just flabbergasted by what he just had heard. He would need several days or maybe a life time to fully process Asuka's words.  
她停止了说话。只剩下沉默。我的同位体被他刚刚听到的话惊呆了。他需要几天甚至可能是一生的时间来完全理解明日香的话语。

"I won't bother you anymore. I'll ask Ibuki to return to my other cell."  
"我不会再打扰你了。我会让伊布基回到我的另一个牢房。"

"DON'T! Please, don't" - he shouted with a desperate voice. "You... you can stay here if you... no, I mean... I don't want to los... I want you to..."  
"不要！求你了，不要" - 他用绝望的声音喊道。"你...你可以留在这里，如果你...不，我是说...我不想失去...我想要你..."

I could hear she sighing. With good reason this time, I'm forced to admit. The pathetic Shinji on the screen really was acting like I was a scared 14 years old boy again.  
我能听到她在叹气。这次确实有充分的理由，我不得不承认。屏幕上那个可怜的 Shinji 真的表现得好像我还是一个害怕的 14 岁男孩。

"I just want you to answer me one more thing... Shinji."  
"我只想你再回答我一件事... 真嗣。"

That was it. All of those previous words were just the buildup for her to get to the questions that really mattered after all.  
就是这样。之前那些话都只是铺垫，她终究是为了引出那些真正重要的问题。

"At any point... besides serving as a material to satisfy your fantasies or a lifeline that you only sought out when you had no one else available... did I, really, ever mean anything to you? Did I ever do something good for you? Was there at least something good about me that you could genuinely... love?"  
"在任何时候...除了作为满足你幻想的材料或在你无人可依时寻求的救命稻草之外...我，真的，对你有过任何意义吗？我有没有为你做过什么好事？我身上有没有哪怕一点值得你真心...去爱的优点？"

At that moment several images of various memories began to flash across the screen. Each revisited memory became brighter and brighter until it disappeared into thin air in one big, bright flash.  
就在那一刻，各种记忆的画面开始在屏幕上闪现。每段重温的记忆变得越来越亮，直到在一阵耀眼的光芒中消失得无影无踪。

The loving touch on my cheek that I received from Asuka that day at the beach, right after I almost made the biggest mistake of my life. *flash*  
那天在海滩上，我从明日香那里得到的温柔的抚摸，就在我差点犯下一生中最大的错误之后。*闪回*

Hearing her voice over the radio and the feeling of happiness that surged in my chest knowing that she had woken up and was bravely fighting the Eva series. *flash*

The concern in her gaze when we were in the apartment and on the battlefield, to preserve me from the news that Toji was the pilot of Unit-03. *flash*  
在公寓和战场上，她眼中流露出的关切，为了保护我不受得知冬二驾驶三号机消息的影响。*闪回*

The feeling of shame as the whole class looked at us because Toji had called us a "married couple" and how I wanted, for a moment, that to be true. *flash*  
全班因为东治称我们为“夫妻”而齐刷刷地看向我们时，那种羞愧感，以及那一刻我多么希望那是真的。*闪回*

The look of satisfaction I saw on the girl's face when she ate the food I prepared or when we spent our evenings together alone watching television or reading manga. *flash*  
当她吃着我准备的食物，或是我们独处一室共度夜晚，一起看电视或读漫画时，她脸上那满足的表情。*闪回*

The jokes and flirts she would make when we were alone in the apartment, coming home from school or even during synchronization tests. *flash*  
我们在公寓独处时，无论是放学回家还是同步测试期间，她总会开的玩笑和调情。*闪回*

The cute and fumbling way she tried to hide that she was worried about me when I was in the hospital. *flash*  
她在医院里担心我时那种可爱又笨拙的掩饰方式。*闪回*

The applause and compliments she offered me when I finished playing Bach's Cello Suite #1 on the cello. *flash*  
当我用大提琴演奏完巴赫的大提琴组曲第 1 号时，她给予我的掌声和赞美。*闪回*

她为了让我们能和丽一起在一家朴素的餐馆吃拉面，同时让美里省下钱来而精心安排的庆祝活动。*闪回*

The way she, despite her arrogance, revealed herself to be a true leader during the blackout, devising a plan to put herself as a shield to protect Rei and me from the angel's attack. *flash*  
尽管她傲慢，但在停电期间展现出的真正领导力，制定计划将自己作为盾牌，保护丽和我免受天使攻击的那一刻。*闪回*

Her smile and the sweet tone of her words to me after the rescue at the volcano. *flash*  
火山救援后她对我展露的微笑和温柔的语调。*闪回*

The beauty and sensuality of her diving into the pool, which is directly related to the fact that I don't know to this day what the formula for calculating thermal expansion is. *flash*  
她跃入泳池时的美丽与性感，直接关联到我至今仍不知晓热膨胀计算公式的事实。*闪回*

与第九使徒战斗前的同步训练日子，尤其是她……她的火焰……即使在超越丽之后也不放弃，要求我也全力以赴的态度。我想我就是在那天爱上她的。我爱这段记忆。*闪回*

How strange and exciting it was at the same time to pilot Eva-02 together with her. Why is it that. unlike Unit 00, Unit 02 didn't reject me? *flash*  
与她一起驾驶 Eva-02 既奇怪又令人兴奋。为什么，与 00 号机不同，02 号机没有排斥我？*闪回*

How beautiful she looked in her yellow dress on the runway of the Over the Rainbow. The most beautiful girl I've ever seen *flash*  
她在彩虹之上 T 台上的黄色连衣裙是多么美丽。我见过的最美丽的女孩 *闪回*

The sensations I felt when she kissed me and how much I regret to this day that I couldn't hold my breath any longer. *flash*.  
她吻我时的感觉，以及我至今后悔不已的是，我没能屏住呼吸更久。*闪回*.

The look we exchanged before the kiss. Just seeing the scene from this angle, I could tell there was something wrong in her eyes? Her eyes were filled with feelings... I guess... love? Fear? Was she on the verge of crying? *flash*  
接吻前我们交换的眼神。仅仅从这个角度看这个场景，我就能看出她的眼睛里有什么不对劲？她的眼睛充满了感情...我想...是爱？是恐惧？她快要哭了吗？*闪回*

The Shinji on the screen started screaming as the scenario faded around, leaving only an infinite white blank space.  
屏幕上的真嗣开始尖叫，周围的场景逐渐淡去，只剩下一片无尽的空白空间。

"ASUKA! NO! NO! Please, stop it! Oh, fuck! Please!"  
“明日香！不！不！求求你，停下来！哦，该死！求你了！”

"Hyuga! Ibuki! Commander Yadoraki! Anyone? Can you hear me? I want to call it off! You have to stop this!"  
“日向！伊吹！矢多里指挥官！有人吗？能听到我吗？我想取消！你们必须阻止这一切！”

"You're erasing her from me! Just like my father erased the memories of my mother. Just like he must have erased me from her mind! You're erasing Asuka! Right? Please don't do it. I…. I… love her! But I won't when I wake up ... right? I won't know her, so... please, just leave me alone! Please."  
"你正在从我心中抹去她！就像我父亲抹去我母亲记忆中的她一样。就像他一定也从她心中抹去了我一样！你在抹去明日香！对吧？请不要这样做。我……我……爱她！但当我醒来时……就不会了……对吧？我将不再认识她，所以……请让我一个人待着！求你了。"

Once again, he cried in vain, knowing that, on the real world, while he was inside of that entry plug, more fragments of his soul were being stripped into the core of this hybrid Eva.  
又一次，他徒劳地哭泣，明知在现实世界中，当他身处插入栓内时，他的灵魂碎片正被剥离，融入这台混合 EVA 的核心。

But nobody from the outside world could see him cry or hear his screams.  
但外界的任何人，都无法看到他的泪水，也无法听到他的尖叫。

*flash* *闪光*

---

The scenario changed. My counterpart was in Misato's apartment again, looking like I did when I was 14, wearing black pants and a red blouse. Asuka was there too, with her yellow blouse and tiny shorts, staring at him with a curious look.  
场景变换。我的对应者再次出现在美里小姐的公寓里，看起来像我 14 岁时的样子，穿着黑色裤子和红色衬衫。明日香也在那里，穿着她的黄色衬衫和迷你短裤，好奇地盯着他看。

"Baka-Shinji, why are you crying? Men are not supposed to cry. Are you that pathetic?"  
“笨蛋真嗣，你为什么哭？男人不应该哭的。你这么没用吗？”

"Asuka…Shit! They're erasing you."  
“明日香……该死！他们在抹消你。”

"Oh… That makes sense, I think. After all I'm just a train wreck right?" – she got towards her room – "Then I shouldn't be here bothering you."  
"哦……我想这说得通。毕竟我只是个灾难对吧？" – 她走向自己的房间 – "那我就不该在这里打扰你。"

"No, please! We need to stop it, before I wake up and don't know you anymore."  
"不，请别这样！我们得阻止它，不然等我醒来就不认识你了。"

"Okay, well, y'know… just tell them to cancel it then."  
"好吧，嗯，你知道的……就让他们取消吧。"

"I can't cancel it. I'm inside the entry plug and they can't stop it."  
"我无法取消它。我已经进入插入栓了，他们无法阻止。"

She shrugged and went into the living room, sitting on the sofa and started to looking at the TV. Shinji sat next to her and held her hand.  
她耸了耸肩，走进客厅，坐在沙发上开始看电视。真嗣坐在她旁边，握住了她的手。

"Asuka… I'm serious… we have to do something… please…" He couldn't hold on the tears anymore.  
"明日香…我是认真的…我们必须做些什么…求你了…" 他再也控制不住泪水了。"

"Hey, stop crying. I'm not really here. It's not a real memory. I'm just the Asuka in your mind. If you can't ask them to stop, just wake yourself up!"  
"嘿，别哭了。我其实不在这里。这不是真实的记忆。我只是你心中的明日香。如果你无法让他们停止，那就自己醒来吧！"

"I can't…" "我做不到……"

"Shinji, you're always so negative. Just shut up and try! You never try anything. Always running away and giving up so easy."  
"真嗣，你总是这么消极。闭嘴试试看！你从不尝试任何事情。总是逃避和轻易放弃。"

"I don't know how I can do it!" – I blurted angrily. "You did it, too! You erased me first. It's the only reason I'm doing it. WHY? Why did you do that to m…"  
"我不知道我怎么能做到！" – 我愤怒地脱口而出。"你也做了同样的事！你先抹除了我。这是我这么做的唯一原因。为什么？你为什么要那样对我…"

I stopped as I felt her hand caressing my cheek, with a sad look on her face.  
我停了下来，感觉到她的手轻抚我的脸颊，脸上带着悲伤的表情。

"Shinji… I'm sorry. "You know me. I don't mean to hurt you. I'm just… impulsive."  
"真嗣… 对不起。"你知道我。我不是有意伤害你。我只是… 冲动。"

I stared at her for a long time. I knew that this Asuka was not real but, even if it was just the Asuka in my mind, I still needed to try to protect her. To hold on the memories of her. I couldn't let her go.  
我久久地凝视着她。我知道这个明日香并非真实，但即便只是我心中的明日香，我仍需努力保护她。坚守对她的记忆。我不能让她离去。

"I know Asuka. It's one of the things that I love about you."  
“我了解明日香。这也是我爱你的原因之一。”

Misato's apartment started to fade, leaving only both of them in a blank space.  
美里小姐的公寓开始消散，只剩下他们两人置身于一片空白之中。

*flash, flash, flash* *闪光，闪光，闪光*

"I miss… those times when I was alone with you. We had our bunch of errors and successes. I wish I could turn back time."  
"我怀念……那些与你独处的时光。我们有过许多错误和成功。真希望我能回到过去。"

"Hey Shinji." "嘿，真嗣。"

"Yes, Asuka?" "是的，明日香？"

"I'm bored." "我好无聊。"

"W-what do you mean?" "你、你什么意思？"

"Are you stupid? I'm nothing asking for much. But if you can't even do that for me, then what is the point? Just leave me already!"  
"你是不是傻？我也没要求太多。但如果你连这点都做不到，那还有什么意义？干脆让我一个人待着吧！"

"S-sorry…. Please, don't go. I mean… Yes, I will do Asuka. Anything."  
"对-对不起……请，别走。我是说……好的，我会扮演明日香。什么都行。"

The girl looked at him with pleading eyes as her face started to disappear.  
女孩用恳求的眼神看着他，她的脸开始消失。

"So…can you… can you give me… one last kiss?"  
"那么……你能……能给我……最后一个吻吗？"

As Shinji's arms found the way around her, wrapping the girl into a firm embrace, their faces moved on towards each other.  
当真嗣的双臂找到环绕她的方式，将女孩紧紧拥入怀中时，他们的脸庞也向彼此靠近。

*flash* *闪光*

---

The scene changed again. 场景再次变换。

Shinji was back into the cell, looking at the clock. 3:35 AM.  
真嗣回到了牢房，看着时钟。凌晨 3 点 35 分。

"Hey... Shinji?." “嘿...真嗣？”

"Hmm… it's late. Go back to sleep, Asuka. Can we talk tomorrow?"  
"嗯……很晚了。回去睡觉吧，明日香。我们明天再聊好吗？"

I remembered that conversation. It was the last time that I heard her voice.  
我记得那次对话。那是我最后一次听到她的声音。

"I never answered you." "我从未给你答复。"

"What?" "什么？"

"About your question...on the shelter."  
"关于你提到的那个避难所的问题……"

"Oh.. It's... but... you've already said that…"  
"哦……这……但是……你已经说过了……"

"I know what I've said at that time. But I'm gonna give an answer now, for real."  
"我知道我当时说了什么。但现在，我要给出一个真正的答案。"

"Ok."

"Perhaps… If we had had a different meeting. If by chance it were possible to erase everything we live and be reunited again ... being able to start all over again, from scratch ...then… maybe."  
"或许……如果我们能有不同的相遇。如果有可能抹去我们经历的一切，再次重逢……能够从头开始，一切重新来过……那么……或许。"

"Maybe?" "或许？"

"Yes. Maybe… if we had never met before and I saw you in the middle of the street, at school, in a store, or… at a train station or in a train car… I… would try to get your attention."  
"是的。或许……如果我们从未相遇过，而我看到你在街头、在学校、在商店，或者……在火车站或火车车厢里……我……会试图引起你的注意。"

I listened to her, in awe. A strong warmth forming in my chest.  
我聆听着她，心中充满敬畏。一股强烈的暖流在胸中涌动。

"You, being the idiot that you are, probably wouldn't even notice me ... but if you looked at me ... if instead of running away ... you didn't hesitate… if you had the courage to come to me, like that day at the volcano .. . perhaps ..."  
“你，作为你这样的傻瓜，可能甚至不会注意到我……但如果你看着我……如果你没有逃跑……你没有犹豫……如果你有勇气像那天在火山那样来找我……也许……”

"Asuka ... I ...I would certainly notice you."  
“明日香……我……我肯定会注意到你。”

"And?" "然后呢？"

"About the rest ... Yeah ... maybe."  
"关于剩下的... 嗯... 也许吧。"

I guess she always has been right all that time. I am an idiot, after all.  
我想她一直以来都是对的。毕竟，我真是个傻瓜。

"Hey Shinji… can you play it again… so I can sleep?"  
"嘿，真嗣…你能再弹一遍吗…这样我就能睡着了？"

"Ok."

It was almost 4 AM on the clock and Shinji started playing the cello. Bach Suite Number 1. The song that I've played over and over since I got my cello back. Not because nobody had told me to stop, but because she asked me to play it.  
时钟已近凌晨四点，真嗣开始拉奏大提琴。巴赫第一号组曲。自从我重新拿到大提琴后，这首曲子我已反复演奏无数遍。并非因为无人让我停下，而是因为她请求我演奏。

Since the day that she moved to the cell next to mine, this had become a redemption song for us. Usually, she would hum the song or make light taps on the wall to make me sure that she was listening, in some kind of a strange duet.  
自从她搬到我隔壁的牢房那天起，这首曲子便成了我们救赎的象征。通常，她会哼唱旋律或轻轻敲打墙壁，确保我在演奏时她能聆听，仿佛一种奇特的二重奏。

That was not the case that night.  
但那一晚并非如此。

As the song ends, the scenario started to fade.  
随着歌曲的结束，场景开始逐渐消退。

*flash *闪光

---

I opened my eyes and realized that my counterpart at the screen was now on a train station, wearing a formal suit. His hair was cut in a decent way and I think he was even taller now. Like an… adult.  
我睁开眼睛，意识到屏幕上的另一个我此刻正站在火车站，身着正装。他的发型修剪得体，似乎还长高了一些。像个……成年人。

On the other side of the train station's embark platform, there she was. Asuka. She also looked like she had grown up, dressed in some kind like a women's business suit while holding a weird kind of electronic device on her hand. Gorgeous, as always.  
在火车站的另一侧月台上，她就在那里。明日香。她也看起来成熟了许多，身着类似职业女性的套装，手里拿着一个奇怪的电子设备。一如既往地美丽动人。

He approached the border of the platform, not caring for the warning signals and the security protocols, assuming the risk of falling down in the rails. She did the same. But there was no way for them to get closer than that.  
他走近站台边缘，不顾警告信号和安全协议，冒着跌落轨道的风险。她也同样如此。但他们之间，再也无法更近一步了。

"You still thought that you were going to be able to save me this time, didn't you? Even after all that we've been through? Have you learned nothing at all? Forget me, let me go." Asuka said as I noticed that the scenario starts to slowly fade again.  
"你还是以为这次能救得了我，对吧？经历了那么多之后？你一点都没学到吗？忘了我，让我走吧。" 明日香说道，我注意到场景又开始慢慢消退。

"I know, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry." Tears started to drop from his eyes. The sadness also overcome me. Harder than ever. Both in the real and in all those Instrumentality worlds.  
"我知道，对不起。真的很对不起。" 泪水开始从他的眼中滑落。那份悲伤也深深地侵袭了我，比以往任何时候都强烈，无论是在现实还是在那些人类补完计划的世界中。

"Hey. It's okay. You don't need to feel guilty because you're not invincible. Nobody is. Real life is not like fairy tales. Most of the relationships that start during adolescence will crumble because of immaturity. Most people won't marry they first childhood crush. Heck, they won't even marry the person they loved the most. Did you really believe the we, from all people, would be able to defy those odds?"  
"嘿，没事的。你不必因为自己不是无敌的而感到内疚。没有人是。现实生活并不像童话故事。大多数在青春期开始的恋情都会因不成熟而破裂。大多数人不会与他们的初恋结婚。甚至，他们不会与他们最爱的人结婚。你真的以为我们，所有人中，能够打破这些概率吗？"

"It's… it's just not fair. I just… I think we deserved better, you know?"  
"这……这不公平。我只是……我觉得我们值得更好的，你知道吗？"

"Stop being a child. Have you learned nothing at all even after all this time? Come on, everybody knows what you should do. You have to move on. Accept that we are not meant to be together, even if we like each other. Because there are things that we cannot control about our destiny. And it's fine, you're finally free now. Everyone else will look you at you being mature and safe in a new world and be sure that this is the best ending for our story. So, try to find your own way and be happy, ok?"  
"别再像个孩子了。经历了这么多，你一点都没学到吗？来吧，大家都知道你应该怎么做。你必须向前看。接受我们注定不能在一起，即使我们彼此喜欢。因为有些关于我们命运的事情是我们无法控制的。而且这没关系，你现在终于自由了。其他人会看到你在新世界中成熟而安全，并确信这是我们故事最好的结局。所以，试着找到自己的路，快乐起来，好吗？"

She was saying that, but I could see that she was trembling. Once again, she was being strong for both of us, because she needed to do it, since I could do nothing. I'm… scum.  
她虽然这么说，但我看得出她在颤抖。又一次，她为了我们俩坚强起来，因为她必须这么做，而我却无能为力。我……真是人渣。

"Asuka… I… understand but…. I'm selfish and weak… I can't! I can't go on without you. Yeah, maybe I will continue to exist and even be happy but that won't really be living… I won't ever be the same if I forget you."  
“明日香……我……明白，但是……我很自私也很软弱……我做不到！没有你我无法继续前行。是的，也许我会继续存在，甚至感到快乐，但那不是真正的活着……如果我忘了你，我就再也不是原来的我了。”

She turned her face away, hiding a faint blush.  
她转过脸去，掩饰着微微泛起的红晕。

"I.. I will miss you too, stupid. Maybe things could have been different, if we could just give it another go around. Maybe we could have boarded the same train and we would have found each other again. And maybe we would have a chance to start over together, in a world without Evangelions. It would be everything you've ever dreamed, right?"  
"我...我也会想你的，笨蛋。也许一切本可以不同，如果我们能再试一次。也许我们可以登上同一列火车，再次找到彼此。也许我们有机会在一个没有 EVA 的世界里重新开始，那将是你梦寐以求的一切，对吧？"

I could see her starting to fade as the announcer's voice informed that the train was getting closer and that they should step back for security reasons.  
我能看到她开始逐渐消失，广播员的声音提醒说火车即将进站，出于安全考虑，他们应该后退。

"Asuka… It's all returning to nothing. There are no more memories left. I couldn't even say good-bye to you. Please don't leave me. P-please…. I need you."  
"明日香…一切都回归虚无。再也没有记忆留存。我甚至没能向你道别。请不要离开我。求求你…我需要你。"

"Stop crying, baka-Shinji. It's too late for that. Just make up a decent good-bye. Or at least let's pretend we had one."  
"别哭了，笨蛋真嗣。现在哭已经太迟了。编个像样的告别吧。或者至少让我们假装有过一个。"

Asuka raised her hand and waved to me. The train brakes were making a loud noise as the scene was fading, but it didn't matter. I could only hear and see her.  
明日香举起手向我挥别。火车的刹车声震耳欲聋，场景逐渐模糊，但这都不重要。我只能听见和看见她。

"Auf wiedersehen, Shinji." – she said as she was almost fading away.  
"再见，真嗣。"" – 她几乎要消失时说道。

"I love you more than you will ever know!"  
"我爱你胜过你所能知晓的！"

She smiled. 她笑了。

I cried harder. That's what I will miss that the most. Every pain, every doubt and all the negative feelings always seem to go away when she smiles.  
我哭得更厉害了。那正是我最怀念的。每一次痛苦，每一次怀疑，以及所有负面情绪，似乎都在她微笑时烟消云散。

The train finally stopped between them so neither me or the Shinji on the screen could see her face anymore. Some people from her side of the station starts to board into that train.  
列车终于在他们之间停下，无论是我还是屏幕上的真嗣，都无法再看到她的脸。她那边车站的一些人开始登上那列火车。

The train departed and I can see there is nobody else in the other side. Now I can't even remember her face. And I know I would not ever remember it again.  
列车驶离，我看到对面空无一人。现在我甚至记不清她的脸了。我知道我再也不会记得它了。

Then everything faded into nothingness.  
然后一切都消逝在虚无之中。

Now, the conclusion. 现在，结论来了。

---
Asuka and Shinji slowly opened their eyes, still embracing each other, but took a moment to realize that they weren't inside of the train wagon anymore.  
明日香和真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛，依旧紧紧相拥，但过了一会儿才意识到他们已经不在列车车厢里了。

Their bare feet were being moisten by the soft and calm waves of the blue ocean. They were in a place that looked like a deserted beach. A beach in which they had been before, when they met for the first time after the…  
他们的赤脚被蓝色海洋柔和平静的波浪浸湿。他们身处一个看似荒废的海滩。这个海滩，正是他们第一次重逢的地方，就在那次事件之后……

Realization of what just had happened hit them both, as they quickly disentangled themselves from the embrace they were in, while also taking several steps backwards, in obvious embarrassment.  
意识到刚刚发生了什么，他们迅速从拥抱中解脱出来，同时明显尴尬地向后退了几步。

They stared at each other, like it was the first time that they've ever met.  
他们彼此凝视，仿佛这是他们第一次相遇。

The ponytailed boy was wearing a white shirt and black pants, with the water from the sea covering everything bellow his shin. He had grown up from his younger self, being now almost a full head taller than the girl that was staring at him.  
扎着马尾的男孩穿着白衬衫和黑裤子，海水浸湿了他小腿以下的部分。他已经从年少时成长起来，现在几乎比凝视着他的女孩高出一个头。

Said girl was wearing a yellow sundress that was just on the verge of getting wet by the waves, with distinguished red hair ribbons on her braided hair. Her beauty was only partially impaired by some faint scar's marks on her left eye.  
那位少女身着一件黄色太阳裙，裙摆正处在被海浪打湿的边缘，她编起的头发上系着醒目的红色发带。她左眼上的几道淡淡疤痕略微影响了她的美丽。

"Shinji… is that really you?" "Asuka, you're real"? – the two teenagers asked each other at the same time, which made them blush and added another layer to their embarrassment.  
“真嗣…真的是你吗？”“明日香，你也是真的吗？”——两个少年同时问道，这让他们的脸颊泛起红晕，更加深了彼此的尴尬。

After a few moments, Shinji was the first to resume talking.  
片刻之后，真嗣率先开口打破了沉默。

"Asuka, do you remember me? Do you remember … everything?  
"明日香，你还记得我吗？你还记得……所有的一切吗？"

"Of course, thir… Shinji. It seems like… we have been piloting the Evas again and then we were inside that train…"  
"当然，这……真嗣。好像……我们又在驾驶 Eva，然后我们就在那列火车里……"

"What just happened now… it was strange… it was different from instrumentality."  
"刚才发生了什么……这很奇怪……和融合不同。"

"Yeah. And it was different from the time when that angel invaded my mind too. It was more like… going into a stroll through my dreams. Kinda like seeing your life in movie and being able to have an insider's look about some" – she hesitated – "i-important memories."  
"是啊。和那次天使入侵我心灵的感觉也不一样。更像是……在梦境中漫步。有点像看你的人生电影，并且能够深入了解一些" – 她犹豫了一下 – "重-重要的记忆。"

"Y-yes… I think the same thing happened to me."  
"嗯-嗯……我觉得我也经历了同样的事情。"

"It was… weird to see all those memories at once, in a way that puts everything in perspective and… wait, are you crying?"  
"那感觉……很奇怪，一下子看到所有这些记忆，以一种让人豁然开朗的方式……等等，你在哭吗？"

The boy suddenly closed the gap between them and pulled the girl into a strong embrace, burying his crying face on her shoulder.  
男孩突然缩短了他们之间的距离，将女孩紧紧拥入怀中，把哭泣的脸埋在她的肩上。

He was not acting by impulse. He knew that it was a bold move. One that could easily backfire. Badly. But he didn't care. Asuka was there in front of him. The real Asuka. The one that he thought that he had lost forever. He had only one certainty in his mind: no matter what happens, he wouldn't run away this time.  
他并非一时冲动。他知道这是一个大胆的举动，很容易适得其反，后果严重。但他不在乎。明日香就在他面前，真实的明日香，那个他以为永远失去的明日香。他心中只有一个坚定的信念：无论发生什么，这次他不会再逃避。

"H-hey what are you doing? We have a deal. You are still not allowed to touch me and…." – Asuka suddenly stopped talking and realized that she was scolding the boy solely by reflex.  
“嘿，你在干什么？我们有约定的。你还不可以碰我，而且……”——明日香突然停了下来，意识到她只是在条件反射地责备这个男孩。

But, in fact, the last thing that she would want at that moment was to get away from that embrace. An embrace that she longed for such a long time and she needed so much when she was younger. 重试    错误原因

The feeling of his touch, holding her, was… warm. Warmth. A sensation that she already had forgotten. His presence… being this close to him… was making her feel good… in fact, it was one of the best sensations that she felt in her entire life. 重试    错误原因

She felt safe. And glad. Even with his hardened façade and weird ponytail, and the fact that he was now taller than her, she could feel that nothing changed at all. He was the same boy that she met at the Over the Rainbow. The one that she learned to love and hate. The idiot that since that day was always on her mind, all of the time. And how she missed that. To be able to think about him. 重试    错误原因

The sudden new rush and mix of complicated feelings made the girl awkwardly return the embrace, putting up an arm over the boy's shoulder while gently caressing his hair with her other hand, without realizing that some tears were already falling from her own eyes as well.  
突如其来的新冲动和复杂的情感交织，让女孩尴尬地回抱了对方，一只手臂搭在男孩的肩上，另一只手则温柔地抚摸着他的头发，却未意识到自己眼中也已悄然滑落泪珠。

"Baka…. Look at you. You've grown up, but you still are just a crybaby, aren't you?"  
“笨蛋……看看你。长大了，却还是个爱哭鬼，对吧？”

"Asuka… I… thought that I'd lost you forever. Like, really lost you. All about you. It was even worse than being kept apart from you or knowing that you didn't want to see me ever again. They messed with my head. They made me forget. It hurt so much! I thought that I had lost everything. Oh, God. Asuka, I lo…"  
“明日香……我……以为我永远失去了你。真的，彻底失去了关于你的一切。这比被分开或知道你再也不想见我还要糟糕。他们扰乱了我的思绪。他们让我遗忘。那种痛苦难以言表！我以为我失去了所有。哦，天哪。明日香，我……”

"Shhh…. I know! I know… it's ok. Its ok."  
"嘘…我知道！我知道…没事的。没事的。"

They kept the embrace for a while, feeling something like a proximity... to elation? To happiness? What were those feelings? However, the peaceful moment soon started to become a little bit awkward for them, so Asuka broke the silence.  
他们就这样拥抱了一会儿，感受到一种近似于…喜悦？幸福？那些感觉是什么？然而，这平静的时刻不久便开始变得有些尴尬，于是明日香打破了沉默。

"Well... I think that, at least, you've found your answer, right?  
"嗯…我想至少，你已经找到答案了，对吧？"

"Yes… oh… sorry. What answer, you mean?"  
"是的……哦……抱歉。你指的是什么答案？"

"About what could've happened if we had a different meeting. I mean, if that was really you there."  
"关于如果我们有不同的相遇会发生什么。我是说，如果那真的是你在那里。"

"Oh…" – he blushed as he remembered what they were doing at that train, that was probably another representation of the odd reality created by the core of this Evangelion – "yes… I think that…. No, I know that it was real! Even if we were dreaming and didn't have our memories, it was true. Everything we did there was true and I know it because…. I could feel you! The real you."  
"哦……"" – 他脸红了，想起了他们在那列火车上做的事情，那很可能是由这部《新世纪福音战士》核心创造的奇异现实的另一种表现 – ""是的……我想那……不，我知道那是真实的！即使我们在梦中没有记忆，那也是真实的。我们在那里所做的一切都是真实的，我知道这一点是因为……我能感受到你！真实的你。"

It was the girl's turn to blush and use that opportunity to gently get away from the embrace - "Yeah, I know…. And I know exactly _what_ you were feeling, or should I say, what you were tasting, right you pervert?" – she said with a serious voice as the boy waved his arms in front of himself, in obvious embarrassment - "I can't believe in it! Even when having unlikely second chances, you never change. Once again you only had the courage to kiss me when I had my eyes closed, didn't you? I think you may have a kink for those kinds of perverted fantasies."  
轮到女孩脸红了，她趁机轻轻挣脱怀抱——“是啊，我知道……而且我清楚你当时在感受什么，或者我该说，你在品尝什么，对吧，你这个变态？”——她用严肃的语气说道，男孩则尴尬地在自己面前挥舞着手臂——“我简直不敢相信！即使有了不可能的第二次机会，你还是一点都没变。又一次，你只敢在我闭眼时吻我，对吧？我觉得你可能对那种变态幻想有特殊的癖好。”

"Hey! It was not like that. You were the one who proposed that bet and…" – he said in a defensive and annoyed way, which propelled Asuka to display a confident smirk on her face and interrupt him with a flick on his forehead.  
“嘿！不是那样的。是你提议打那个赌的，而且……”——他带着防御和恼怒的语气说道，这让明日香脸上露出了自信的微笑，她用手指轻弹了一下他的额头，打断了他。

"He… you're still such a boring little boy. Guess that some things never change. That's good."  
“他……你还是这么个无趣的小男孩。看来有些事情永远不会改变。这样挺好。”

Shinji's annoyed face immediately gave place to a relieved one as he almost smiled while he looked at the nonchalant confident victory pose that the girl was making.  
真嗣那恼怒的表情立刻转变为释然，他几乎要笑出来，看着女孩那满不在乎的自信胜利姿态。

For a moment, it felt like nothing had changed at all and they were just children again. Like in those happiest moments of their old lives. But soon he realized that this small and much anticipated moment of happiness was not meant to last.  
有那么一刻，仿佛一切都未曾改变，他们还是孩子。就像那些旧日生活中最快乐的时光。但很快他就意识到，这个小小且期待已久的幸福时刻并不意味着持久。

"Asuka... we are in trouble."  
“明日香...我们有麻烦了。”

She stopped smirking and looked at him with a more serious face, willing to listen to what he was going to say.  
她收起了那副戏谑的笑容，换上一副更为严肃的面孔，准备倾听他即将说出的话。

"I…remember this sensation. We are stuck. Within the core of the Evangelion. It's the same thing that happened to me that time."  
“我……记得这种感觉。我们被困住了。在 EVA 的核心之中。这与我那次经历的情况如出一辙。”

Asuka clenched her fists in anger.  
明日香紧握双拳，怒火中烧。

"I see. I understand now. That explains everything...that procedure... how they were able to make us able to pilot the Eva again... they did to us exactly the same thing that they did to mama! Pieces of our souls and memories become entrapped here and, in the real world, we…we.." – the girl clenched both fists and starts to tremble in anger  
"我明白了。现在我懂了。这一切都解释得通了……那个程序……他们是如何让我们再次驾驶 Eva 的……他们对我们做了和妈妈一样的事情！我们的灵魂碎片和记忆被困在这里，而在现实世界中，我们……我们……" – 女孩紧握双拳，愤怒地颤抖着

Shinji looked at her as the girl continue to realize the situation, filling her voice with pure rage.  
真嗣看着她，女孩继续意识到这一情况，声音中充满了纯粹的愤怒。

"Damn... bastards... they no longer had our mothers' souls inside, so they separated parts of our own souls to put them into the Evangelions' core so we could pilot them again. _Gott_, how could I have missed that? How was I such an idiot? Shinji, they made us…." – she stopped as realization hit her. They were fighting each other. In a deathmatch.  
"该死……混蛋……他们不再拥有我们母亲的灵魂，所以他们分离了我们自己的灵魂碎片，放入 Eva 的核心，以便我们能再次驾驶它们。天哪，我怎么会没注意到？我怎么会这么蠢？真嗣，他们让我们……" – 她停了下来，意识到他们正在互相残杀。在一场生死对决中。

She looked at the boy, who offered a sad smile in return. Just like he always feared, they had been forced to fight against each other. And they only were there now, talking to each other, because some kind of miracle.  
她看着那个男孩，他回以一个悲伤的微笑。正如他一直担心的那样，他们被迫相互对抗。而现在，他们能在这里交谈，全因某种奇迹。

"Yes… but that's not all. I can't hear or sense anything of the outside world. I think we are floating on some kind of void. It feels like that time…."  
“是的……但不仅如此。我听不到也感知不到外界的任何事物。我觉得我们漂浮在某种虚无之中。感觉就像那次……”

"When you were trapped by that shadow angel?" – she completed.  
“当你被那个影子天使困住的时候？”——她补充道。

"Yes. But not only this. It's also something alike the time when I was trapped inside Unit 01. I think that…we are probably trapped twice. Inside the core of your Evangelion, which is also inside this odd dimension."  
"是的。但不仅仅是这样。这感觉像是我在初号机里被困住的时候。我想……我们可能被困了两次。在你的 EVA 核心里，同时也在这个奇怪的维度里。"

"Ha…. that's precious. It's like those old angelic days huh, third? I would rather have to deal with a little angel than to face this kind of trouble. Well… at least we know what happened and we can try to figure things out."  
"哈……真是珍贵。就像那些旧时的天使日子，对吧，三号？我宁愿对付一个小天使，也不愿面对这种麻烦。好吧……至少我们知道发生了什么，可以试着弄清楚。"

Asuka put her hand on her shin and started to think hard. Shinji didn't dare to interrupt her.  
明日香把手放在她的腿上，开始认真思考。真嗣不敢打断她。

"Well, it seems like we are in a very bad situation, isn't it? Fortunately, I think that I remembered some of their conversations. If my reasoning and memories are correct, this Eva unit has a functional S2 engine now after I've…. absorbed your Eva's core. That was the whole point of those bastards' masterplan that resulted in making us fight against each other. And that explain what happened after I…"  
"嗯，看来我们陷入了非常糟糕的境地，不是吗？幸运的是，我想起了他们的一些对话。如果我的推理和记忆无误，这台 Eva 单位在我……吸收了你的 Eva 核心后，现在拥有了一个功能性的 S2 引擎。这就是那些混蛋整个阴谋的核心，导致我们互相争斗。这也解释了在我……之后发生的事情。"

"That makes sense. I think you nailed it, Asuka." – Shinji said with a warm smile staring at the girl who was in 'full pilot mode' right now.  
"说得通。我想你抓住了要点，明日香。" – 真嗣带着温暖的微笑看着此刻处于'完全驾驶员模式'的女孩。"

"But at least our situation this time is better than before. This perfected S2 engine can provide us with infinite life support for an unlimited amount of time, so we can take our time and try to find a way to make this Evangelion move and tear apart this space in this Dirac Sea." – the girl said with conviction – "Also, because both of us are having this conversation here, it means that we have enough consciousness to be able to regain our physical forms. So, once we can focus on take control of the Eva again, we will be able to return to our universe and they will have to find a way to retrieve our bodies from this core. They have already done it before."  
"但至少这次我们的处境比之前要好。这个完善的 S2 引擎能为我们提供无限的生命支持，时间无限，所以我们可以慢慢来，设法让这台 EVA 动起来，撕裂这片狄拉克海的虚空。" – 女孩坚定地说 – "而且，既然我们能在这里进行对话，就意味着我们有足够的意识来恢复我们的实体形态。所以，一旦我们能重新掌控 EVA，我们就能回到我们的宇宙，他们也得想办法从核心中找回我们的身体。他们以前已经做过一次了。"

The boy looked at her in awe. Her reasoning was almost flawless - "You're truly amazing, Asuka. But sadly… I don't think that we will have that much time" – Shinji said with a sad voice.  
男孩敬畏地看着她。她的推理几乎无懈可击——"你真的很了不起，明日香。但遗憾的是……我觉得我们没有那么多时间" – 真嗣带着悲伤的声音说道。

"Huh…. What are you saying?" – she said, mildly annoyed at the fact that he was somehow questioning her thesis but, after staring at him for a few moments, she realized what the boy was trying to say. - "Oh… you mean…."  
"嗯……你在说什么呢？" – 她有些不悦，因为他似乎在质疑她的论点，但盯着他看了一会儿后，她明白了男孩的意思。– "哦……你是说……"

"If we try to activate it right now won't happen like when I was absorbed by the Angel and put my Eva in life support mode. What probably will happen is something like… the incident with Unit 04, in Nevada."  
“如果我们现在尝试激活它，不会像我被使徒吸收并让我的 Eva 进入生命维持模式那样。可能发生的情况更像是……内华达州 04 号机的那次事件。”

It took Asuka another few seconds until she realized the full extension of the problem. The mere contact of her Evangelion core with its missing parts that were attached to the Jet Alone opened a rift.  
阿斯卡又花了好几秒钟才完全意识到问题的严重性。她的 Eva 核心与 Jet Alone 上缺失部分的接触，打开了一个裂隙。

Therefore, without the proper control by a conscious and experienced pilot or a dummy system, the raw energy of the artificial S2 engine would create a small black hole that, in turn, would attract everything within a bunch of square kilometers-ratio into this pocket dimension, making all return to nothing and vanish forever.  
因此，在没有经验丰富的驾驶员或模拟系统的正确控制下，人造 S2 引擎的原始能量会形成一个小型黑洞，进而将周围数平方公里内的一切吸入这个口袋维度，使其化为乌有，永远消失。

And since the battery power of her Evangelion was already burned out, it was just a matter of time until its berserk state would allow them to try to do something to get out of there.  
由于她的 EVA 电池能量已经耗尽，它陷入狂暴状态只是时间问题，他们必须设法尽快逃离这里。

"And so, what?" – the girl said with an irritated and not so confident voice – "Let's activate it and deal with the consequences! I don't care about that kind of collateral damage it will cause. Those people out there just manipulated and used us as tools for their personal desires. I bet that a bunch of them would be happy if we disappeared. I know for sure that a lot of people would celebrate if I died or vanished from this world forever. And in just a few years the world will forget about us and everything we have done."  
"那又怎样？" 女孩带着烦躁且不自信的语气说道，"我们启动它，然后面对后果吧！我才不在乎它会造成的附带损害。外面那些人只是把我们当作满足私欲的工具。我敢打赌，如果我们就此消失，很多人会拍手称快。我确信，如果我从这个世界上死去或消失，会有很多人欢呼雀跃。再过几年，世界就会忘记我们和我们所做的一切。"

"That's not true, Asuka!" – the boy responded, rather firmly – "Yes, I know that some people can be mean. Some of them did horrible things and said nasty things about us. But I also know that many people out there care for us" or, at least, are rooting for us. And as long as there are some people like that outside, we must make an effort."  
"不是这样的，明日香！" 男孩坚定地回应，"我知道有些人很刻薄，他们做了可怕的事，说了难听的话。但我也知道，有很多人关心我们"或者至少支持我们。只要外面还有这样的人，我们就必须努力。"

Asuka stared at the boy, not willing to admit that he had a point. She suddenly remembered that not only in the past few months, but during all her life, there were people that cared for her, even if they were mostly focused in their own personal struggles. But still, it was not their fault. They weren't in an easy situation. This was war. And they did the best, under their circumstances. But, of course, nobody tried harder than the boy who was standing in front of her.  
明日香盯着那个男孩，不愿承认他说的有道理。她突然想起，不仅在过去几个月里，而是她一生中，都有人关心她，即使他们大多专注于自己的个人挣扎。但即便如此，这并不是他们的错。他们的处境并不容易。这是战争。他们在自己的条件下尽了最大努力。当然，没有人比站在她面前的这个男孩更努力了。

"Always the damn martyr, aren't you, third? Whatever. I won't do things just to save them. Our safety comes first. Now, the best we can do is try to figure out how to make this damn robot move without killing ourselves."  
“总是当那个该死的殉道者，对吧，三号？随便了。我不会为了救他们而做事。我们的安全第一。现在，我们能做的最好的事情就是想办法让这个该死的机器人动起来而不至于害死自己。”

Shinji looked at the girl who was thinking hard about the problem. She had always been beautiful. However, the way her braided red hair fought gently against the pleasant summer breeze, the way her sundress fit her almost adult body and the beautiful scenery in the background, with the blue sky and the blue sea, was simply stunning. A perfect picture that he wanted to keep on his mind forever.  
真嗣看着那个正在认真思考问题的女孩。她一直都很美丽。然而，她编成辫子的红发在宜人的夏风中轻柔地飘动，她的太阳裙恰到好处地贴合着她几乎成熟的身躯，以及背景中蔚蓝的天空和碧蓝的大海，这一切简直令人惊叹。这是一幅他想永远铭记在心的完美画面。

But that wasn't what was making him blush and feel warm inside. It was something else, something that most people missed about her. The thing about her that he loved the most. Her intense fire and determination in her eyes, that reminded him of that moment when he met her, right after Hikari told him to go after her during they synch training.  
但这并非令他脸红心跳、内心温暖的原因。还有别的东西，大多数人未曾注意到她的这一点。他最爱的，是她眼中的炽热与坚定，让他回想起与她相遇的那一刻，就在光告诉他去追她之后，他们在同步训练中。

She won't give up trying. She would always try everything and do her best to live and achieve victory. She is a person that, even if she is scared and afraid. would never surrender or give up unless she…. no, he wouldn't allow that to happen. Never again.  
她不会放弃尝试。她总是竭尽全力去生活、去争取胜利。即使恐惧害怕，她也绝不投降或放弃，除非她……不，他绝不允许那样的事再次发生。绝不。

He kept staring at her for a while, until his face softened, as he made his decision.  
他凝视了她许久，直到神情柔和，做出了决定。

"Hey, Asuka." “嘿，明日香。”

"What!?" – she responded in a harsh way, annoyed by being interrupted in her thoughts and by the fact that she wasn't able to think about a possible solution to solve the impossible scenario.  
"什么！？" – 她以严厉的语气回应，因被打断思绪和无法想出解决这不可能情境的办法而感到恼火。

"Before we advance, I just want you to know something."  
"在我们前进之前，我只想让你知道一件事。"

"Oh! The invincible Shinji Ikari still has more secrets to share? What are you, stupid?! If it's something useful spit it out already."  
"哦！无敌的碇真嗣还有更多秘密要分享？你是不是傻啊？！如果是有用的东西就快说出来。"

"I…. just want you and that… I'm really glad that, at least, I was able to see you again. Goodbye, Asuka." – the girl's eyes widened, in surprise as he suddenly grappled her by her shoulders and, in one swift movement, pushed her down towards the water.  
"我……只是想要你，还有那……我真的很高兴，至少，我还能再次见到你。再见，明日香。" – 女孩的眼睛因惊讶而睁大，他突然抓住她的肩膀，以一个迅速的动作，将她推向水面。

As she was falling toward the water, time apparently began to pass in slow motion.  
当她向水面坠落时，时间似乎开始以慢动作流逝。

"Shinji... why?" "真嗣……为什么？"

"My mother told me that humans can only live on this planet, but Evangelion can live forever... together with the human soul that dwells within it."  
"我母亲曾告诉我，人类只能在这颗星球上生存，但福音战士却能永生...与寄宿其中的灵魂一同。"

"What the heck you are talking about? Are you insane?"  
"你到底在说什么鬼话？你疯了吗？"

"That's why neither myself or my father were able to stay with her at the end. An Evangelion can only support one human soul in its core. If there is more than one soul inside it, a clash of wills and egos will begin, like it was during instrumentality. And, because of this, the Evangelion will become inert and its core would collapse, unless one of those souls is expelled into the outside world. Also, if that doesn't happen… the souls would be trapped into a perpetual struggle where either one of them will eventually devour the other or they both will lose their AT-Fields and become merged forever into a single being devoid of any individuality."  
"这就是为什么我和我父亲最终都无法与她在一起。福音战士的核心只能容纳一个人类的灵魂。如果其中存在多个灵魂，意志与自我之间的冲突就会开始，就像在人类补完计划期间那样。而且，正因为如此，福音战士会变得无动于衷，其核心也将崩溃，除非其中一个灵魂被驱逐到外界。此外，如果不发生这种情况...灵魂们将陷入永恒的斗争，要么一方吞噬另一方，要么两者都失去 AT 力场，永远融合成一个没有个性的单一存在。"

"Wait! You meant that what are you doing is…"  
“等等！你的意思是你在做的事情是……”

"It's the only way Asuka. And you won the fight. So, it's the fair outcome. I couldn't be Earth's savior or hero. But you can be. You need to survive and find your rightful place as the only Evangelion pilot who will rebuild this world that I've destroyed and failed several times. I will stay here into the core and I will make this Eva rip apart this pocket dimension. And after that I will always be there to protect and fight for you until I'm not needed anymore."  
“这是唯一的办法，明日香。而且你赢得了战斗，这是公平的结果。我无法成为地球的救世主或英雄，但你可以。你需要活下去，找到你作为唯一能重建这个被我多次毁灭和失败的世界的 EVA 驾驶员的真正位置。我会留在这里的核心，让这台 EVA 撕裂这个口袋维度。之后，我会一直在那里保护你、为你而战，直到我不再被需要。”

Asuka could only give the boy a scared and heartbroken look as she saw his sad smile.  
明日香只能给这个男孩一个惊恐而心碎的表情，她看到了他悲伤的微笑。

"Goodbye, Asuka. Please, be safe. You deserve to live… and I… I… I hope that, as we move on towards different paths, you will be able to finally find the happiness that you deserve."  
"再见，明日香。请务必保重。你值得活下去……而我……我……我希望，当我们各自踏上不同的道路时，你能最终找到你应得的幸福。"

As she started to feel the water wetting her hair, the image of the boy in front of her began to blur.  
当她开始感觉到水浸湿了她的头发，眼前男孩的影像逐渐变得模糊。

Real world battle sounds and the feeling of being back at the entry plug of her zombie Unit 02 started to get stronger and stronger.  
现实世界的战斗声响和重新回到她的僵尸二号机插入栓的感觉变得越来越强烈。

She had won. 她赢了。

At the end of the world, in the last Eva battle, she was the one standing victorious.  
在世界尽头，在最后的 Eva 战斗中，她是那个屹立不倒的胜利者。

And no matter how many people would try to control her, she was now the most important and powerful person in the world.  
无论多少人试图控制她，如今她已成为世界上最重要、最强大的人。

The only pilot of an Evangelion unit, one that is equipped with a functional S2 engine. A weapon, but also a tool, that has enough energy to rebuild the world after the Third Impact.  
唯一驾驶着配备有功能性 S2 引擎的 EVA 机体的驾驶员。它既是一件武器，也是一件工具，拥有足以在第三次冲击后重建世界的能量。

An invaluable asset for the future of humanity.  
对人类未来而言，这是一份无价之宝。

With that kind of power, the world would be restored into a normal place again in a short time.  
凭借这种力量，世界将在短时间内恢复正常。

And, finally, Asuka Langley Sohryu would be able fulfill all of her dreams.  
最终，明日香·兰格雷将能实现她所有的梦想。

But… what about stupid Shinji? His absence… it… makes it all seems… Empty? Unreal?  
但是……那个笨蛋真嗣呢？他的缺席……让这一切显得……空洞？不真实？

But that's fair, isn't it? After all, that was the choice that he made. It was his call. The way that he wanted things to happen.  
但这很公平，不是吗？毕竟，那是他自己的选择。是他自己的决定。他希望事情这样发展。

He chose to sacrifice himself to give her a new chance to start over, in a world where she will be able to achieve everything she had always dreamed of. A future that which could happen. Or not.  
他选择牺牲自己，给她一个重新开始的机会，在一个她能够实现所有梦想的世界里。一个可能发生的未来。也可能不会。

_"I don't want…" “我不想……”_

Sure. Things won't ever be the same without him. But the truth is: there is no point thinking about "what if" scenarios. Not now, not ever.  
当然。没有他，一切都不会再一样。但事实是：现在乃至永远，纠结于“如果”的假设场景毫无意义。

And, in one way or another, he would still be with her. Along with her memories of him. Even if the price to pay is the fact that he will spend the rest of his existence trapped inside Eva.  
无论如何，他依然会以某种方式陪伴在她身边。伴随着她对他的记忆。即便代价是他将永远被困在 Eva 之中。

Yes. That's right. The boy made a sacrifice for giving her the chance of keeping living. Just like Ayanami, Kaji and Misato did. This is the expected outcome of war. And, as his former companion, she won't complain or mop about it, but she will honor his resolve and go on without looking back. He deserves that, at least.  
是的，没错。男孩为了给她继续生活的机会做出了牺牲。就像绫波、加持和美里所做的那样。这是战争的必然结果。作为他曾经的同伴，她不会抱怨或沉溺其中，而是会尊重他的决心，继续前行，不再回头。至少，他值得这样的对待。

She won't need to abandon Eva. She will be praised, be recognized worldwide and loved by everyone in this planet as she will be the one who will work hard to rebuild it. To undo all of Shinji's and Nerv's mistakes.  
她不需要放弃 Eva。她将受到赞誉，被全世界认可，并受到地球上每个人的爱戴，因为她将是那个努力重建世界的人。去纠正真嗣和 NERV 所犯下的所有错误。

And now, with her fully restored soul, she will also have the opportunity to have a normal life again. Sure, her childhood was taken away from her and it won't return.  
如今，随着她的灵魂完全恢复，她也将有机会再次拥有正常的生活。当然，她的童年已被夺走，无法挽回。

But she will be able to taste food again. To sleep well. To allow herself to be beautiful again. And maybe, when time heals those scars and the world becomes a better place, she would be able to live the rest of her girlhood years.  
但她将能再次品尝食物的美味。能够安然入睡。能够再次让自己变得美丽。也许，当时间抚平那些伤痕，世界变得更加美好时，她能够度过余下的少女时光。

Also, she will have everything money can buy in this new world, in her new position. Maybe she would be able use that resources to meet Hikari and other persons of her previous life. She will be able to restore those old bonds and also build new ones.  
此外，在这个新世界，以她的新身份，她将拥有金钱能买到的一切。也许她可以利用这些资源去见光和其他前世的人。她将能够修复那些旧日的纽带，并建立新的联系。

After that, she will grow up and become an adult. And maybe even… love someone else? After all, she was still young and probably would have some decades ahead of pain of losing her first love will be buried – just like the pain of losing her Mama and Kaji will be – and she will learn to enjoy the world and also the company of common and ordinary people.  
在那之后，她会长大成人。甚至可能……爱上别人？毕竟，她还年轻，或许还有几十年的时间，失去初恋的痛苦终将被埋藏——就像失去妈妈和加持的痛苦一样——她将学会享受这个世界，以及普通人的陪伴。

_"I don't want…" “我不想……”_

Maybe she could have tried it before, with the cute guy that Hikari made her go with on that blind date. Why didn't she give that guy a chance? She always sabotaged herself, trying to chase impossible relationships and goals, and that's why she wasn't able to just enjoy life and pursuit real happiness.  
或许她本可以早点尝试，和光让她去的那次相亲中的那个可爱男孩。为什么她不给那个男孩一个机会呢？她总是自我破坏，试图追逐不可能的关系和目标，这就是为什么她无法享受生活，追求真正的幸福。

But those days are over. She won't be depressed anymore. She doesn't have anything to prove, to herself and to anyone. So, she will be able to allow herself to meet new people and fall in love again. To do all those dumb romantic things that couples do. Allow herself to be swept off of her feet by some great guy and live those moments with passion. Give all of herself without any regrets or guilty.  
但那些日子已经结束了。她不会再陷入抑郁。她没有什么需要向自己或任何人证明的。因此，她将能够允许自己结识新朋友并再次坠入爱河。去做那些情侣们做的傻乎乎的浪漫事情。让某个出色的男人将她深深打动，充满激情地度过那些时刻。毫无遗憾或愧疚地付出自己的全部。

_"I don't want…" “我不想……”_

And eventually she will be able to form a healthy relationship, with a worthy man that will love and support her. One that will not need her as an emotional crutch and that will be able to make her happy instead of cause her constant pain.  
最终，她将能够与一个值得的男人建立健康的关系，他会爱她、支持她。一个不需要她作为情感支柱，而是能让她快乐而不是不断给她带来痛苦的人。

So, maybe she will get married and… start a family?  
所以，也许她会结婚并……组建一个家庭？

She never thought about it before, but now the images are clear in her mind., after living a glorious youth and cementing her place in history as earth greatest Evangelion pilot and the savior of mankind, she would settle in a nice house and live some comfortable and quiet days with her partner and her children.  
她以前从未想过这些，但现在这些画面清晰地浮现在她的脑海中。在度过了一段辉煌的青春岁月，并作为地球上最伟大的 EVA 驾驶员和人类的救世主在历史上留下了自己的位置之后，她会在一所舒适的房子里安定下来，与伴侣和孩子们一起度过一些平静而宁静的日子。

And, after some really peaceful and well lived decades, she would relive those days with her grandchildren.  
然后，在经历了几十年真正平静而充实的生活之后，她会与孙辈们一起重温那些时光。

_"I don't want to…" “我不想……”_

Until it comes the day when she will finally leave this world.  
直到她终将离开这个世界的那一天来临。

On that day she will be laying in a nice and comfortable bed, surrounded by the family that she built and with lots of people who loved her.  
那一天，她将安卧在舒适宜人的床上，被她所建立的家庭环绕，身边满是深爱她的人们。

She will also be able to watch on the screen how important she is, by seeing the commotion and the respect of the rebuild human society who will always be grateful for everything that she had done for the world.  
她还能通过屏幕看到自己有多么重要，见证重建后的人类社会对她的敬意和骚动，他们将永远感激她为世界所做的一切。

But still… she could see that in her _'momento mori'_ she will have an odd final thought crossing on her mind.  
但即便如此……她能预见到，在她生命的最后一刻，脑海中会掠过一个奇怪的念头。

About a young boy gently offering her a bento box, with a kind smile.  
关于一个少年温柔地递给她一个便当盒，带着和善的微笑。

Who was this boy? 这个男孩是谁？

His face… those feelings…. They are something that.  
他的脸……那些情感……它们是某种东西。

**_"I DON'T WANT TO FORGET"  
“我不想忘记”_**

So, this is it. After all that time, finally this story has a conclusion.  
所以，就是这样了。经历了那么长时间，这个故事终于迎来了结局。

It's a true bittersweet resolution, but really there could be no other way that Shinji and Asuka's story could end. After all, even if they are soulmates, in all of the possible worlds and universes, they would always meet each other and fall in love, but would never be able to really be together.  
这是一个真正的苦乐参半的结局，但实际上，碇真嗣和明日香的故事只能以这种方式结束。毕竟，即使他们是灵魂伴侣，在所有可能的世界和宇宙中，他们总会相遇并坠入爱河，但永远无法真正在一起。

But Shinji was wrong in his thoughts.  
但真嗣的想法是错误的。

When Asuka's face was about to be completely covered by water, the girl quickly used her left hand to grab Shinji's arm and pull him hard towards her.  
当明日香的脸即将完全被水淹没时，她迅速用左手抓住真嗣的手臂，用力将他拉向自己。

As a result, the two teenagers went down, falling into the shallow ocean, soiling their bodies and faces with the salt water and the wet sand.  
结果，两个少年一起跌入了浅海，身体和脸上沾满了咸水和湿沙。

"Asuka (gasp), what are you doing? Stop it." - Shinji said as he managed to sit down and look at the girl. Only to fell a hard punch being delivered in the right side of his face. And then another one, on the top of his head. And another.  
“明日香（喘气），你在干什么？停下来。”——真嗣一边说着，一边设法坐下来看着女孩。却突然感到右脸颊被重重地打了一拳。接着又是一拳，打在了头顶。还有一拳。

Until a strong wave came and caused them to be wiped out by it and been trapped beneath the water for several seconds. The color of the sea began to change into a vivid red, with a strong smell of blood, as rain clouds begin to form.  
直到一股强劲的波浪袭来，将他们卷入其中，被困在水下数秒。海水的颜色开始变成鲜红色，伴随着浓烈的血腥味，乌云也开始聚集。

Shinji tried to get up and catch his breath, but found himself being thrown down again by the angry girl.  
真嗣试图起身喘口气，却被愤怒的女孩再次摔倒。

"_Du verdammter Scheißkerl, Bastard, schwachsinniger Idiot!_ What are you, stupid? I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna kill…" – she stopped her series of insults and assaults only when Shinji managed to get hold of both of her arms.  
“你这个该死的混蛋，杂种，愚蠢的白痴！你是不是脑子有问题？我要杀了你，我要杀了你……”——她在一连串的辱骂和攻击中停了下来，直到真嗣设法抓住了她的双臂。

"Asuka! Stop it, please. You don't understand. It was the only…" – his speech was interrupted when the girl delivered a swift headbutt in his nose.  
"明日香！住手，求你了。你不明白。那是唯一的……" – 他的话被女孩迅速的额头撞击打断，正中他的鼻子。

"I don't give a damn about it, you jerk!"  
"我才不在乎那个，你这个混蛋！"

Shinji felt dizzy with the unexpected blow, but managed to keep his grab on both of the girl's arms and to steady his feet on the soft ground, preventing them from being knocked over again by the strong waves, while she continued to yell at him and a heavy downpour started to come down from the sky.  
真嗣被这突如其来的打击弄得头晕目眩，但还是设法紧紧抓住女孩的双臂，稳住自己在柔软的地面上的脚步，防止他们再次被汹涌的海浪击倒，而她继续对他大喊大叫，同时天空中开始下起了倾盆大雨。

However, the girl refused to give up and, in one precise movement, she took a bite out of the boy, right at the junction between his neck and shoulder, making him scream in pain, which resulted in him pushing her away, while still keeping a strong grab on the girl's arms. As strong as when he grabbed her neck. He could feel that he was hurting her, but he didn't care.  
然而，女孩并未放弃，她以一个精准的动作，咬住了男孩的脖子与肩膀交界处，让他痛得尖叫起来，尽管如此，他仍紧紧抓住女孩的双臂，力度丝毫不减当初掐她脖子时。他能感觉到自己在伤害她，但他毫不在意。

The flash of lightning allowed them to look into each other's eyes that were filled with irrational and pure anger, only to, seconds later, be stunned by the thunderous roar of thunder, causing the storm to fall even more violently, as if the world were collapsing.  
闪电的光芒让他们得以窥见彼此眼中那不理智却纯粹的愤怒，但几秒后，又被雷鸣般的轰隆声所震撼，风暴愈发猛烈，仿佛世界即将崩塌。

"Listen, you _Scheißding,_ I won't EVER let you, of all people, decide my future for me. How dare you think that you can choose my destiny for me and try to send me back with such a cheap trick? If I have to do it your way, I would rather die!"  
“听着，你这混账东西，我绝不会让你这种人决定我的未来。你怎么敢以为你能替我选择命运，还企图用这种卑劣的手段把我送回去？如果我必须按你的方式行事，我宁愿去死！”

Shinji looked at her eyes and at his hands that were still grabbing the girl and decided to play his last card.  
真嗣凝视着她的眼睛，又看了看自己仍在抓着女孩的双手，决定打出最后一张牌。

"Asuka, I… don't want you to pity me, ok?"  
“明日香，我……不想你可怜我，好吗？”

"Well, I don't give a damn about what you want and… wait. What that's supposed to mean?"  
“哼，我才不在乎你想要什么，而且……等等。你这话是什么意思？”

His gambit apparently worked, as the girl stopped her physical and verbal assault for a while.  
他的计策显然奏效了，女孩暂时停止了她的肢体和言语攻击。

"It's like you said before… we have been together for only a few months before the third impact. And that wasn't even a normal life. After that we only faced hell, either together or apart."  
“就像你之前说的……我们在第三次冲击前只在一起了几个月。那甚至不是正常的生活。之后我们面对的只有地狱，无论是一起还是分开。”

The girl looked at him, anger giving place to confusion in her eyes.  
女孩看着他，眼中的愤怒逐渐被困惑所取代。

"That's why… you don't have to sacrifice yourself and your future for me. It's not fair. You deserve a way out instead of being attached to me like a ball and a chain. In fact, you made the right decision when you denied to help me at that time."  
"这就是为什么……你不必为了我牺牲自己和你自己的未来。这不公平。你应该有一个解脱的机会，而不是像枷锁一样被我束缚。事实上，你当时拒绝帮助我是正确的决定。"

The girl looked at him with an unreadable expression.  
女孩看着他，脸上带着难以解读的表情。

"While you were wrong about my feelings, because in the end I tried to reach you and not anybody else, you were right about my selfishness." – he said with a sad look - "I wanted you to accept me only as a mean to take my pain away. I was selfish because I was not strong enough to endure the pain. And I even dared to ask you just after I had defiled you and watched you suffer the worst pain imaginable while I did nothing about it. You were right. I'm just a disgusting and worthless scum. I'm not worthy to be near you just because of the circumstances."  
"尽管你误解了我的感情，因为最终我试图接近的是你而不是别人，但你关于我自私的看法是正确的。" – 他带着悲伤的表情说道 – "我希望你接受我只是为了减轻我的痛苦。我自私是因为我不够坚强去承受那份痛苦。甚至在玷污你、看着你承受难以想象的痛苦而我却无动于衷之后，我还敢向你提出请求。你说得对。我只是一个令人作呕、毫无价值的渣滓。仅仅因为这些情况，我就不配待在你身边。"

At this point his grip on the girl's arm had no strength at all, but she also wasn't making any effort to push him away and resume her previous assault.  
此时他抓着女孩手臂的力道已毫无力气，但她也没有任何试图推开他并继续之前攻击的迹象。

"And because of that self-pity you want to play the hero and sacrifice yourself into a life of misery? That's pathetic! You are just running away again! Like you always do and…"  
“就因为那点自怜，你就想扮演英雄，牺牲自己陷入悲惨的生活？太可悲了！你只是在逃避，又一次！就像你总是做的那样，而且……”

"NO!"

The boy shouted with an angry voice that made the girl flinch.  
男孩愤怒的喊声让女孩不由得一颤。

"Asuka... you're way smarter than me. There is a war taking place out here! Even if we didn't know about it, we were trying to kill each other on a battle field. We are pilots. We are trapped in a hopeless scenario. If the S2 engine is activated without Eva being under control, neither we nor the people outside will survive. And you are the one that has the better odds to make things right. You know that I made the right call. There is no better option here!"  
"明日香...你比我聪明多了。外面正在打仗！即使我们之前不知道，我们在战场上也是互相厮杀。我们是驾驶员。我们被困在一个无望的境地。如果 S2 引擎在没有控制住 Eva 的情况下启动，我们和外面的人都不会幸存。而你更有可能把事情做好。你知道我做出了正确的选择。这里没有更好的选项了！"

She looked at him ready to make a rebuttal, but couldn't find words or formulate a decent answer.  
她看着他准备反驳，却找不到合适的词或组织出像样的回答。

"Look, of course I don't want to die or abandon you. I still don't know if I'm a monster or a martyr. If I'm a doormat or a hero.I don't know what I am and I don't know what I might become in the future. I only know that I will never be the kind of man you would like me to be. I'll hurt you. I will let you down. But the only thing I do know is that I want you to survive and, for once, I can do something to help you. So, please. Let me do this!"  
"听着，我当然不想死或离开你。我仍然不知道自己是怪物还是烈士。我是受气包还是英雄。我不知道自己是什么，也不知道将来会成为什么。我只知道我永远不会成为你希望我成为的那种人。我会伤害你。我会让你失望。但我知道的唯一一件事就是我希望你活下去，而且这一次，我能做些什么来帮你。所以，请让我这么做吧！"

They looked at each other for a few moments until, in a sudden movement, the girl managed to free her arms and projected herself forward, managing to get both of her hands around Shinji's neck.  
他们彼此对视了几秒钟，直到女孩突然动作，设法挣脱了双臂，猛地向前一扑，双手紧紧箍住了真嗣的脖子。

"Hey, idiot... look at me… and pay attention because I will only say it once."  
“嘿，傻瓜……看着我……认真听，因为我只会说一次。”

Shinji's gaze turned to a frightened look, full of despair, as he realized that Asuka's cold stare and the way that she was speaking was making he tremble, just like when she denied to help him during Instrumentality.  
真嗣的目光转为惊恐，满是绝望，他意识到明日香冰冷的凝视和她说话的方式让他颤抖不已，就像她在人类补完计划中拒绝帮助他时一样。

"You are the most idiotic person that I've ever met. You're not and never have been a hero. You didn't pilot an Eva to defend humanity or save the world, you only did it to satisfy your own desires."  
"你是我见过的最愚蠢的人。你从来都不是什么英雄。你没有驾驶 Eva 来保卫人类或拯救世界，你只是为了满足自己的欲望。"

Shinji tried to look away from the girl. It was a hard task, because of her firm grip on his neck.  
真嗣试图避开女孩的目光。这很难，因为她的手紧紧抓着他的脖子。

"You are not the kind of man who will take the initiative and have the attitudes I expect from a partner. You are just a selfish bastard that is looking for anyone to give you unconditional love. You're never going to recognize me, pat me on the head or take care of me in the way I need.  
"你不是那种会主动采取行动，拥有我所期待的伴侣态度的人。你只是一个自私的混蛋，寻找着无条件爱你的人。你永远不会认可我，不会拍拍我的头，也不会以我需要的方式照顾我。"

Also, you don't know what it is to love another person because, although you have learned not to hate yourself, you still can't really love yourself because you are stuck with that feeling of guilt and failure."  
而且，你不明白爱一个人是什么感觉，因为你虽然学会了不恨自己，但你仍然无法真正爱自己，因为你被那种内疚和失败感困住了。

He bit his own lips, in frustration. It was all he could do under those circumstances. But he seems to be doomed to always fail her after all. It was naïve of him to think that…  
他咬着自己的嘴唇，感到无比沮丧。在那种情况下，他只能这么做。但似乎他注定总是让她失望。他曾天真地以为……

"And you know what?" – she moved her hands from his neck to his chin to make him look at her straight at her eyes - "I don't give a damn! I don't care! I can live with that. Because all those flaws… they are just a prove that you're human… that you are still Shinji Ikari. And that is enough. B-being Baka-Shinji is j-just enough." – she said, trying to hold the tears that were forming in her eyes as her right hand softly moved to gently caress his cheek.  
“你知道吗？”——她将双手从他的脖颈移到他的下巴，让他直视她的眼睛——“我不在乎！我不在乎！我能接受。因为所有那些缺点……它们只是证明了你是人……你依然是碇真嗣。这就够了。当个笨蛋真嗣就够了。”——她一边说，一边努力忍住眼眶中打转的泪水，右手轻轻移动，温柔地抚摸着他的脸颊。

"W-why?" – an almost inaudible whisper.  
"为-为什么？" ——近乎无声的低语。

"Shinji… do you really think so little of me? That I would go on and live a happy life knowing that you would've been miserable? That after all that we've faced together I would abandon you and let you suffer a punishment worse than death?"  
"真嗣……你真的这么看轻我吗？认为我会继续活下去，过着幸福的生活，而知道你会痛苦不堪？在我们共同经历了那么多之后，我会抛弃你，让你承受比死亡更可怕的惩罚？"

He looked away from her, in shame, which made the girl return the firm grip on his face, forcing the boy to look at her.  
他羞愧地移开视线，女孩则坚定地抓住他的脸，迫使他看向她。

"Listen, you idiot! I won't let you give up and sacrifice yourself just because you think that you're not worthy. And I won't ever forgive you for trying to trick me! I'm not a doll! I'm not a princess! I don't want to be saved by you or let it up to you to decide what is better for me. I make my own decisions! And right now, I want to…. help you somehow."  
"听着，你这个白痴！我不会让你因为觉得自己不配而放弃并牺牲自己。而且我绝不会原谅你试图欺骗我！我不是玩偶！不是公主！我不想被你拯救，也不想让你决定什么对我更好。我自己做决定！而现在，我想要……以某种方式帮助你。"

Shinji looked at her, in awe. Those last words for sure were intentional, even if the latter part of the phrase wasn't pronounced by the girl's lips.  
真嗣看着她，感到敬畏。最后那几句话无疑是故意的，即使后半部分并非出自女孩的唇间。

"That's why…. That's why, even if you might hate me for that, you can be damn sure that I will be the one in your life that will never submit to your selfish desires! And I won't let you push me away! Not this time! Not ever! So, get up and no more dumb ideas, understand? Or I will really kill you this time." – she said, as she released her grip on his face, swallowing the forming tears, and started to move to get away from the sea, towards the beach.  
""这就是为什么……这就是为什么，即使你可能会因此恨我，你可以确信，我将是那个永远不会屈服于你自私欲望的人！我不会让你推开我！这次不会！永远不会！所以，站起来，别再有愚蠢的想法，明白吗？否则这次我真的会杀了你。"" – 她说着，松开了对他的脸的紧握，咽下了即将形成的泪水，开始向远离大海的方向，朝海滩走去。

Shinji did the same, while making a huge effort to not break down in tears of sadness and joy.  
真嗣也做了同样的动作，尽管他竭尽全力不让悲伤和喜悦的泪水夺眶而出。

As they sat down into the sand - with their clothes soaked, Asuka's braided hair ruined and Shinji's face and neck were still sore and hurt from the beating – the sea seemed to be recovering its blueish color and the rain started to become just a drizzle until it finally stopped.  
当他们坐在沙滩上——衣服湿透，明日香编好的头发凌乱不堪，真嗣的脸和脖子因挨打而依然疼痛——大海似乎正在恢复其蔚蓝色泽，雨势也开始转小，最终完全停歇。

An uncomfortable silence was formed for a while as they looked right into each other's eyes.  
他们凝视着彼此的眼睛，一时间形成了一种令人不安的沉默。

"Asuka…I... thank you… thank you for…"  
"明日香…我…谢谢你…谢谢你为我…"

"Cut it off! Don't forget that I'm still mad at you. I will not allow you of all people to try to push me away again, you understood?"  
"别说了！别忘了我还在生你的气。我不允许你再试图推开我，你明白吗？"

He nodded, while using his hand to touch the base of his neck, still sore because of the bite.  
他点点头，同时用手触摸着脖子根部，那里因为咬痕仍然感到疼痛。

The scene made the girl turn her face away from him, hiding a soft blush, while Shinji chuckled a little, even if the pain caused from his recent beating was starting to be felt by his body. But there was no time to think about that. The main issue wasn't solved yet.  
这一幕让女孩转过脸去，藏起一抹淡淡的红晕，而真嗣轻声笑了笑，尽管刚挨打的疼痛开始在身体中蔓延。但没时间考虑这些了。主要问题还未解决。

" Asuka… you… have you thought about another way for us to escape from there?"  
“明日香……你……有没有想过其他逃离那里的办法？”

"No."

"But then… what should we do?"  
“但那样……我们该怎么办？”

"I-I don't know! You have been through this before. Think about it. The one who can find a solution is you."  
"我-我不知道！你以前经历过这种情况。好好想想。能找到解决办法的人只有你。"

"We can't, Asuka. I've already…"  
"我们做不到，明日香。我已经……"

"I know it, you idiot! I don't know what to do! Just… do something, Baka-Shinji!"  
"我知道，你这个白痴！我不知道该怎么办！总之……做点什么吧，笨蛋真嗣！"

Her words triggered something inside him. How could he not have realized it before? When it came to supporting each other in battle, it always had been the same pattern between them. Just like that dance. She would always take the initiative and push him forward and force him to move from his inertia, to try to keep up with her. But when she would slip or make a mistake because of that attitude and her inner instability, he would be there and adjust, to make sure that she wouldn't fall. Attack and defense. Yin and Yang. As individuals, just two flawed and scared children. Together? Invincible.  
她的话语触动了他内心某处。他怎会至今才意识到？在战斗中相互扶持时，他们之间总是一成不变的模式。就像那支舞。她总是主动出击，推动他前进，迫使他从惯性中挣脱，努力跟上她的步伐。但当她因那种态度和内心的不稳而滑倒或失误时，他会及时调整，确保她不会跌倒。攻与守，阴与阳。作为个体，只是两个有缺陷、害怕的孩子。合而为一？则无敌。

Yeah, it was probably just a wishful thinking. But it was that thought that gave him hope that there was still a possibility. It was an insane idea, but… he just knew that he had to try. To take the risk. For her. And for himself. Like he did before. Like he should have done in that fatidic day, instead of being a coward.  
是啊，这或许只是个美好的愿望。但正是这个念头给了他希望，让他相信还有可能。这想法虽疯狂，但他就是知道，他必须尝试。冒险一试。为了她，也为了自己。就像他以前做的那样。就像在那命运之日，他本该勇敢面对，而非懦弱逃避。

"W-well…. There might be a way but…"  
“嗯……或许有办法，但是……”

"But what? You've just had an epiphany now or you already knew about that? Why did you take so long to open your mouth? Tell me already!"  
"但是什么？你现在是突然顿悟了还是早就知道？为什么拖了这么久才开口？快告诉我！"

"I'm scared Asuka!" – he shouted – "I'm afraid that… what I'll propose here may not work and will be ending up being just another of my selfish wishes. Another way of running away that will just hurt us both at the end, and…"- he stopped his rant, as he felt her hand touching his cheek.  
""我害怕，明日香！"" – 他喊道 – ""我担心……我在这里提出的建议可能行不通，最终只是我自私的愿望之一。另一种逃避的方式，最终只会让我们双方都受伤，而且……""- 他停了下来，感觉到她的手触碰着他的脸颊。

"No, Shinji. This time you won't be running away. Because this is something we have chosen to do together. Like two soldiers on a battlefield. And your idea, no matter how stupid it is, will surely be no more insane than Misato's battle plans. So, even if your idea is stupid, it's still a… chance. And I won't miss it. Just spill out the plan and I will make it work."  
"不，真嗣。这次你不会逃避了。因为这是我们共同选择的。就像战场上的两名士兵。你的想法，不管有多愚蠢，肯定不会比美里那些战斗计划更疯狂。所以，即使你的想法很愚蠢，它仍然是一个……机会。我不会错过的。快说出计划，我会让它成功的。"

"You… will trust me?" "你……会相信我吗？"

"Of course. Who the hell do you think I am?"  
"当然。你以为我是谁啊？"

He looked at her confident smirk, while also noticing that her knees were shaking. It assured him, one more time, that all of this was real. That was the real Asuka. A scared child just like he was, but the one that will complete him, giving him the fire and the strength that he needs to stop him from falling into his own apathy and fears.  
他看着她自信的微笑，同时也注意到她的膝盖在颤抖。这让他再次确信，这一切都是真实的。那就是真正的明日香。一个和他一样害怕的孩子，但却是那个能让他完整的人，给予他所需的火焰和力量，阻止他陷入自己的冷漠和恐惧中。

"Well…. For this idea to work we will have to believe that… my mother might have been wrong."  
"嗯……为了让这个想法成立，我们必须相信……我母亲可能是错的。"

Asuka looked at him, shocked, with a mix of emotions in her face. The boy's plan was based on assuming that the person who created Evangelion was wrong. It was pure madness! Non-sense! Too much for her rational mind to accept.  
明日香看着他，脸上混合着震惊与各种情绪。这男孩的计划基于一个假设：创造出 EVA 的人是错的。这简直是疯狂！荒谬至极！她的理性思维难以接受。

"Please, let me finish." – he said, as he knew that the girl was on the verge of yelling at him - "The Evangelion needs a soul in its core to work. To be honest, that's the only thing it really needs. Think about the times that Unit 01 did all those weird things in battle."  
"请让我说完。"" – 他说道，知道女孩快要对他大吼了 – ""EVA 的核心需要一个灵魂才能运作。老实说，这是它真正需要的唯一东西。想想 01 号机在战斗中做的那些奇怪的事情。"

"Ok… that… makes sense." "嗯……这么说……有道理。"

"The pilot is just another soul who is able to retain the human form and conscious mind to be able to direct the Evangelion in a proper and most efficient way. But we are in fact not unreplaceable, just like the dummy system proved."  
"驾驶员只是另一个能够保持人形和意识清醒的灵魂，以便能够以正确和最有效的方式引导 EVA。但实际上我们并非不可替代，正如傀儡系统所证明的那样。"

"You mean that the Evangelion can move without a pilot or even a dummy system, if it has one soul inside of its core with enough self-awareness to act by its own will. I… get it. It probably was hard for your mother to try to do that, but she managed to do it in some occasions. But… if there are two souls inside the core…"  
"你的意思是，如果 EVA 的核心中有一个具备足够自我意识、能按其自身意志行动的灵魂，它就能在没有驾驶员甚至傀儡系统的情况下移动。我……明白了。你母亲尝试这样做想必很困难，但她偶尔还是成功了。但是……如果核心中有两个灵魂……"

"Y-yeah… exactly. So, I guess that we can try to act together to move the Eva without having to suppress our individuality and without merging with each other. We will just manifest our conjoined will to make the Eva move, like we were piloting it. Like we did that time on the ocean, with Unit 02."  
"嗯……没错。所以，我想我们可以尝试一起行动，不需压抑各自的个性，也不必融合彼此。我们只需展现共同的意志来驱动 Eva，就像我们在驾驶它一样。就像那次在海上，驾驶二号机那样。"

"However, in doing so…" – Asuka realized - "We will push our consciousness deeper inside of the Evangelion's core. And by doing it, it means that we will become even more detached of the outside world, so our physical bodies won't be able to be retrieved from here. We will become trapped for good. Just like our mothers were."  
"然而，这样做的话……" – 明日香意识到 - "我们会将意识更深入地推入 Eva 的核心。这样一来，意味着我们将更加脱离外界，我们的肉体将无法从这里被找回。我们将永远被困住。就像我们的母亲们一样。"

Shinji gave her a soft nod.  
真嗣轻轻地点了点头。

"But… what you really are trying to say is that we will do this while also trying to maintain enough consciousness and awareness to be able to pilot the Evangelion just as well as if we were in our physical bodies. And, to be able to do that, we will have to be locked in a state of perpetual struggle with each other just to keep our own sense of self and individuality, trying to avoid being merged like in instrumentality and also avoid killing each other's essence. Is that it?"  
"但…你真正想说的是，我们将一边努力保持足够的意识和清醒，以便能够像在实体身体中一样熟练地驾驶 EVA。而且，为了做到这一点，我们将不得不陷入与彼此的永恒斗争中，只是为了保持自己的自我和个性，试图避免像在工具化中那样融合，同时也要避免扼杀彼此的本质。是这样吗？"

"Y-yes… I'm afraid so." "是…是的…恐怕是这样。"

They stared into each other's face for a while, while they processed the conversation that they just had and its implications.  
他们凝视着对方的脸，一时间，他们都在消化刚刚的对话及其含义。

"Hmph. How pathetic…" – she said, making Shinji felt a pain in his heart – "to see that the Evangelion, the greatest invention in human history, will become just a luxury prison for two trouble teenagers that are destined to spend eternity together, with the sole goal of trying to resolve our endless traumas to be able to keep ourselves alive. Can we at least ask someone to bring your cello here, third?" – she finished with a mocking voice and a smirk on her face.  
"哼，真是可悲……" – 她的话语让真嗣心头一痛 – "眼看着人类历史上最伟大的发明，EVA，竟沦为两个麻烦少男少女的豪华牢笼，注定要永远相伴，只为解决我们无尽的创伤，以求苟延残喘。我们至少能请人把你的大提琴带来吧，三号？" – 她以嘲讽的语气说完，脸上挂着一抹讥笑。

Shinji blinked two times until he understood the punchline and finally laughed at her playful comment. That's was Asuka, at her very best. The Great Asuka Langley Sohryu. The one that, even against the odds, would try her best to achieve victory, to the point of laughing in face of the unknow.  
真嗣眨了两次眼才领会到笑点，终于被她俏皮的评论逗笑了。这就是最棒的明日香，伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷。哪怕面对逆境，她也会竭尽全力争取胜利，甚至敢于在未知面前放声大笑。

"Well… I think that Eva will always be something more than that. But, all things considered, I guess it's fine if that's the destination we will give to it. So… that's it. You think it can work?"  
"嗯……我觉得 EVA 总归不止于此。但话说回来，如果那就是我们赋予它的归宿，我想也无妨。那么……就这样吧。你觉得这能行吗？"

"I guess so. It takes a big leap of faith to believe that it will work, but it sounds like a plan. And it's a better option than resign ourselves to the fate of becoming mere pawns of schemes and war games created by power-hungry fanatics. Pathetic people that refuse to grown up and who only want to mold the world into their own beliefs, and would love to see us dead or suffering. So, I'm in. Even if our destiny is to be tied with Evangelion forever, until we lose our consciousness and become just dreams of a distant God… we …." – the girl suddenly lost the fire in her voice and started to feel worried.  
"我想是的。要相信这会成功，需要极大的信念飞跃，但听起来是个计划。而且，这比屈服于那些权力狂热者策划的阴谋和战争游戏，成为他们手中的棋子要好。那些拒绝成长、只想将世界塑造成自己信念的人，巴不得我们死去或受苦。所以，我加入。即使我们的命运永远与《新世纪福音战士》捆绑在一起，直到我们失去意识，成为遥远上帝的梦境……我们……" – 女孩的声音突然失去了热情，开始感到担忧。

"Asuka… You're really ok with that? We can still think about another…"  
"明日香…你真的接受这个了吗？我们还可以考虑其他的……"

"No! Forget it. I am ok. We both have concluded there is no better way. But the thing is that I… I'm… I'm really sorry, Shinji."  
"不！别提了。我没事。我们都认为没有更好的办法了。但问题是，我……我……真的很抱歉，真嗣。"

"Erh? Why?" – said the surprised boy as he heard, for the first time, a sincere apology from Asuka.  
"呃？为什么？" – 男孩惊讶地说道，这是他第一次听到明日香真诚的道歉。

"Well… Think about it. In the end, with my actions, I've managed to force you to give up on saving the world or seeking your own happiness… only to become forever trapped inside an Evangelion, the thing you hate the most in the world."  
"嗯……想想看。最终，我的行为迫使你放弃了拯救世界或追求自己的幸福……只是永远被困在初号机里，那正是你在这个世界上最讨厌的东西。"

"What? No… I…" "什么？不……我……"

"And to make things even worse, you'll have to share this uncomfortable place with me – of all people from Earth - for who knows how long. I think that's the closest thing to hell or another kind of eternal punishment you could have had in the end."  
"更糟糕的是，你还得和我——地球上所有人中偏偏是我——共享这个不舒服的地方，天知道要多久。我想这几乎是地狱或另一种永恒惩罚的终极形式了。"

Asuka looked away from her companion, awkwardly playing with her hair in an attempt of hiding her face from the boy's sight. Shinji took a deep breath and started to speak again.  
明日香避开她的同伴，尴尬地摆弄着头发，试图从男孩的视线中隐藏自己的脸。真嗣深吸了一口气，再次开口。

"You're wrong Asuka… I guess my mother was right on that topic."  
"你错了，明日香……我想在这点上，我母亲是对的。"

"What do you mean?" – said the girl with a hint of interest.  
"你这是什么意思？" – 女孩带着一丝兴趣说道。

"After all of the possibilities and places that I've been… all the scenarios and universes that I've seen during instrumentality and in my mind…even if I despise Eva… I know that this world is real. As real as any other possible world. And we are here now, together, so…" - Shinji closed his eyes as he remembered Yui's words – "if both of us have the will to live… any place can be paradise. We are alive, so we will always have the chance to be happy."  
"经历了所有的可能性与地方，我在工具化期间以及脑海中见过的所有场景和宇宙……即使我厌恶 Eva……我也知道这个世界是真实的。和其他任何可能的世界一样真实。而现在我们在一起，所以……" - 真嗣闭上眼睛，回忆起唯的话语 – "如果我们都有活下去的意愿……任何地方都可以是天堂。我们活着，所以我们总有机会获得幸福。"

"I see." – answered the dejected girl – "So, you actually agree that ours is indeed a cursed destiny, but you are saying that you will try to make it work even if it is hopeless."  
"我明白了。" – 沮丧的女孩回答道 – "所以，你实际上承认我们的命运确实是被诅咒的，但你表示即使没有希望，你也会努力让它变得可行。"

"Well… Yes, but… no... I mean… I know it's selfish but… what I'm trying to say is… If I have to stay trapped inside this imperfect Evangelion forever but, by doing so, I will be able to share a whole eternity with you…"  
"嗯…是的，但…不是…我的意思是…我知道这很自私，但…我想说的是…如果我必须永远被困在这个不完美的 EVA 里，但这样做，我就能与你共享永恒…"

She looked at the him with a frightened, but firm stare.  
她用一种既害怕又坚定的目光看着他。

"It will be ok. I mean… I will be ok. We will be ok. More than ok, really. After all, Evangelion is not a curse. I wasn't really happy before Eva entered my life. But now, even though Eva didn't give me answers, it made me realize that even if the world and the circumstances aren't the way we want them to be, I can be happy. We can be happy. Well…. what I really mean is: I'm really glad to be able to be with you. Not because I'm afraid of being alone or that I can't do it without you. The point is: if you are together with me, this Evangelion can become a place that I will be able to call… heaven."  
"一切都会好的。我是说…我会没事的。我们都会没事的。不仅仅是没事，真的。毕竟，EVA 不是诅咒。在 EVA 进入我的生活之前，我并不真正快乐。但现在，尽管 EVA 没有给我答案，它让我意识到，即使世界和环境不是我们想要的那样，我也可以快乐。我们可以快乐。嗯…我真正想说的是：我很高兴能和你在一起。不是因为我害怕孤独，或者没有你我就做不到。关键是：如果你和我在一起，这个 EVA 就能成为我可以称之为…天堂的地方。"

"S-stop saying such corny and embarrassing things, stupid. – the girl responded with more harshness than usual, but after a while, continued to talk with a lower voice. "Things won't be this easy and you should know better."  
"别再说这么老套又让人尴尬的话了，笨蛋。" 女孩的回应比平时更加尖锐，但过了一会儿，她继续用更低的声音说道，"事情不会这么简单的，你应该更明白。"

"Well, I…" "嗯，我…"

"Shinji, this is a serious issue. I… even if we can manage to do it, it won't be anything like a paradise. It will hurt. A lot. It always does. It already happened before. What if this core messes ups with our minds and souls and everything becomes like it was instrumentality all over again? Will I hurt you until the point in that you will decide to kill me again? Or it will be me who will kill you this time?"  
"真嗣，这是个严肃的问题。我…即使我们能设法做到，那也不会是天堂。那会很痛苦。非常痛苦。总是如此。以前就发生过。万一这个核心扰乱了我们的心智和灵魂，一切又变得像补完计划那样怎么办？我会不会再次伤害你，直到你决定再次杀了我？还是这次会是我杀了你？"

"And so, what?!" – said Shinji, with an unusual shout that took his companion by surprise.  
“那又怎样？！” ——真嗣带着出乎意料的喊声说道，这让他的同伴感到惊讶。

"Asuka… I know that we've learned to stop hating ourselves and we also stopped to hate each other. But we are still learning how to love and forgive ourselves. And I think that once we are able to do so…. we won't hurt each other anymore and even if we did… we will be able to forgive each other, won't we?"  
“明日香…我知道我们已经学会了不再自我憎恨，也停止了彼此间的憎恨。但我们仍在学习如何爱自己、原谅自己。我想，一旦我们能做到这一点…我们就不会再伤害对方，即使真的发生了…我们也能够彼此原谅，不是吗？”

Asuka looked away with a sad smile on her face.  
明日香带着悲伤的微笑别过脸去。

"I assure you, Asuka. I will make mistakes. I will eventually even hurt you. But I won't run away. Not this time. No matter what happens. Not after all we had been through and not after all that you've said to me here. I'll fight for this new chance. Because this time we have a chance to face this challenge together. This time I know that you will be there fighting hard by my side and I also will be fighting hard by your side."- the boy said with a renewed fire in his eyes, making his companion take a step backwards in surprise.  
"我向你保证，明日香。我会犯错，最终甚至会伤害你。但我不会逃避。这次不会。无论发生什么。经历了这么多，听了你在这里对我说的话，我会为这个新机会而战。因为这次我们有共同面对挑战的机会。这次我知道你会在我身边努力战斗，我也会在你身边努力战斗。" 男孩眼中燃起新的火焰，让他的同伴惊讶地后退了一步。

"And that's what gives me confidence. That's what makes me believe that we can do it. We will defy all the odds and even make the impossible turn into reality. We won't fail! We won't lose! We never did when we were fighting together inside of an Evangelion."  
"正是这一点给了我信心。正是这一点让我相信我们能做到。我们将挑战所有不可能，甚至将不可能变为现实。我们不会失败！我们不会输！当我们一起在 EVA 里战斗时，我们从未失败过。"

Asuka looked, in awe, as he continued to speak, with even more determination in his voice.  
明日香带着敬畏之情看着他继续说话，他的声音中充满了更多的决心。

"But more importantly… we will prove that my mother was wrong about the Evangelion and the decision that she made. And that my father was wrong too. Because humans were not made to be alone and isolated from the world protected by their own AT-Fields. And also, we were not made to abandon the AT-Fields and live as one single being. It can be painful, but …"  
"但更重要的是……我们将证明我母亲关于 EVA 和她所做决定的看法是错误的。我父亲也是错的。因为人类并非注定要孤独地与世隔绝，被自己的 AT 力场保护着。同样，我们也不是注定要放弃 AT 力场，作为单一的个体生活。这可能很痛苦，但是……"

He stopped and closed his eyes for a while, taking a deep breath.  
他停了下来，闭上眼睛片刻，深吸了一口气。

"Asuka... I know that by doing it we may not be able to fix or rebuild this world. But we will live. And instead of trying to destroy Eva to avoid the pain and delusions that it causes, or even to trap one single soul and its individuality in the Eva as a testimony that mankind existed… we can show that we found this answer. Not a neon genesis but a - he raised his hand and bumped on his chest - Neon Testament!"  
"明日香……我知道这样做我们可能无法修复或重建这个世界。但我们会活下去。与其试图摧毁 EVA 以避免它带来的痛苦和幻觉，甚至将一个灵魂及其个性困在 EVA 中作为人类存在的证明……我们可以展示我们找到了这个答案。不是新的创世纪，而是——他举起手，敲了敲自己的胸口——新的见证！"

Asuka stared at him, dumbfounded, trying to sort out everything that she just listened from the man that was standing in front of her.  
明日香盯着他，目瞪口呆，试图整理从站在她面前的这个男人那里听到的所有信息。

"Shinji, you… what you're trying to say is that… we can use Eva to find an answer to the human instrumentality project? To prove that humans can find balance and harmony within themselves and each other while also keeping their individuality?  
“真嗣，你……你想说的是……我们可以利用 Eva 来找到人类补完计划的答案？证明人类能在保持个体性的同时，找到内在的平衡与和谐？”

"Well…yes? Maybe. To be fair I wasn't thinking of solving the human equation or something like that" – he said as he scratched the back of his head.  
“嗯……是的？或许吧。公平地说，我并没有考虑解决人类方程式之类的问题”——他说着挠了挠后脑勺。

"You really are an idiot, you know?" – said Asuka with a sigh - "Shinji…. I don't know if I will be able to make it work.…I've told you before…. I'm not a concept. I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. I'm not perfect. I'll not be able to help you or give what you need. You will be unhappy."  
"你真是个傻瓜，知道吗？" ——明日香叹了口气说—— "真嗣……我不知道我们能不能行。……我之前就告诉过你……我不是什么概念。我只是个寻找内心安宁的混乱女孩。我不完美。我帮不了你，也给不了你需要的。你会不开心的。"

"Maybe. But it's a risk I'm willing to take... I already told you before: I want to help you somehow and be with you forever. To be honest, I can't think of anything I don't like about you right now."  
"或许吧。但这是我愿意承担的风险……我之前就说过：我想以某种方式帮助你，永远和你在一起。说实话，我现在想不出你有什么我不喜欢的地方。"

"But you will! You will regret it. You will think of things. Think about everybody else. Think about how I hurt you. Think how about we could have had another life. About how our reality sucks. And I'll also do that. And I will get angry with you and feel trapped because that's what happens with me. I cannot promise you that I won't try to push myself deeper into the core of this Eva and shut it down forever. And by doing so I will not only fail you, but will also betray all those your theories and this testament of yours will be doomed."  
"但你总有一天会的！你会后悔的。你会想起其他所有人。想起我如何伤害了你。想起我们本可以有另一种生活。想起我们的现实有多糟糕。我也会那样想。我会对你生气，感到被困，因为这就是我的命运。我无法向你保证我不会试图更深入地进入这架 Eva 的核心，永远关闭它。那样做的话，我不仅会让你失望，还会背叛你所有的理论，你的这份遗言也将注定失败。"

"It's ok. I don't mind if we fail or what legacy we will make. We are not slaves of the destiny. I will never force you to do anything you don't want to and, even if you don't agree with me, I will be there for can always change course and choose another way. And when the time comes, we will decide it… together." – Shinji answered her with a true gentle and heartwarming smile.  
“没关系。我不介意我们是否失败，或者会留下怎样的遗产。我们不是命运的奴隶。我永远不会强迫你做任何你不想做的事，即使你不同意我，我也会在那里，我们可以随时改变方向，选择另一条路。等到那时，我们会一起决定……” —— 真嗣以一种真诚、温柔且令人心暖的微笑回答她。

She looked into his eyes, searching for any trace of doubt or resentment, to no avail.  
她凝视着他的眼睛，寻找任何一丝怀疑或怨恨的痕迹，却一无所获。

The meaning was clear. Just as she had caressed his face that day on the beach while being strangled by an enraged Shinji, he is also making a promise.  
其含义不言而喻。正如那天在海滩上，她在被愤怒的真嗣扼住时轻抚他的脸庞一样，他也在做出一个承诺。

A promise to not abandon her. A promise to not force his will on her. A promise to recognize her as a person despite of her flaws.  
一个不抛弃她的承诺。一个不强加他意志于她的承诺。一个尽管她有缺点，仍将她视为人的承诺。

He is willing and vowing to reciprocate with affection and understanding even at the dark moments where she will succumb to her anger and fears and reveal the worst within her heart.  
他愿意并誓言在黑暗时刻以爱与理解回应，即便那时她将屈服于愤怒与恐惧，展露内心最糟糕的一面。

They lock eyes for a long moment.  
他们长久地凝视着彼此的眼睛。

Asuka was still stone-faced, while Shinji started to develop a worried, knit brow.  
明日香依旧面无表情，而真嗣开始皱起眉头，显得忧心忡忡。

Asuka cracks up. 明日香突然笑出声来。

"Are you sure?" "你确定吗？"

"I'm so sure." “我可不信。”

She stared deep into his eyes. This time he didn't look away from her as he had done most of the other times that they've exchanged those serious glances.  
她深深凝视着他的眼睛。这一次，他没有像以往大多数时候那样避开她的目光，而是与她严肃对视。

That moment lasted a few seconds… or maybe it lasted hours? Years? A lifetime? Everlong? It's hard to be aware of the passage of time while being inside an Evangelion core immersed in a Dirac Sea.  
那一刻持续了几秒……或者可能是几小时？几年？一生？永恒？身处沉浸在狄拉克海中的 EVA 核心里，时间流逝变得难以察觉。

After making sure that the man wouldn't flinch or look away, Asuka felt a smile grow on her face and also a good and warm feeling rise in her chest.  
确认了男人不会再退缩或移开视线后，明日香脸上绽放出笑容，心中也涌起一股温暖而美好的感觉。

Since she was reborn that day on the beach, she was sure that she would always love and hate Shinji Ikari. Those feelings weren't opposite, but complimentary. Tangled in a way that couldn't be undone. But now, after all this time, she couldn't feel any kind of vitriol or hate towards that man. And that made her heart beat faster, her face get warmer and a pleasant warm and fuzzy feeling chills down all over her body. So, maybe, all that have remained from those old feelings that she always bore for that beautiful boy…is only love?  
自从那天在海滩上重生以来，她确信自己会永远爱恨碇真嗣。这些情感并非对立，而是互补的。纠缠得无法解开。但如今，经历了这么长时间，她对那个男人再也感受不到任何恶意或恨意。这让她心跳加速，脸颊发热，全身涌起一种愉悦的温暖感觉。那么，或许，她对那个美丽男孩一直怀有的旧情，剩下的只有爱了？

"You know what Shinji? You're right. Yes. We will do it. It won't be easy. Nothing has ever been easy for us after all. But we will make it work. You and me. Together. Until the end of this universe. Until the end of times. Even after the end of all Evangelions. _Per aspera, ad astra,_ right? It's a promise, right?"  
“你知道吗，真嗣？你说得对。是的，我们会做到的。这不会容易。毕竟，我们的一切从未容易过。但我们会让它成功。你和我。一起。直到这个宇宙的尽头。直到时间的尽头。甚至在所有福音战士之后。历经艰难，终至星辰，对吧？这是承诺，对吧？”

"Asuka… I… I'm glad that you think that way and I promise that I will be here together with you but…I didn't get that last part… I think that you spoke that in German."  
“明日香……我……我很高兴你这么想，我承诺我会和你一起在这里，但是……我没听懂最后那部分……我想你用德语说的。”

Asuka looked at him in disbelief and after a moment of realization, facepalmed and sighed in a playful way.  
明日香难以置信地看着他，片刻后恍然大悟，俏皮地捂脸叹息。

"Baka-Shinji… I think I will need a whole eternity to explain everything I know to you. From the physics involving nature of space and time and other concepts that are way more complicated than thermal expansion, to the German language, Bible references and the simple things about the common life… _Got_t, I will have to teach you a lot of things. Like how to develop a sense of humor or how you need to hold a person when you're kissing her..."  
“笨蛋真嗣……我想我需要整整一辈子来向你解释我所知道的一切。从涉及空间和时间本质的物理学，以及其他比热膨胀复杂得多的概念，到德语、圣经引用和日常生活中的简单事物……天啊，我得教你很多东西。比如如何培养幽默感，或者接吻时该如何拥抱一个人……”

He looked into her eyes with a big smile on his face and a look of true happiness in his eyes. At the same time, the woman's cheeks were starting to turn into an intense shade of red as she quickly averted her face from his gaze, turning to look directly in the opposite direction.  
他满面笑容，眼中闪烁着真正的幸福，凝视着她的眼睛。与此同时，女子的脸颊开始泛起浓烈的绯红，她迅速避开他的目光，转向相反的方向直视。

"D-don't get any wrong ideas you pervert. I've said that… it's just because… I mean… eternity is such a long time… And eventually I'm gonna get bored, that's all…"  
"别胡思乱想，你这个变态。我说了……只是因为……我的意思是……永恒太长了……总有一天我会厌倦的，仅此而已……"

Shinji's smile got even bigger, as he was trying hard to not bust up laughing. After so long he finally began to understand a little bit more about the true feelings and the mysterious ways of thinking and acting of the woman he loved. And these good sensations that he was feeling acted as the catalyst that allowed him to get the courage to move forward.  
真嗣的笑容更加灿烂了，他努力忍住不笑出声来。经过这么长时间，他终于开始更深入地理解他所爱的女人的真实情感和神秘的思维与行为方式。这些美好的感觉成为催化剂，让他有勇气继续前进。

"Oh… I get it Asuka… w-well…just in case you're wrong…let's make a bet."  
"哦……我明白了，明日香……嗯……万一你错了……我们打个赌吧。"

Asuka looked back at him, visibly surprised.  
明日香回头看向他，明显感到惊讶。

"What?" "什么？"

"I bet… that you won't get bored while being here with me. If I win, I will be able to make that second try of the bet you did in the train. If I lost, you can do what you usually want to do when you're bored. Deal? Or are you gonna chicken out?"  
“我打赌……和我在一起你不会感到无聊。如果我赢了，我就能让你在火车上做的那个赌注再来一次。如果我输了，你可以做你平时无聊时想做的事。成交？还是说你要临阵退缩？”

Asuka looked at him with a gaze that reflected a mixture of amazement, anger, admiration, attraction and… an exquisite, but not disgusting feeling.  
明日香看着他，眼神中混合着惊奇、愤怒、钦佩、吸引以及……一种微妙但不令人反感的感觉。

Shinji continued to smile and to keep the feeling of joy and happiness in his gaze which, after a few moments, was replicated by Asuka, who once again fixed her eyes on the man's face. And that did it. They busted out laughing.  
真嗣继续微笑着，眼中保持着那份喜悦和幸福，几秒钟后，明日香也模仿起来，再次将目光固定在真嗣的脸上。就这样，他们爆发出了笑声。

Perhaps for the first time in all of the time that they had known each other, the two were finally able to establish a moment of perfect communication and an accurate understanding with each other, not only of the words and feelings involved, but also of everything that was laying between the lines.  
或许这是他们相识以来第一次，两人终于能够建立起一个完美的沟通时刻，准确地理解对方，不仅是言语和情感，还包括字里行间的一切。

Both of them understood that they would surely have a rather "boring" eternity ahead and betting against that would be the equivalent of asking to lose every time. But with this new game they started to play there are no losers or winners. The outcome was guaranteed.  
他们俩都明白，未来必定会有一个相当“无聊”的永恒等待着他们，而对此下注无异于每次都注定失败。但在这个新开始的游戏中，没有输家也没有赢家。结果是注定的。

It was not even a game anymore. It was also not a fight or that old eternal struggle that they have endured before. It was… like a dance.  
这已不再是游戏。同样，它也不是战斗，或是他们曾经历过的那场永恒的挣扎。它……宛如一支舞。

And they were finding the perfect tune to keep on dancing to their infinite playlist, composed by the sounds of their hearts beating in synchrony with each other.  
他们正寻觅着完美的旋律，随着彼此心跳的和谐共鸣，继续舞动在这无尽的播放列表中。

They had already proved from the start that they could synchronize their minds and bodies. Different individuals, but able to work together in perfect harmony. Now they could do the next step and do the same with their hearts and souls.  
从一开始，他们就证明了能够同步心智与身体。虽是不同的个体，却能完美协作。如今，他们可以迈出下一步，让心灵与灵魂也达到同样的和谐。

That's the answer that they were looking for all of this time. The hope that the porcupine embrace can be solved with a constant coupled effort.  
这就是他们一直以来寻求的答案。希望通过持续的共同努力，能够解决刺猬拥抱的难题。

"Ready to go, Shinji? Just remember, full power, maximum performance,"  
“准备好了吗，真嗣？记住，全力以赴，发挥到极致，”

"Yes. We will finish it. No matter how much time it takes."  
“是的。我们会完成它。无论需要多少时间。”

They blinked, at the same time.  
他们同时眨了眨眼。

As they opened their eyes again, they could feel the Evangelion leaving Earth's atmosphere and flying towards the Moon, with its AT-Field forming a brilliant halo that resembled a crown of stars over its head.  
当他们再次睁开眼睛时，能感觉到 EVA 正离开地球大气层，向月球飞去，其 AT 力场形成了一个璀璨的光环，宛如头顶上的星冠。

They blinked once more and they realized that they were now far away from Earth. Maybe somewhere between Jupiter and Mars.  
他们再次眨眼，意识到自己已经远离地球，或许在木星与火星之间的某个位置。

At the next blink, they realized that time has not skipped. They were at the same place. It meant that they were doing it right. They were making it work, finally being in tune with each other and also with the Evangelion, without losing their individualities.  
下一瞬眨眼间，他们意识到时间并未跳跃。他们仍身处原地。这意味着他们正做着正确的事。他们终于让一切运转起来，与彼此、与福音战士和谐同步，同时不失各自的个性。

They realized that, even if it's not the way that they wanted or imagined it, they will finally be able to be themselves. Two children, playing among the stars, with the certainty that all is right with the world. Their world.  
他们明白，即便这不是他们所期望或想象的方式，他们终将能做回自己。两个孩子在星辰间嬉戏，确信世界一切安好，属于他们的世界。

They didn't know if they would ever be able to return to the real world or if they would be trapped inside Eva forever.  
他们不知道是否还能重返现实世界，抑或永远被困在 Eva 之中。

But they knew that, eventually, there will be a time when they will manage to grow up.  
但他们知道，终有一天，他们会设法长大成人。

To hold hands. 牵手。

To kiss. 亲吻。

To be true to each other.  
彼此真诚相待。

Or, in other words, love each other.  
换言之，相爱。

So, let's go to one last kiss.  
那么，让我们走向最后一个吻。

---
Gendo Ikari kept a calm and peaceful countenance while the Euronerv technicians and operators tried, unsuccessfully, to report on what was happening in the battle.  
碇源堂保持着冷静和平和的表情，而欧洲 NERV 的技术人员和操作员们则试图，但未能成功地报告战场上的情况。

The reborn Eva Unit 02 had finally absorbed the core of the hybrid unit, removing the organic parts amidst the array of robotic parts belonging to Jet Alone.  
重生的 EVA 二号机终于吸收了混合单元的核心，在众多属于 Jet Alone 的机器人部件中移除了有机部分。

After incorporation, as predicted, the Eva awakened its previously dormant S2 engine, resulting in the opening of a Dirac Sea.  
正如预料，融合后，Eva 唤醒了其先前沉睡的 S2 引擎，导致狄拉克之海的开启。

That Evangelion now possessed unlimited energy, being able to subdue all forces existing on Earth, so as to ensure absolute control over the planet and the ability to repair the destroyed world at an accelerated rate.  
那台 Eva 现在拥有无限能量，能够压制地球上所有力量，从而确保对地球的绝对控制，并能以加速的速度修复被摧毁的世界。

But he knew this would not happen. Operation Unsinkable had failed. Most of the Euronerv technicians had not realized that there was no longer any register of signals from the pilots involved in the battle, which revealed that the unit was no longer under Nerv control. Just like Yui did with the ascended Unit 01, it was up to those two pilots, now children of an Elder God, to decide the fate of that Evangelion.  
但他知道这不会发生。不沉行动已经失败。大多数 Euronerv 技术人员并未意识到，战斗中涉及的飞行员信号已不复存在，这表明该单位已不再受 Nerv 控制。正如 Yui 对升格的 01 号机所做的那样，现在取决于那两位成为古神之子的飞行员来决定那台 Eva 的命运。

Gendo took this moment to retire from his command post and return to his quarters, while awaiting the inevitable outcome of the battle that would surprise and cut the hearts and hopes of all those people who were celebrating the victory.  
在这个时刻，源度离开了指挥岗位，返回自己的房间，等待着这场战斗不可避免的结果，这个结果将令所有正在庆祝胜利的人们感到意外，并击碎他们的心与希望。

As soon as he managed to reach his room, Gendo looked out the window and he saw Unit 02 in its old blood-red color floating in the air, with a bright halo above its head, as if it were a Crown of Stars.  
一进入房间，源度便走到窗前，他看到二号机以旧时的血红色悬浮在空中，头顶上闪耀着明亮的光环，宛如一顶星辰之冠。

As the Evangelion was taking off into space he preferred to verbalize what he was thinking, although he knew his words would be useless, for there would be no one who could hear them.  
当福音战士升空进入太空时，他宁愿将所思所想化为言语，尽管他知道这些话毫无用处，因为没有人能够听见。

"Yui... it took me so long to finally understand you. At first it thought that it was the accident that took you away for me and I've been patiently waiting for the day when I would see you again and finally get what I wanted.  
“结衣...我花了这么久才终于理解你。起初，我以为是你遭遇的意外将你从我身边夺走，我一直耐心等待着再次见到你的那一天，最终得到我想要的。”

But it was a foolish hope. You are not at fault, of course. You've always did what you wanted to do and that was different than what I desired. I've grown to understand and appreciate what you've done, even if I don't like it. As the old saying goes, beauty is the child of love, I guess.  
“但那只是个愚蠢的希望。当然，这不是你的错。你总是做你想做的事，这与我所期望的不同。我已逐渐理解并欣赏你所做的一切，即使我不喜欢。正如老话所说，美是爱的孩子，我想。”

Even so, I am happy to say that, as much as your plan was successful and brilliant, you might have been wrong.  
“即便如此，我仍要高兴地说，尽管你的计划成功且出色，你可能错了。”

Right now, another Evangelion, created from Adam, is using the energy from the S2 engine to leave this planet for the stars.  
此刻，另一架由亚当制造的 EVA 正利用 S2 引擎的能量，离开地球，向着星空进发。

Sure, this Evangelion does not even compare to the perfection of your Unit 01, it is just a pale imitation of the original. One more imperfect copy and attempt of copying you, like many others tried.  
当然，这台 EVA 远不及你的零一机那般完美，它不过是原版的苍白模仿。又是一次不完美的复制尝试，就像许多人曾尝试过的那样。

And besides, at its core are now two souls cohabiting it. We both know that is statistically unlikely that they will be able coexist in that state for all eternity. In the most likely scenario, one of them will destroy the other completely.  
而且，其核心如今容纳着两个灵魂共存。我们都知道，从统计学角度来看，它们能永远以这种状态共存的可能性微乎其微。最有可能的情况是，其中一个将彻底摧毁另一个。

Because of this, even possessing the fruit of life is not likely to endure to the end of time as a testimony to human history. They seem to be doomed to fail at their task and be forgotten forever.  
正因如此，即便拥有生命之果，也未必能作为人类历史的见证，永远流传至时间尽头。他们似乎注定要在这项任务上失败，并永远被遗忘。

However, I'm sure that they will try to bridge the gap between dreams and reality. They will bleed blood tears, because they believe that they are meant for one another. And they would fight until the end to prove it. To prove that you were wrong.  
然而，我确信他们会试图弥合梦境与现实之间的鸿沟。他们会流下血泪，因为他们相信彼此命中注定。他们将战斗到底，以证明这一点。证明你错了。

Even if the chances of survival are slim, miracles do happen after all. Maybe this imperfect Evangelion will be a better testimony to humanity than your perfect project, Yui.  
即使生存的希望渺茫，奇迹毕竟还是存在的。也许这台不完美的 EVA，会比你的完美计划更能成为人类的见证，Yui。

Children of humanity, born from Lilith, coexisting within the spawn of Adam... this really is an extremely fragile balance, but, precisely because of this, it is a more faithful representation of the human will to defy fate and try to seek happiness and survive, even under the most terrible circumstances.  
人类之子，由莉莉丝而生，共存于亚当的后裔之中……这真是一种极其脆弱的平衡，但正因为如此，它更忠实地体现了人类反抗命运、在最恶劣的环境下也要寻求幸福和生存的意志。

What makes this imperfect Eva so special is that it will be driven to the end not by a single will, but by different and separated human hearts. The existence of another heart is what allows each human being in this world to recognize their own selves from their interactions with others, and, thus, each individual has the choice between love and hate.  
这部不完美的 EVA 之所以特别，是因为它将由不同的、分离的人心驱动至终点，而非单一意志。正是另一颗心的存在，使得这个世界上的每个人通过与他人的互动来认识自我，从而每个人都在爱与恨之间拥有选择。

In fact, imperfection is the true constant of human nature and the eternal struggle between struggling to accept those imperfections and always continuing to evolve and improve is the great testimony that humanity has to offer to this universe.  
事实上，不完美是人类本性的真实常态，在不断挣扎接受这些不完美与持续进化改进之间的永恒斗争，是人类向这个宇宙提供的伟大证明。

This is the path that those pilots chose. That was the path that Shinji chose, Yui. And that was a path that we could have chosen as well.  
这是那些驾驶员选择的道路。那是真嗣选择的道路，唯。那也是我们本可以选择的道路。

And this is something that I will remember forever, and I know that you will too."  
这将是我永远铭记的事情，我知道你也会如此。

Gendo began to hear sounds approaching and quickly understood that Unit 02 had already left the planet. Therefore, he would have no way to escape his fate. His doublethink maneuvers wouldn't help him now. Kiru, Samuel, Shark and other new agents would soon arrive to arrest him for good. And there is no way to slip out of this situation.  
源堂开始听到接近的声音，并迅速意识到二号机已经离开了地球。因此，他将无法逃脱自己的命运。他的双重思维策略现在帮不了他。库鲁、塞缪尔、鲨鱼和其他新特工很快就会来逮捕他。他无法摆脱这种局面。

He would have to give explanations to all those involved in his project and would be forced to accept the punishments he would certainly receive for having allocated precious time and resources from a destroyed world for his project that, in the end, will not cause any change in the world. Only few people will know about it and what he true wanted to accomplish,  
他不得不向所有参与他项目的人做出解释，并被迫接受他肯定会因从毁灭的世界中分配宝贵时间和资源用于一个最终不会对世界产生任何改变的项目而受到的惩罚。只有少数人会知道这件事以及他真正想要达成的目标。

Turning toward the door to face his fate, Gendo continued to speak in a lower and lower voice.  
转向门口面对自己的命运，源渡继续用越来越低的声音说道。

"I... accept your choice, Yui. And like the rest of humanity, I will accept being in a world in which there are no more Evangelions, but without ever forgetting that they have been here and all that they have had an effect on humanity."  
“我……接受你的选择，唯。就像人类的其他成员一样，我将接受一个不再有福音战士的世界，但永远不会忘记它们曾经存在过以及它们对人类产生的影响。”

Humanity owes a lot to you, Yui. After all, despite all the difficulties, you managed to finish your project and turn your work as a testament to humanity in a way that will surely stand the test of time. Your inheritance to mankind and the universe. That cruel thesis for this beautiful world.  
人类欠你很多，唯。毕竟，尽管困难重重，你还是完成了你的项目，并以一种必将经受时间考验的方式，将你的工作作为人类的见证。你对人类和宇宙的遗产。对这个美丽世界的残酷论文。

As for me, there is nothing left to do. I will face my fate in this world without Evangelions and without the prospect that I will meet you again someday. And even if we do meet again, I know it will never be the same as it was before. After all, what else is there for the two of us?"  
至于我，已经没有什么可做的了。我将在这个没有福音战士、也没有再见到你的希望的世界里面对我的命运。即使我们真的再次相遇，我知道那也永远不会像以前那样。毕竟，我们两个人还有什么呢？

He stared at the door and gave a small sigh before making the decision to open it.  
他盯着门，轻轻叹了口气，然后决定打开它。

"But before I leave, I have to tell you these last words, Yui... you've failed. Evangelion will survive forever as a testimony that humanity existed… but it will not be only yours Evangelion.  
但在我离开之前，我必须告诉你这些最后的遗言，唯...你失败了。《EVA》将作为人类存在的见证永远流传...但它将不再只是你的《EVA》。

Even if you are no longer here and your history with Evangelion is over, humanity will not forget that Eva existed and eventually someone will try to recreate them again.  
即使你已不在，你与《EVA》的历史已成过去，人类也不会忘记 EVA 的存在，终有一天会有人试图再次重现它们。

After all... you can erase something from your mind. Getting it out of your heart is another story."  
毕竟...你可以从脑海中抹去某些事物。但要将其从心中抹除，则是另一回事。

The train station was very busy on that day. Thousands of people must have passed through it. But, since early morning, an elderly man was sitting on a bench in the station, watching the movement with a contemplative gaze.  
那天火车站异常繁忙，成千上万的人必定穿梭其间。但从一大早开始，一位老者就坐在车站的长椅上，以沉思的目光注视着来往的人群。

Until he felt something hard tap him lightly on the head. A very familiar cane.  
直到他感觉到有什么硬物轻轻敲打在他的头上。一根非常熟悉的拐杖。

"Hey old geezer, do you really have nothing better to do than stay here all morning?"  
“嘿，老伙计，你真的没有比在这里坐一上午更有趣的事可做了吗？”

"I've already told you to stop calling me an old geezer, remember? After all I'm just six months older than you."  
"我已经告诉过你别再叫我老头子了，记得吗？毕竟我只比你大六个月而已。"

"Yeah, but you're still an old geezer who is lucky to have a pretty lady like me to take care of you."  
"是啊，但你还是个幸运的老头子，有我这么漂亮的女士照顾你。"

"Would this pretty lady give me the honor of sitting here by my side?"  
"这位漂亮的女士愿意赏光坐在我身边吗？"

"Oh… you've always been a pervert. I hope that you weren't using those lame pick up lines to every slut that passes by near you."  
"哦……你一直这么色。希望你没用那些蹩脚的搭讪台词对每个经过你身边的荡妇都说一遍。"

"Nah… only to my dearest honey." – he said with a smile as the old lady sat down by his side.  
""没有啦……只对我最亲爱的宝贝。"" ——他笑着说，这时那位老太太在他身边坐下。

"Ugh, my diabetes…. And my back. Getting old sucks."  
"呃，我的糖尿病……还有我的背。变老真是糟透了。"

"Well, there are some things that time gave us, you know."  
"嗯，有些东西是时间赋予我们的，你知道的。"

"Like what?" "比如呢？"

"Memories." "回忆。"

"Heh… you are really feeling extra corny today, huh?"  
"呵呵…你今天真是格外感性啊，是不是？"

"In fact, I was remembering those days when we were living alone in the world and had to sleep under the moonlight until we found that shelter. It was kinda romantic, you know? We were laying there, just like two young stargazers…"  
"事实上，我想起了那些日子，那时我们独自生活在这个世界上，不得不睡在月光下，直到我们找到那个避难所。你知道吗，那有点浪漫？我们躺在那里，就像两个年轻的观星者……"

"Or like two potheads. A dilemma, huh? It's like I told you on that day: until the booze do us part."  
"或者像两个瘾君子。真是个难题，对吧？就像那天我告诉你的：直到酒尽人散。"

He just laughed at his wife's sarcastic response and lack of romanticism. They just stared at the movement of the train station for a few minutes.  
他只是对他的妻子那讽刺的回答和缺乏浪漫主义笑了笑。他们只是盯着火车站的动静，沉默了几分钟。

"Hey old geezer… do you miss the days of being a pilot?"  
"嘿，老伙计……怀念当飞行员的日子吗？"

"What? No, no… I'm ok with using the public transport. I never liked driving that much."  
"什么？不，不……我挺满意坐公共交通的。我从来就不怎么喜欢开车。"

She threw a mildly annoyed glare at him looking for a trace of irony in his face and, when she found none, her face softened and she spoke with a soft voice.  
她向他投去略带恼怒的一瞥，试图在他脸上找到一丝讽刺的痕迹，但当她发现没有时，她的表情缓和下来，用柔和的声音说道。

"Idiot. I'm talking about Eva, you know… right?"  
"傻瓜。我说的是伊娃，你知道的……对吧？"

He looked at her in astonishment and after a few seconds smiled slightly.  
他惊讶地看着她，几秒钟后微微一笑。

"Sorry…. I think I forgot about it."  
"抱歉……我想我忘了这事。"

The woman got up in a rather sudden movement and grabbed the man by the shirt collar.  
女人突然站起身，猛地抓住了男人的衬衫领子。

"You are joking right? After being trapped in Eva for so long… how can you have forgotten about that?"  
“你在开玩笑吧？被困在 Eva 里那么久……你怎么可能忘了那件事？”

"I… I don't know…. I think I… life has just keep going on and stopped to think about it. It's just not important anymore, I guess"  
“我……我不知道……我想我……生活一直在继续，就没再去想它。大概已经不重要了吧。”

She looked at him with concerned eyes.  
她用关切的眼神看着他。

"Do… do you think you will also…"  
"你…你觉得你也会…"

He looked at her and softly pushed her hands away from his shirt collar, giving a soft kiss on her left hand, near the ring that he had gave her a long time ago.  
他看着她，轻轻推开她抓着他衬衫领子的手，在她左手靠近戒指的地方温柔地吻了一下，那枚戒指是他很久以前送给她的。

They looked at each other for a while and the concern in her eyes turned into contentment and understanding.  
他们彼此凝视良久，她眼中的担忧化为了满足与理解。

Their communication was perfect. No words where needed. Even if they grow get, sick or even if they forget about everything else, the story that they had lived together will be preserved.  
他们的交流完美无缺，无需言语。即便他们变老、生病，甚至忘却其他一切，共同经历的故事将永存于心。

That's why only one thought crossed their minds at that moment:  
正因如此，那一刻他们心中只掠过一个念头：

**"We will never forget." “我们永志不忘。”**

**AUTHOR NOTES 作者笔记**

Almost 15 years ago I watched an amazing AMV by More Than Toast that consists in a parody of the trailer from the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with Shinji and Asuka as Joel and Clementine (the main characters of the movie) and thought about writing a fan fiction about it.  
大约 15 年前，我观看了一个由 More Than Toast 制作的精彩 AMV，该视频模仿了电影《美丽心灵的永恒阳光》的预告片，以真嗣和明日香分别扮演电影中的乔尔和克莱门汀（电影的主角），这激发了我写一篇相关同人小说的想法。

Now that the Rebuild's are finished and I've made a decision to return to interact online with people from the fanfiction community and Eva fandom, I've decided to develop this old idea of mine in a different way, using elements from the plot of the original movie and also themes several themes of Asushin lore developed in canon and fan works.  
如今《新世纪福音战士》重制版系列已完结，我决定重返网络，与同人小说社区和 EVA 粉丝圈互动，因此我决定以不同的方式发展这个旧想法，结合原电影的情节元素以及在正典和粉丝作品中发展的诸多 Asushin（真嗣与明日香）主题。

So, a lot of scenes made here are shout-outs or adaptations from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, especially in the prologue, and also several scenes and dialogues that are extracted or adapted from several different sources of Evangelion related works (from canon and fandom).  
因此，这里许多场景都是对《美丽心灵的永恒阳光》的致敬或改编，尤其是在序章中，还有从多个《新世纪福音战士》相关作品（包括正史和同人）中提取或改编的若干场景和对话。

Those were mixed into the story in a way that (hopefully) wasn't noticed by readers who haven't see those works and also made the reading more interesting by those who understood the references.  
这些元素以一种（希望）未被未看过这些作品的读者察觉的方式融入故事，同时也让理解这些引用的读者阅读起来更加有趣。

I've selected a bunch of fanfictions and artists from past, present and future - with the "Asushin kind of hope" that the works that are still in progress will not be abandoned - following some criteria (for example, no fics that are pure or primarily lemon), but I never intended to make a list or something like that.  
我挑选了一系列过去、现在和未来的同人小说和艺术家，怀着“明日香和真嗣那种希望”，希望那些仍在进行中的作品不会被放弃，遵循一些标准（例如，不包括纯或主要为色情内容的作品），但我从未打算制作一个清单或类似的东西。

For sure there are also other great artists and fanfictions about Asushin that are really good, but didn't make into this story for a bunch of reasons, mostly because I didn't know about that from the start, forgot about them (shame on me) or considered, but haven't found a way to properly insert them into the story. So, any relevant omission can be blamed on me ^^.  
当然，还有许多其他伟大的艺术家和关于 Asushin 的优秀同人文，但由于种种原因未能纳入本故事，主要是因为我一开始并不知情，或是忘记了它们（我真该打），又或是考虑过但未能找到合适的方式将其融入故事。因此，任何相关的遗漏都应归咎于我^^。

The goal with the plot and all those references was to make a story that would be interesting and fun to the new fans and to the old-time fans that have helped to build this Asushin lore during all those years. I don't know if I succeeded, but that was the intent, at least. :)  
本故事的情节和所有这些引用旨在为新粉丝和多年来帮助构建 Asushin 传说的老粉丝创造一个既有趣又引人入胜的故事。我不知道是否成功，但至少这是我的初衷。 :)

This story is already finished, but I decided to make this epilogue to add further details of the conclusion of the story and those extensive author notes explaining all the easter eggs and the shoutouts to several Asushin related works, thoughts about the meta references and also some thoughts about Asushin in general.  
这个故事已经完结，但我决定制作这个尾声，以添加更多关于故事结局的细节，以及那些详尽的作者注释，解释所有的彩蛋和向多个 Asushin 相关作品的致敬，对元引用的思考，以及对 Asushin 的一些总体思考。

Finally, I wish to say thanks for all the writers, artists, readers and all people that have helped to build and develop Evangelion - and especially Asushin - lore thorough those 25 years.  
最后，我想对过去 25 年来所有为构建和发展《新世纪福音战士》——尤其是明日香与真嗣——的传说付出努力的作家、艺术家、读者及各界人士表示感谢。

And also special thanks to all the kind people from the Asushin subreddit - a nice place where I was able to have many interesting discussions and conversations about Evangelion, which made me understand a lot more about Shinji and Asuka in the past few months – and the great fanfiction authors from Asushin discord server, especially fellow author YourBlandestNightmare, who had kindly reviewed and helped to fix (a lot of) grammar mistakes and inspired me to finally turn this old idea into something concrete.  
同时，特别感谢 Asushin subreddit 上的热心朋友们，那是一个让我能进行许多关于《新世纪福音战士》的有趣讨论和交流的美好地方，让我在过去几个月里对真嗣和明日香有了更深的理解；还有 Asushin discord 服务器上的优秀同人作者们，特别是同行作者 YourBlandestNightmare，他/她慷慨地审阅并修正（许多）语法错误，激励我将这个旧想法最终转化为具体作品。

Hope you have enjoyed the ride.  
希望您享受这段旅程。

And this is definitely not the end of the line for me.  
而这绝对不是我故事的终点。

Ironically, the last movie of the Rebuilds taught me a valuable lesson: you don't need to abandon, move on or feel guilty for enjoying things you like. It's possible to find balance with everything in life. So, I decided that won't ever retire from fanfiction writing, although right now I will only make short one-shots and funny stuff.  
讽刺的是，《新世纪福音战士》系列的最后一部电影教会了我一个宝贵的人生课程：你不必为了享受自己喜欢的事物而感到内疚或放弃。在生活中找到平衡是可能的。因此，我决定永远不会从同人小说创作中退休，尽管目前我只会写一些短篇和有趣的东西。

But I hope to be alive and well and able to make a Rebuild of this story in 2046, to celebrate 50 years of Asushin with plenty of new content to explore.  
但我希望到 2046 年，我能健康地活着，并能创作出这个故事的新版本，以庆祝碇真嗣和绫波零的 50 周年纪念，并带来大量新内容供大家探索。

So, let's go to the notes and trivia:  
那么，让我们来看看注释和趣闻：

**1)** **I'm still kinda lost with this story. What the hell happened?**  
1) 我对这个故事还是有点摸不着头脑。到底发生了什么？

The story was told in a non-linear order of the events, like the movie Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind.  
故事采用了非线性的事件顺序叙述，就像电影《暖暖内含光》那样。

The chronological order of the events starts with the "If I Can't Be Yours"/ "Everything you ever dreamed" chapters, that tells us – in flashbacks - the events that happened with them before the events of "Kimochi Warui"/ "Unfamiliar Ceiling". After those events, we have the prologue "Mustn't Runaway Train" chapter taking place and, after that, "All is Right with The World" happens.  
事件的时间顺序始于“如果我不能成为你的”/“你所梦想的一切”章节，这些章节通过闪回向我们讲述了在“讨厌的感觉”/“陌生的天花板”事件之前他们之间发生的事情。这些事件之后，我们有了“绝不能逃避列车”的序章，随后是“一切都是美好的”发生。

But the story can also be read from Asuka's and/or Shinji's perspective:  
但故事也可以从明日香和/或真嗣的视角来阅读：

Asuka's route is: Kimochi Warui - Mustn't Runaway Train - If I Can't Be Yours - All is Right with The World.  
明日香的路线是：讨厌的感觉 - 绝不能逃避列车 - 如果我不能成为你的 - 一切都是美好的。

And Shinji's route is: Unfamiliar Ceiling - Mustn't Runaway Train - Everything you ever dreamed - All is Right with The World.  
而真嗣的路线是：陌生的天花板 - 不可逃避的列车 - 你所有梦想的一切 - 世界一切都好。

Hopefully, reading the story in those three different ways – for those ones who won't mind in doing so - will offer a different and more complete experience.  
希望以这三种不同的方式阅读故事——对于那些不介意这样做的人——能提供一种不同且更完整的体验。

**2)** **Still not enough. Care to explain?**  
2) 仍然不够。愿意解释一下吗？

Sure. The story starts at the final scene of EoE. Shinji and Asuka had a small conversation at the beach and then decided to try to survive until more people came back.  
当然。故事始于《EVA》最终场景。真嗣和明日香在海滩上进行了简短的对话，随后决定尝试生存下去，直到更多人归来。

They managed to find shelter and lived alone with each other for several weeks, but had a troubled relationship, because they both know everything (the good, the bad and the ugly) about the other.  
他们设法找到了避难所，独自相处了数周，但关系并不融洽，因为他们彼此都深知对方的所有（好的、坏的以及丑陋的）。

In one of those nights, they had a discussion and Asuka leaves the shelter. Since those two have the worst luck in the world, after that night they both got captured by the JSSDF that had returned from Instrumentality and are taken as prisoners.  
某个夜晚，他们进行了一场讨论，明日香离开了避难所。由于这两人的运气糟糕透顶，那晚之后，他们都被从人类补完计划归来的日本自卫队（JSSDF）俘获，成了囚犯。

Fortunately, not all JSSDF returnees hated them or wanted to kill them on spot, especially after the events of Instrumentality. Yadoraki and others ensured that they were treated well, even if being kept apart from each other for months.  
幸运的是，并非所有从 JSSDF 归来的成员都憎恨他们或想当场杀死他们，尤其是在人类补完计划事件之后。矢多里和其他人确保他们受到良好对待，即便被分开数月之久。

When Maya came back, Shinji got the courage to write a letter to Asuka and asked Maya to deliver it for him. Asuka got the letter and asked Maya to move her to a cell that was adjacent to Shinji's cell. They had some nice conversations, Shinji got a cello and they got to spend some months in that situation where they were able to talk, but no see each other. So close, but too far.  
当真嗣回来时，碇真嗣鼓起勇气写了一封信给明日香，并请真希波转交。明日香收到信后，请求真希波将她转移到与真嗣相邻的牢房。他们进行了一些愉快的对话，真嗣得到了一把大提琴，他们得以在那种情况下共度数月，能够交谈却无法相见。如此接近，却又遥不可及。

Meanwhile, Gendo Ikari, who was one of the fist persons to return to live, gathered the remaining pieces of Eva 02 and managed to send them to Euronerv quarters, in Germany. He also convinced the new governments that restoring the Evangelion and imbuing it with an artificial S2 engine would be necessary to mankind's survival. So, people from Euronerv worked on rebuild Eva 02, which they were able to do in a matter of months, since they were the one's who had build it in the first place.  
与此同时，碇源堂是首批回归生活的人之一，他收集了剩余的 EVA 02 部件，并设法将其送往德国的 Euronerv 分部。他还说服了新政府，重建 EVA 并为其植入人工 S2 引擎对人类的生存至关重要。因此，Euronerv 的人员着手重建 EVA 02，由于他们原本就是建造者，仅用数月便完成了这项任务。

Since the Eva needed a pilot to be activated because there was no way to rebuild the Dummy System, Euronerv staff asked for Japan to send Asuka back, which triggered an important diplomatic issue. Yadoraki was reluctant, but decided to give that decision to Asuka.  
由于 Eva 需要一名驾驶员才能启动，因为无法重建模拟系统，Euronerv 的工作人员请求日本将明日香送回，这引发了一个重要的外交问题。矢吹真吾虽然不情愿，但还是决定将这个决定交给明日香。

She thought about it for a while and decided to return and pilot Eva, because, by doing that, she would've been able to change their current situation and spare Shinji of the burden to pilot Evangelion again. She left, without saying goodbye to him.  
她思考了一会儿，决定返回并驾驶 Eva，因为这样做，她就能改变他们目前的状况，并让真嗣免于再次承担驾驶 Evangelion 的重担。她离开了，没有向他告别。

In Euronerv, some older people like Amelie and Avil had already worked with Asuka while she was being trained to be a pilot, and vowed to take care of the girl.  
在 Euronerv，像阿梅丽和阿维尔这样的一些年长者，已经在明日香接受飞行员训练期间与她共事过，并承诺会照顾这个女孩。

However, Gendo tricked them and managed to do a contact experiment to splice Asuka's soul, sending a part of her soul to the Evangelion core, resulting in giving her partial amnesia. But, even by doing so, the experiment wasn't a full success: the Evangelion was functional, but the S2 engine wasn't, because it lacked more pieces of Unit 02 Eva core.  
然而，源渡欺骗了他们，设法进行了一次接触实验，试图拼接明日香的灵魂，将她的一部分灵魂送入 EVA 核心，结果导致她部分失忆。但即便如此，实验并未完全成功：EVA 虽然能运作，但 S2 引擎却无法启动，因为它缺少了更多二号机核心的部件。

After the incident, Amelie and Avil, managed to understand Gendo's plan – to control the Eva and S2 engine to rule the world and, probably, try to get Eva 01 and Yui back from space - and created a plan: Amelie would make sure that Asuka would survive and Avil went, with several trusted agents, in a suicide mission to tell Yadoraki about the plan and all the info about the research.  
事件发生后，阿梅丽和阿维尔设法理解了源渡的计划——控制 EVA 和 S2 引擎以统治世界，并可能试图从太空中找回初号机和唯——他们制定了一个计划：阿梅丽确保明日香能够存活，而阿维尔则带领几名可靠的特工执行自杀任务，向矢多里传达计划及所有研究信息。

After Yadoraki got the message, he searched for the aid of Yuko and Jima to try to create a weapon able to stop the reborn Unit 02 in the battlefield. The only possible solution was to use the old Jet Alone, but try to switch the AI system to a human piloted system, using the remaining pieces of the old Unit 02 core, to make it able to generate an AT-Field.  
矢多里收到消息后，寻求优子和吉马的帮助，试图制造一种能在战场上阻止重生二号机的武器。唯一可行的解决方案是利用旧的 Jet Alone，但尝试将 AI 系统切换为人控系统，利用剩余的旧二号机核心部件，使其能够生成 AT 力场。

While Nerv Japan and the JSSDF where trying to run against the time to build the new weapon, Asuka's health and overall condition was getting worse, because of the contact experiment, and she was starting to lose her humanity and her mind, just like her mother. Still, she was deployed in the battle field several times, but Amelie made sure that she would only be deployed to activate her AT-Field, which was enough to ensure military supremacy in the battlefield while avoiding to expose her and Unit 02 to danger.  
当日本 NERV 和 JSSDF 争分夺秒地制造新武器时，由于接触实验，明日香的身心状况日益恶化，她开始失去人性与理智，如同她的母亲一般。尽管如此，她仍多次被派遣上战场，但阿梅莉确保她仅在激活 AT 力场时才被部署，这足以确保战场上的军事优势，同时避免她和二号机陷入危险。

During that time, Shinji wrote 52 letters to Asuka and was unaware of what was happening. Until the weapon was finished and he was informed about Asuka's destiny and everything that happened. After an enormous outburst, Shinji agreed to fight for Asuka's sake, and went under the contact experiment, splitting his soul to activate the renewed and improved Jet Alone, becoming partially amnesic too.  
在那段时间里，真嗣给明日香写了 52 封信，对发生的一切浑然不觉。直到武器完成，他被告知明日香的命运及所有经过。在巨大的情绪爆发后，真嗣为了明日香决定参战，并接受了接触实验，分裂灵魂以激活改良后的 Jet Alone，也因此部分失忆。

So, the day of the confront came when Euronerv's forces, leaded by Gendo, managed to overrule Amelie's authority and deployed Asuka and Unit 02 to the battlefield, to fight against Shinji in the renewed Jet Alone.  
于是，对决之日到来，欧洲 NERV 部队在碇源堂的领导下，成功推翻了阿梅莉的权威，将明日香和二号机部署到战场，与真嗣驾驶的改良版 Jet Alone 展开对抗。

Both of them didn't remember anything about the other, but had some flashbacks during the battle. At the end of the battle, Unit 02 batteries dried-out and the Jet Alone get the upper hand when Shinji reached over 100% synch rate, but refused to finish the battle. Unit 02 went berserk, with Asuka also breaking the 100% synch rate barrier, and ripped the core tissue that was implanted in the Jet Alone – including Shinji's entry plug, and tried to merge it within its own core, resulting in an uncontrolled activation of the S2 engine.  
两人都对对方毫无记忆，但在战斗中有些闪回。战斗结束时，二号机的电池耗尽，Jet Alone 趁机占据上风，此时真嗣的同步率突破了 100%，却拒绝结束战斗。二号机陷入狂暴，明日香也打破了 100%同步率的屏障，撕裂了植入 Jet Alone 的核心组织——包括真嗣的插入栓，并试图将其融合进自身核心，导致 S2 引擎的失控激活。

That created a Dirac Sea, that engulfed the Unit 02 and the Jet Alone. This event lasted only a few seconds in the real world, but it was a hole different experience for Shinji and Asuka.  
这创造了一个吞噬二号机和 Jet Alone 的狄拉克海。这一事件在现实世界中仅持续了几秒钟，但对真嗣和明日香来说，却是一次截然不同的体验。

Since they both had lost their physical forms due to the high synch rate, their amnesic selves, formed by their damaged and incomplete souls, found each other in a train that was created by their imagination.  
由于高同步率导致他们失去了肉体形态，他们因灵魂受损而不完整的失忆自我，在由他们想象创造的列车上相遇了。

Their interactions on the train managed to push them deeper into the Evangelion's cores, which contained the remaining pieces of their souls. They both got the remaining of their souls attached back into them, which made they recover their lost memories.  
他们在列车上的互动成功地将他们推向了 EVA 的核心深处，那里封存着他们灵魂的残片。两人都重新融合了灵魂的剩余部分，这使得他们恢复了失去的记忆。

After that, their collective imagination put the two of them on an imaginary beach, also inside of the Evangelion core. There, they realized their situation and decided, after a little dramatic conversation, that they would not return to their human forms and, instead, would try to control the Evangelion, together, in their current state, to avoid causing the expansion of the Dirac Sea and another end of the world event.  
之后，他们的集体想象将两人带到了 EVA 核心内的一个虚构海滩。在那里，他们意识到了自己的处境，并在一番戏剧性的对话后决定，不再回归人类形态，而是尝试以当前状态共同控制 EVA，以避免引发狄拉克海扩张和世界末日的再次发生。

Then, the complete Unit 02 with a functional S2 engine ripped apart the Dirac Sea and used that energy to escape Earth's gravity, being launched into the space, while Gendo observed it and waited his punishment, since his final attempt of being with Yui was frustrated once again.  
随后，装备了功能性 S2 引擎的完整零二号机撕裂了狄拉克海，利用那股能量摆脱了地球引力，被发射进入太空，而碇源堂则在一旁观察，等待着他的惩罚，因为他与唯团聚的最后尝试再次受挫。

The destiny of Shinji and Asuka - trapped in Unit 02 - or of the humanity, trying to rebuild the world from the events of Third Impact, is unknown.  
真嗣和明日香——被困在二号机内——或是人类试图从第三次冲击事件中重建世界的命运，仍是个未知数。

**3) What about the epilogue's final scene? Were they trapped forever inside the Eva or did they managed to get out of it and go back into the real world?  
3) 那结局的最后一幕呢？他们是永远被困在 EVA 里，还是设法逃脱并回到了现实世界？**

This is a trick I learned from Hideaki Anno. Always leave the final scene ambiguous and open for different interpretations :)  
这是我从庵野秀明那里学到的技巧。总是让最后一幕保持模糊和开放，供人不同解读 :)

**4) Why write this story and why so much meta (even cringe) references?  
4) 为何要写这个故事，又为何包含如此多的元（甚至令人尴尬）引用？**

This story was created as an homage to all the Evangelion fandom and, above all, to the fans who contributed with the production of fanfictions, fanarts, doujins and various posts in forums and social networks throughout all these 25 years of existence of the franchise.  
这个故事是为了向所有《新世纪福音战士》粉丝致敬，尤其是那些在过去 25 年里，通过创作同人小说、同人艺术、同人志以及在论坛和社交网络上发表各种帖子，为这一系列的发展做出贡献的粉丝们。

Despite some of them may seem outdated and even silly nowadays, all of them contributed to the creation of new worlds, insights and expansion of the ideas of the original work, making the franchise even more interesting, current and alive, exploring and enriching the paths that Hideaki Anno and the other creators of the franchise traced.  
尽管其中一些内容在今天看来可能已经过时甚至有些愚蠢，但它们都为创造新世界、新见解以及扩展原作思想做出了贡献，使得这一系列更加有趣、贴近时代且充满活力，探索并丰富了庵野秀明和其他系列创作者所描绘的路径。

Evangelion had not ended in 2021. It had ended in 1997, but has been kept alive during all those years because it's a timeless tale that is able to touch fans from past, present and future.  
《新世纪福音战士》并未在 2021 年落幕。它在 1997 年便已完结，但多年来一直被保留下来，因为它是一个永恒的故事，能够触动过去、现在和未来的粉丝。

Therefore, even if there will be no more official releases about Evangelion (a thing that I doubt, especially because after several interviews and dumb Youtube videos about "Goodbye Evangelion" and "Evangelion has ended" we had the release of Eva Extra Manga, Shinkalion collaboration event and several new merch and even official arts) and the fans and the world eventually get Evangelion out of their minds, Eva would always have a place in our hearts.  
因此，即使不再有关于《新世纪福音战士》的官方发布（我对此表示怀疑，尤其是在经历了多次关于“再见，福音战士”和“福音战士已完结”的采访和愚蠢的 YouTube 视频后，我们迎来了《福音战士》额外漫画、新干线合作活动以及多款新商品甚至官方艺术作品的发布），当粉丝们和世界最终将《福音战士》从脑海中抹去时，它仍将永远占据我们心中的一席之地。

And, because of that, it will never die.  
正因如此，它永远不会消逝。

**5) Why Shinji and Asuka? Why Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind?  
5) 为何选择真嗣和明日香？为何是《暖暖内含光》？**

I watched Neon Genesis Evangelion back in the 90's, when my young age and my life dilemmas at the time made me identify with Shinji and Asuka's dramas, especially regarding family issues and expectations from older people.  
我在 90 年代观看了《新世纪福音战士》，那时年轻的我和生活中的困境让我与真嗣和明日香的戏剧产生了共鸣，尤其是关于家庭问题和来自长辈的期望。

After having returned to writing fanfictions with a small short story after the end of the last Rebuilds movie, I didn't expect that I would return once again to write a story with so many words and in a foreign language.  
在最后一部《福音战士新剧场版》结束后，我以一篇短篇小说重新开始创作同人作品，没想到我会再次用这么多文字和外语来写一个故事。

But I felt that there was still something bothering me that I wanted to share with the world, and so I returned for another round after years of inactivity (yes, another reference, this time to the "Rocky Balboa" movie).  
但我感觉还有些困扰我的事情想要与世人分享，于是在多年沉寂之后我又回来了（没错，又一次致敬，这次是《洛奇·巴尔博亚》电影）。

This fanfiction was originally intended as a traditional one-shot, based on the movie Etern**a**l **Su**n**shin**e of the Spotless Mind (the first easter egg, in fact, is the word Asushin that hidden in the title of the movie) and in the aforementioned AMV, extremely well done, which makes a parody of Evangelion with the trailer for this movie, placing Shinji as Joel and Asuka as Clementine.  
这篇同人小说原本打算作为传统的一发完结篇，灵感源自电影《暖暖内含光》（实际上，第一个彩蛋就是电影标题中隐藏的“明日香”这个词），并且在上述极为出色的 AMV 中，以该电影预告片的形式对《新世纪福音战士》进行了恶搞，将真嗣设定为乔尔，明日香设定为克莱门汀。

In reviewing the film, I realized many parallels between Joel and Clementine's story and Shinji and Asuka's story: in both stories the possibility of romance and the love between the couple was still there, but this possibility was buried by a series of hurts and wrong decisions that made their relationship such a source of suffering that there seemed to be no way back. But in the end, both Joel and Clementine and Shinji and Asuka were given a new chance to try again, through extraordinary events. Even though it is a small chance and no guarantee of success, the attempt is worth it.  
在回顾这部电影时，我意识到乔尔和克莱门汀的故事与真嗣和明日香的故事之间有许多相似之处：在两个故事中，爱情的萌芽和情侣间的爱意依然存在，但这一可能性被一系列伤害和错误决定所掩埋，使得他们的关系成为痛苦的源泉，似乎无法回头。但最终，无论是乔尔和克莱门汀，还是真嗣和明日香，都通过非凡的事件获得了重新尝试的机会。尽管机会渺茫且无法保证成功，但尝试本身是值得的。

And this is why stories involving complicated relationships, like Shinji and Asuka's, in which feelings of attraction and love coexist with feelings of frustration and hatred, are stories worth telling.  
这就是为什么涉及复杂关系的故事，比如真嗣和明日香之间的那种，其中吸引与爱意与挫败和憎恨并存，是值得讲述的故事。

Ultimately, I believe that as we write or think about these stories about fictional characters to ultimately try to put our own ideas and thoughts in order in relation to ourselves.  
归根结底，我相信我们在创作或思考这些关于虚构人物的故事时，最终目的是为了整理我们自己的想法和思绪。

I really agree with the famous quote from Rich Burlew: "Fantasy literature is ONLY worthwhile for what it can tell us about the real world; everything else is petty escapism."  
我非常赞同里奇·伯勒姆那句名言：“奇幻文学的价值仅在于它对我们现实世界的启示；其他一切都只是琐碎的逃避现实。”

When thinking about the relationship between Shinji and Asuka, especially from the scenario after the end of End of Evangelion - rather than the complex and deep discussions about how and if the final scene invokes a representation about the acceptance and recognition of the "other" through Hegel's master-slave dialectic - the context and concept of that ending always urged me to think of both characters as "equal and opposite" at the same time ("one, but not the same"), as two sides of the same coin, yin -yang.  
在思考真嗣和明日香之间的关系时，尤其是从《新世纪福音战士》剧场版结局后的情境出发——而非深入探讨最终场景是否通过黑格尔的主奴辩证法来象征对“他者”的接纳与认同——这一结局的背景与概念总让我将两位角色视为“既平等又对立”（“一体，但不相同”），如同同一枚硬币的两面，阴阳相生。

Thus, the mental exercise of thinking of ways to restore balance to the minds of these broken teenagers on a journey in which through understanding and connection between them it is possible to find something beyond suffering, but an evolution so that they can find peace with their own demons.  
因此，通过思考如何在这段旅程中恢复这两个心灵受创少年的平衡，成为一种精神上的锻炼。在这段旅程中，通过他们之间的理解和连接，有可能超越痛苦，实现一种进化，使他们能与内心的恶魔和平共处。

In this respect, the expression "I need you" at the end of EoE is again ambiguous as to whether this need is romantic or one of dependence, but it is an extremely apt expression. From this need, good and evil can arise.  
就此而言，《EoE》结尾处的“我需要你”这一表达再次显得模棱两可，不确定这种需求是出于浪漫情感还是依赖性，但它却是一个极为贴切的表述。从这种需求中，善与恶皆可生发。

But more than that: trying to develop the relationship between Shinji and Asuka so that the positive aspects can outweigh the positive aspects, in my view, is a way of trying to reconnect with my own mind and happiness.  
但更重要的是：试图发展真嗣和明日香之间的关系，使得积极的一面能够超越消极的一面，在我看来，是一种尝试与自己的心灵和幸福重新建立联系的方式。

Accept that in a complex and imperfect world, my flaws and insecurities will not prevent me from taking pleasure in living and connecting with people.  
接受在这个复杂且不完美的世界中，我的缺陷和不安全感不会妨碍我享受生活和与人建立联系。

That's why, despite what some troll comments over the internet says, Asushin is not toxic. Far from it. It's about hope.  
这就是为什么，尽管网上有些喷子的评论如此，Asushin（真嗣与明日香的配对）并非有毒。远非如此。它关乎希望。

In my case, a hope that neither my ego, pride and masks that I put on to maintain an image before society (Asuka) nor my depressive thoughts and desire to run away from problems and not connect with the world (Shinji) will overcome my unwavering will to live, win, love and be a reference for people (Asuka) and my courage and ability to have empathy and sacrifice myself for others (Shinji).  
就我而言，我希望无论是我为了在社会（明日香）面前维持形象而戴上的自我、骄傲和面具，还是我那些抑郁的念头和逃避问题、不愿与世界相连的欲望（真嗣），都不会压倒我坚定不移的生存意志、胜利渴望、爱的能力，以及成为他人榜样（明日香）的勇气，以及我对他人产生共鸣和牺牲自我的能力（真嗣）。

Because, as Rei and Kaworu said in End of Evangelion, they represent the hope that people will be able to understand each other and also learn to love themselves and love others.  
因为，正如《新世纪福音战士剧场版：终》中绫波零和渚薰所说，他们代表着人们能够相互理解，并学会自爱和爱他人的希望。

Is it a false hope? Well… maybe. That's what this fic tries to explore.  
这是否是一种虚假的希望？嗯……或许吧。这就是这篇同人作品试图探讨的。

**5) Comments on chapter 1 – Mustn't Run Away Train  
5) 第一章评论 – 不可逃避的列车**

This entire chapter is a parody of the opening scenes of the movie Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind, including some dialogue.  
本章全文是对电影《美丽心灵的永恒阳光》开场场景的戏仿，包括部分对话。

The appearance of Shinji and Asuka - who in this story are 16-18 years old - was based on their appearance in Evangelion: ANIMA, especially the fact that Shinji is wearing a ponytail. However, braided-hair Asuka was an homage to the people of Asushin Discord that are fans of those kind of arts (cuuuute!).  
碇真嗣和惣流·明日香·兰格雷在本故事中的形象（16 至 18 岁），是基于《福音战士新剧场版：终》中的设定，特别是真嗣扎着马尾辫这一点。而编发造型的明日香，则是对那些喜欢此类艺术风格的 Asushin Discord 粉丝们的致敬（超可爱！）。

The scene about the bet that Asuka made about "kissing on my mouth without touching my lips" was based on a real-life situation. Hint for the reader: if a person in whom you have romantic interest proposes this bet to you, the correct answer is to lose the bet ;).  
关于明日香提出的那个关于“不触碰嘴唇而亲吻我”的赌注场景，灵感来源于真实生活情境。给读者的提示：如果你心仪的人向你提出这个赌注，正确的回答是故意输掉 ;)。

**6) Comments on chapter 2 – Unfamiliar Ceiling  
6) 对第二章《陌生的天花板》的评论**

The opening of this chapter contains dialogues that Shinji heard during the instrumentality, shown in the movie The End of Evangelion. In that particular scene, the phrases represent remnants of lost memories and the feeling of failure.  
本章开头包含了一些对话，这些是真嗣在电影《新世纪福音战士剧场版：THE END OF EVANGELION》中经历人类补完计划时听到的。在那个特定场景中，这些话语代表了失落记忆的残片和失败感。

We also introduced our first OC: Zack-Rey (Haruka), based on this great artist/writer that also knows a lot about Evangelion and kindly shares lots of interesting information with us on Asushin Discord.  
我们还引入了我们的第一位原创角色：Zack-Rey（遥），灵感来源于这位伟大的艺术家/作家，他对《新世纪福音战士》非常了解，并在 Asushin Discord 上慷慨地与我们分享了许多有趣的信息。

As you may have already noticed, all of the OC's presented in this story were created as an homage to great artists who draws Asushin fanart.  
你可能已经注意到，这个故事中出现的所有原创角色都是为了向那些绘制 Asushin 同人画的伟大艺术家致敬。

The scene where Shinji tries to play the famous Bach Cello's Suite #1 only to fail miserably, because all of his memories of this music have been erased (because he associates this music with the memory of Asuka) was the first scene of this fanfic that I wrote.  
真嗣试图演奏著名的巴赫大提琴组曲第一号却惨败的场景，是因为他所有关于这段音乐的记忆都被抹去了（因为他将这段音乐与明日香的记忆联系在一起），这是我为这部同人小说写下的第一个场景。

Yadoraki was placed as "captain" of "team Shinji" for his relevance and importance as an Asushin art creator for almost a decade and the same criteria was adopted with Amelie Sabo, "captain" of "team Asuka". Kazumi Minagawa and Iennekko were put here on "team Shinji" because they are artists that have more traditional eastern names and it was difficult to add others because I had to give some space to Hyuga and Maia at this point in the story.  
矢鸟被任命为“真嗣队”的“队长”，这不仅因为他在近十年来作为 Asushin 艺术创作者的相关性和重要性，同样标准也适用于阿梅丽·萨博，即“明日香队”的“队长”。美奈川和伊内克被分配到“真嗣队”，因为他们是拥有传统东方名字的艺术家，而且此时故事中必须为日向和玛雅留出空间，因此难以再加入其他人。

The scene when Yadoraki told Shinji the words that Shinji himself had used when he decided to pilot the Eva again to protect Asuka was great, because pretty much everything that Shinji said was almost entirely made up of titles from fanfics by the author Angel13Bardiel.  
矢鸟告诉真嗣那些真嗣自己曾用以决定再次驾驶 Eva 保护明日香的话语的场景非常精彩，因为真嗣所说的几乎完全是由作者 Angel13Bardiel 的同人小说标题构成的。

Using Jet Alone in the story was an interesting solution to justify the plot and the fact that only Unit 02 is still a functional Eva (otherwise why not use the MPE's?). But the battle scene was immensely difficult to write. Personally, I liked only the ending of the battle, in which we had a kind of "remake" of the final scene from The End of Evangelion, but this time Shinji refused to squeeze his opponent's neck. Thank goodness.  
在故事中使用 Jet Alone 是一个有趣的解决方案，用以合理化剧情并说明只有 02 号机仍是功能正常的 Eva（否则为何不使用 MPE 呢？）。但战斗场景的撰写极为困难。个人而言，我只喜欢战斗的结尾部分，那是一种对《EVA 剧场版：Air/真心为你》最终场景的“重制”，但这次真嗣拒绝掐住对手的脖子。谢天谢地。

**7) Comments on chapter 3– Kimochi Warui  
7) 对第 3 章的评论——Kimochi Warui**

As in the previous chapter, many OC's were added to the story.  
与前一章一样，故事中加入了许多原创角色。

Many were referenced only to act along with Avil in the mission to deliver Gendo's plans to the contacts at Nerv Japan, controlled by Yadoraki, because there was no sensible way to further involve them into the plot.  
许多角色仅被提及，以便与 Avil 一起执行任务，将碇源堂的计划传递给由矢多里控制的 Nerv 日本分部的联系人，因为没有合理的方式进一步将他们卷入剧情中。

Amelie and Holly were charged with the responsibility of guiding Asuka as a pilot. Arin and CC, on the other hand - two of Asushin's most sensational and active performers in recent months - were tasked with helping Asuka as a human being.  
阿梅莉和霍莉肩负起指导明日香作为驾驶员的责任。而另一方面，亚林和 CC——近几个月来 Asushin 中最引人注目且活跃的两位表演者——则被赋予了帮助明日香作为普通人的任务。

The scene of Arin doing Baumkuchen for Asuka was one of the ones I enjoyed the most, because besides serving to show the discomfort with the loss of memories (Baumkuchen was the word Shinji used in episode 8 when Asuka asked him to think in German when they were inside Unit 02), the side effects of the contact procedure (loss of taste) and, in addition, a joke with the fact that Arin's twitter profile is a variation of this word.  
亚林为明日香制作巴姆库亨的场景是我最喜欢的之一，因为它不仅展示了因记忆丧失带来的不适（巴姆库亨是第 8 集中明日香让真嗣用德语思考时他在初号机内使用的词），还体现了接触程序的副作用（味觉丧失），并且巧妙地利用了亚林的推特简介与这个词的变体之间的玩笑。

Also, all of these OC's were more important to the plot because the chapter as a whole was shaped to show Asuka's drama.  
此外，这些原创角色对剧情的重要性在于，整个章节都是围绕展现明日香的内心冲突而构建的。

The idea of her undergoing an experiment similar to Kyoko's and losing part of her soul, besides moving the story forward, was a way to also bring Sohryu's drama a little closer to Shikinami's drama. So we have here an Asuka completely on the verge of collapse.  
她经历类似于绫波零的实验并失去部分灵魂的想法，不仅推动了故事发展，也是将惣流的故事与式波的故事拉近的一种方式。因此，我们在这里看到的是一个完全濒临崩溃的明日香。

And yet the memories of a certain idiot were still around somewhere, leading to what it is perhaps my favorite scene of the story: Asuka trying to find German swear words to refer to Shinji and not being able to use the perfect word for it until she had her "Eureka" moment, which in this case was the re-discovery of the classic word "Baka".  
然而，某个笨蛋的记忆仍然在某处徘徊，这导致了或许是我在整个故事中最喜欢的场景：明日香试图寻找德语的脏话来称呼真嗣，却直到她的“尤里卡”时刻才找到那个完美的词，即重新发现经典的“笨蛋”（Baka）。

And all in all, Asuka dominated the entire battle, almost losing by a flashback that happened at the wrong time but in the end she got an important victory.  
总的来说，明日香主导了整场战斗，几乎因为一个不合时宜的闪回而失败，但最终她取得了重要的胜利。

**8) Comments on chapter 4– If I Can't Be Yours  
8) 对第 4 章的评论——如果我不能成为你的**

In this chapter we again parody the scenes from the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but developing the plot by explaining that the procedure of separating part of the pilot's soul and put that part inside the Eva would result in the loss of precious memories. A very similar concept to Kyoko's experiment in the original story.  
在本章中，我们再次戏仿了电影《美丽心灵的永恒阳光》中的场景，但通过解释将驾驶员灵魂的一部分分离并放入 Eva 中会导致珍贵记忆的丧失，从而推进了剧情。这一概念与原作中绫波零的实验非常相似。

Asuka at the beginning of the flashback is still dealing with conflicting feelings towards Shinji and, unfortunately, takes the attitude of apparently agreeing with the arguments of internet trolls who say that they are toxic and will never be able to be happy together. But she made that decision only because she thinks it is the best thing to do for her and for Shinji as well.  
在闪回的开头，明日香仍在处理对真嗣的矛盾情感，不幸的是，她采取了表面上同意网络喷子观点的态度，认为他们是有毒的，永远无法幸福地在一起。但她做出这个决定只是因为她认为这对她和真嗣都是最好的选择。

In the sequel, Asuka reveals her jealousy, especially towards Rei and Kaworu, but we also get a hilarious little comedy scene in which Shinji describes that in some realities there was a girl for him whose name started with "Ma". Anyone who knows the history of the Evangelion expanded universe knows that at least three characters can fit this description. And I'm not talking about Mari ^^.  
在续集中，明日香透露了她的嫉妒，尤其是对绫波和渚，但我们还看到了一个搞笑的小喜剧场景，其中真嗣描述在某些现实中，有一个名字以“Ma”开头的女孩与他相伴。任何熟悉《新世纪福音战士》扩展宇宙历史的人都知道，至少有三个人物符合这一描述。而我说的可不是真希波哦^^。

After this scene, we have the "reunion" between Shinji and Asuka and one of the most important scenes of the story, in which Shinji reveals his experiences in the instrumentality and in all the universes he has experienced (including the various spin offs). In this reality, Shinji describes the dilemma: in universes where he and Asuka got together (as in Angelic Days) the Evangelions still exist and their future is uncertain, and in universes where he succeeds in ending the Evangelions, he and Asuka (in theory) stay apart. The idea of justifying Sohryu and Shikinami's existance by making RoE the "last universe" of instrumentality aimed to give an interesting explanation to show why Sohryu was not in the Rebuilds. Sohryu had begun her procedure to return to reality, especially from EoE's expanded live action sequence, in which she heard Shinji call out to her and began to suspect that that world was not real.  
这一幕之后，我们将迎来真嗣与明日香的重逢，这也是故事中最关键的场景之一。在这个场景中，真嗣揭示了他在融合过程中以及他所经历的所有宇宙（包括各种衍生作品）中的经历。在这个现实中，真嗣描述了他的困境：在那些他与明日香走到一起的宇宙（如《天使之诗》中），使徒依然存在，他们的未来充满不确定性；而在那些他成功终结使徒的宇宙中，他与明日香（理论上）分道扬镳。通过将《终》设定为融合的“最后一个宇宙”，旨在为为什么草薙素子不在《新剧场版》中提供一个有趣的解释。草薙素子已经开始她的回归现实程序，特别是在《真心为你》的扩展真人序列中，她听到了真嗣对她的呼唤，并开始怀疑那个世界并非真实。

After this scene, Shinji opens his heart to her and she starts to remember the good times they had together and how the sum of those moments really were able to make her fall in love with the boy.  
这一幕之后，真嗣向她敞开了心扉，她开始回忆起他们共同度过的美好时光，以及这些时刻如何真正让她爱上了这个男孩。

In the sequence, touching scenes with Asuka regretting not having acted differently before and a mirror image of Shikinami's final scene in the last RoE movie, to give even more emotional effect and a warm up for the next chapter.  
在这一幕中，有明日香后悔之前未采取不同行动的感人场景，以及与《终》电影中式波最后一幕的镜像画面，为情感效果增添更多层次，并为下一章节预热。

**9) Comments on chapter 5 – Everything You've Ever Dreamed  
9) 第五章评论 – 你所梦想的一切**

This one was the most complex chapter to write.  
这一章是写作起来最为复杂的。

It's a mirror story to the previous chapter, but adding even more drama and plot development were my "deeds to perform" in this one.  
这是上一章的镜像故事，但在这一章中，我增加了更多的戏剧性和情节发展，这些都是我需要完成的任务。

At the beginning, we have an extremely nervous and upset Shinji with the fact that Asuka has abandoned him and that, despite his efforts, the Evangelions have been recreated.  
故事一开始，我们看到一个极度紧张和不安的真嗣，因为明日香已经离开了他，而且尽管他努力了，但使徒们还是被重新创造了出来。

The old pre-instrumental Shinji would perhaps react passively. But I think this Shinji, under those circumstances, would react in a more aggressive way, unleashing the beast within, like the time he returned the punch on Toji and the times he battled fiercely against the Angels.  
以前的那个没有使用乐器的真嗣可能会被动应对。但我认为，在这种情境下的真嗣，会以更积极的方式回应，释放内心的野兽，就像他回击了冬二的那一拳，以及他在与使徒激烈战斗时的那些时刻。

But he is still Shinji, and so he showed all his anger without hurting anyone but himself.  
但他依旧是真嗣，所以他将所有的愤怒都发泄在自己身上，没有伤害到任何人。

Yadoraki again was important in the plot, explaining to Shinji and the reader what was going on and being honest with him, albeit belatedly. Jima and Yuko are two great artists with wonderful Asushin art but who have unfortunately "retired", so in the plot they were left to prepare Jet Alone instead of being directly involved with Shinji and Asuka. Kyo is an artist famous for drawing Shinji and Asuka in kindergarten. Extremely cute.  
矢多里鹿吉在剧情中再次扮演了重要角色，向真嗣和读者解释发生了什么，并尽管迟了些，但诚实地对待他。志摩和由子是两位伟大的艺术家，创作了许多美妙的明日香和真嗣的艺术作品，但遗憾的是他们已经“退休”，因此在剧情中他们被安排去准备 Jet Alone，而不是直接参与真嗣和明日香的故事。Kyo 是一位以绘制幼儿园时期的真嗣和明日香而闻名的艺术家，画风极其可爱。

After, we have the beach scene and the next scene, at the shelter, in which we see Shinji's frustration of not being able to connect with Asuka because he doesn't know how to act.  
之后，我们有了海滩场景和接下来的避难所场景，在这些场景中我们可以看到真嗣因为不知道如何与明日香相处而感到的挫败感。

The almost two weeks' time span when Shinji was alone was calculated based on the rust on Misato's cross that was nailed to her marker.  
碇真嗣独自度过的近两周时间，是根据钉在美里墓碑上的十字架上的锈迹推算出来的。

Also, the "ghost arm" scene was even considered as an alternate ending to End of Evangelion. Fortunately, it was discarded and we were blessed with one of the most iconic anime scenes of all time.  
此外，“幽灵手臂”场景甚至曾被考虑作为《新世纪福音战士剧场版：Air/真心为你》的替代结局。幸运的是，这一设想被舍弃了，我们得以欣赏到有史以来最具标志性的动画场景之一。

Shinji shooting a gun to wake up Asuka from a nightmare was maybe an overkill, but I thought it was an over the top, but justified course of action for them under the circumstances. It sparked an interesting conversation that leaded to their final moments together in the real world.  
碇真嗣用枪唤醒噩梦中的明日香，或许有些过激，但我认为在当时的情境下，这一夸张却合理的举动是必要的。它引发了一场有趣的对话，直接导致了他们在现实世界中的最终时刻。

After that, perhaps one of the most emotional scenes of the story. Asuka, mirroring Shinji's monologue from the last chapter, opens her heart to him. In her dialogue, she kinda gave Shinji everything that he – and some fans - needed to hear about her ("You don't even talk to me! It's impossible.") while also acknowledging the greatness of Rei and Kaworu as Evangelion characters and why they are so appealing as alternate pairings from Shinji. Also, the old and dumb "best girl" discussion was "solved" by Shinji: both Asuka and Rei are amazing.  
此后，或许是故事中最感人的一幕。明日香效仿上一章真嗣的独白，向他敞开了心扉。在她的对话中，她几乎给了真嗣（以及一些粉丝）关于她的一切需要听到的（“你甚至不跟我说话！这不可能。”），同时也承认了丽和薰作为《EVA》角色及其作为真嗣替代配对的吸引力。此外，那个老掉牙的“最佳女孩”争论被真嗣“解决”了：明日香和丽都很出色。

So, after that, Shinji got back into his "good and old" persona, and, sadly, suffered a lot as he realized that he had it all in his hands, but blew his chances.  
于是，在那之后，真嗣回到了他“善良而老派”的自我，不幸的是，他意识到自己本已握有一切，却错失了良机，为此受了不少苦。

And, to wrap it up, another heartbreaking scene, mirroring the ending scene of the last movie of RoE, with Asuka saying pretty much everything that some fans said about the "meaning" of that movie right after the first leaks of the movie in Japan: that we (and Shinji) should move on and give up on foolish dreams and childhood crushes. Touch grass and everything like that. So, forget about Asuka, Shinji. And forget about Asushin, audience. Or…. maybe not?  
最后，再来一个令人心碎的场景，呼应《终》电影的结尾，明日香几乎说出了一些粉丝在电影首次在日本泄露后对电影“意义”的看法：我们（和真嗣）应该向前看，放弃愚蠢的梦想和童年的迷恋。触碰现实，诸如此类。所以，忘记明日香吧，真嗣。也忘记 Asushin 吧，观众们。或者……也许并不？

**10) Comments on chapter 6 – All is Right With the World  
10) 第六章评论 – 世界一切安好**

My favorite chapter, even though it was perhaps a bit tiring to read because a lot of dialogue was needed to explain a bit more of the plot.  
我最喜欢的章节，尽管阅读起来可能有点累，因为需要大量对话来解释更多的情节。

I really enjoyed writing the opening scene, with Shinji and Asuka meeting again, seeing and touching each other, with their memories fully restored, for the first time since the beach scene at the end of The End of Evangelion.  
我非常喜欢写开篇场景，真嗣和明日香再次相遇，看到并触摸对方，记忆完全恢复，这是自《新世纪福音战士剧场版：终结的开始》结尾海滩场景以来的第一次。

But the resolution could not be that easy.  
但解决之道绝不会如此简单。

So, in the sequel, an external conflict was established: Shinji and Asuka should abandon their moment of happiness to face reality and choose between saving the world and the people who put them in that situation, but who also care and cared for them.  
因此，在续集中，设定了一个外部冲突：真嗣和明日香必须放弃他们的幸福时刻，面对现实，在拯救世界和那些将他们置于这种境地却又关心他们的人之间做出选择。

These people represent the fans of Evangelion: many of them want Shinji and Asuka to be unhappy or at least not together, but just as many (and maybe even more), want them to be happy and preferably together.  
这些人代表了 EVA 的粉丝：许多人希望真嗣和明日香不幸福，或者至少不在一起，但同样多（甚至可能更多）的人希望他们幸福，最好是能在一起。

Shinji, with the best of intentions, decided to resolve the impasse by sacrificing himself to give Asuka the chance to have a happy life in which she could fulfill all her dreams, even without his presence (similar to what he did in the Rebuilds).  
出于最美好的愿望，真嗣决定通过牺牲自己来解决僵局，让明日香有机会在没有他的情况下拥有一个幸福的生活，实现她所有的梦想（类似于他在《重建》系列中的做法）。

Only, unlike in the Rebuilds, here we are talking about Sohryu. And she would never accept that. Describing the scene of her imagining what a life in a world without Shinji and having other relationships would be like - including wondering if the guy on the date arranged by Hikari was really boring or if she was the one who didn't know how to enjoy the moment - is not exactly a new idea, but it was used here with the purpose of showing that she would not accept that answer and also to put a little doubt and excitement (fear) in the reader that that would be the outcome of the story.  
然而，与《重建》不同，这里我们谈论的是惣流。她绝不会接受这样的结局。描述她想象在一个没有真嗣的世界里，与其他人建立关系的生活场景——包括猜测如果光安排的约会对象真的很无聊，还是她自己不知道如何享受当下——并不是一个新奇的想法，但在这里使用这个场景是为了表明她不会接受这样的答案，同时也给读者带来一丝疑虑和紧张（恐惧），让他们担心这将是故事的结局。

After her return, a "fight" scene that was much better than the scenes where the two faced each other piloting unit 02 and Jet Alone. The imaginary sea scene changing, the storm falling, and the graphic depiction of Asuka's violent reaction was a sample of what can occur when the souls trapped within the Evangelion core begin to enter into disagreements and insoluble standoffs.  
在她归来后，一场“战斗”场景远胜于两人驾驶二号机与 Jet Alone 对峙的那些片段。想象中的海面变幻，风暴降临，以及对明日香激烈反应的生动描绘，展示了当被困在 EVA 核心中的灵魂开始产生分歧和无法化解的对峙时可能发生的情况。

After the storm, of course, the calm. And after more moments of connection between them, Shinji begins to detail the answer.  
风暴过后，自然是一片宁静。而在更多的心灵相通时刻之后，真嗣开始详细阐述他的答案。

Shinji's theory and the interactions between them at this point aim to seek a new solution to their dilemma. In face of this scenario, they decided to seek their path together, for themselves and for the people who believed in them.  
真嗣的理论及他们此刻的互动旨在寻求解决他们困境的新方案。面对这一情景，他们决定共同寻找自己的道路，既为了自己，也为了那些相信他们的人。

Even if Evangelion "is reduced to discussions about Asushin" and the rest of the world turns up its nose, that's fine.  
即使《新世纪福音战士》"沦为仅讨论明日香和真嗣"，而世界其他角落对此嗤之以鼻，那也无妨。

In other words, if what will be left of "Evangelion" are just the stories about Shinji and Asuka, that's good enough.  
换句话说，如果《新世纪福音战士》最终只剩下关于真嗣和明日香的故事，那也足够了。

And, that decision having been made, Asuka and Shinji are finally able to reconnect in a full way. As battle buddies, friends, and most importantly, people who recognize each other's faults and virtues, and yet are able to forgive and love each other.  
而这一决定既定，明日香和真嗣终于能够全面地重新连接。作为战友、朋友，最重要的是，作为那些既能看到彼此的缺点和优点，又能相互原谅和深爱的人。

One of the first things I planned for this story was the ending.  
这部故事我最早构思的元素之一就是结局。

I know that many readers may find the ending strange and perhaps even escapist and contradictory to the premise of "mustn't run away", but the idea here was to show - in an ending "a la" Evangelion that even in circumstances that are sad and without any hope, there is always a way out, even if it is very difficult and laborious.  
我知道许多读者可能会觉得这个结局奇怪，甚至有些逃避现实，与‘不能逃跑’的前提相矛盾，但这里的意图是展示——以一种类似《新世纪福音战士》式的结局——即使在悲伤且毫无希望的情况下，总有一条出路，哪怕这条路异常艰难和费力。

But it is possible to find that way out and happiness, despite the circumstances. And the answer, metaphorized by Asuka and Shinji, consists in resolving the eternal struggle of the human condition and the hedgehog's dilemma not like in a fight to the death in which strangulations and caresses will continually alternate (pain and pleasure) in a Schopenhauerian dilemma, but like in a dance, synchronized, in which two people (and humanity as a whole) will continually try to get in sync: when one person misses the timing, the other will be there to correct and adapt.  
尽管环境如此，找到那条出路和幸福是有可能的。而答案，通过明日香和真嗣的隐喻，在于解决人类境遇和刺猬困境的永恒斗争，不是像一场生死搏斗，其中扼杀与抚摸将不断交替（痛苦与快乐），陷入叔本华式的困境，而是像一支舞蹈，同步进行，两个人（以及整个人类）将不断尝试同步：当一个人错过时机，另一个人就会在那里纠正和适应。

And vice versa. 反之亦然。

Instead of the eternal tension between pain and pleasure, a constant, collaborative effort to evolve and move forward not alone, but together with others.  
不再是无尽的痛苦与快乐之间的紧张对抗，而是一种持续的、协作的努力，共同进化并向前迈进，不是孤身一人，而是与他人携手。

This answer to the hedgehog's dilemma is not even new.  
这个对刺猬困境的解答甚至算不上新颖。

It was already there, in the first episode of Evangelion I watched when I was 13: Episode 9, Both of You, Dance Like you Want to win.  
早在 13 岁那年，我第一次观看《新世纪福音战士》时，那份感觉便已悄然萌生：那是第九集，《你们俩，尽情舞动，只为胜利》。

And if Shinji and Asuka were able to connect which each other and win, then maybe that is a good answer.  
若真嗣与明日香能彼此相连并赢得胜利，或许那便是美好的答案。

However, that ambiguity and perhaps misunderstanding of the final scene motivated me to create the epilogue to work that idea out better.  
然而，正是那最后一幕的模糊与可能的误解，激发了我创作续篇的灵感，以更深入地探索这一想法。

11) Comments on the epilogue – We Will Never Forget.  
11) 对后记的评论 —— 我们永志不忘。

The whole monologue and scene with Gendo talking to Yui about the future of Evangelion and about Shinji and Asuka represents the author (me) talking to a metaphorical "Hideaki Anno" about the future of Evangelion and about Shinji and Asuka.  
整个独白和场景中，源堂与唯讨论《EVA》及真嗣与明日香的未来，象征着作者（我）与一个隐喻性的“庵野秀明”探讨《EVA》及真嗣与明日香的未来。

Although Yui's "mission" with Evangelion has ended the way she wanted it to, Gendo, despite loving her, will never stop trying to find some other answer and think differently about Evangelion. The same goes for Anno and for me (and, I guess, for a lot of fans).  
尽管唯在《EVA》中的“使命”如她所愿地结束了，但深爱她的源堂，尽管爱她，却永远不会停止寻找其他答案，对《EVA》有不同的思考。同样的情况也适用于庵野和我（以及，我想，很多粉丝）。

About the final scene, the old man and the old lady show us that one day in our lives, when we least realize it, we will forget all the time we were (willingly or unwillingly) "trapped" or "stuck" in Evangelion.  
关于最后一幕，老先生与老太太向我们展示，在我们生命中的某一天，当我们最不经意时，我们会忘记所有在 EVA 中（无论是自愿还是被迫）‘被困’或‘停滞’的时光。

But it doesn't matter at all.  
但这根本无关紧要。

Because if there is something that will always remain within our minds and hearts and will never be forgotten… that would be the emotions that Evangelion - not only Anno's original work, but all the spin offs, songs and fan works - gave us and, especially in my case, the memories and lessons of Shinji and Asuka's complicated relationship and beautiful romance story that represents humanity's eternal search for the solution of the hedgehog's dilemma.  
因为如果有什么东西会永远留在我们的脑海和心中，永远不会被遗忘……那就是 EVA——不仅仅是庵野秀明的原作，还包括所有衍生作品、歌曲和粉丝作品——给予我们的情感，尤其是对我来说，关于真嗣和明日香复杂关系以及代表人类永恒寻求刺猬困境解决方案的美丽爱情故事的记忆和教训。
