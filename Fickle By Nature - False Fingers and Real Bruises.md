Asuka growled and struck downward, her insides yielding with distant pain as she impaled herself, but it was worth the distant pain as she knew her victory was close at hand. Her opponent gasped under her, the remaining air forced of their lungs as it writhed and bucked. She took advantage of the opening and pounced again, slamming all of her weight down onto him.  
明日香咆哮着向下猛击，内心深处隐隐作痛，但她知道自己胜利在即，这点痛楚便显得微不足道。她的对手在她身下喘息，剩余的空气被挤出肺部，身体扭曲挣扎。她趁机再次扑上，将全身重量狠狠压在他身上。

He sputtered, choking, and she grinned madly in the darkness. She was even closer now, close enough that she could imagine her climax drawing back like a wave on the precipice of gushing forth to sweep her away.  
他呛咳着，喘不过气来，而她在黑暗中疯狂地咧嘴笑。现在她更近了，近到仿佛能感受到高潮如退潮般蓄势待发，即将将她卷走。

Then her enemy whimpered for the what had to be the umpteenth time and suddenly the wave receded further…and further…until finally it was out sight, leaving her stranded with a fire that continued to burn in the pit of her stomach.  
随后，她的敌人再次呜咽起来，这必定是第无数次了，突然间，那股浪潮退得更远……更远……直到最终消失在视线之外，留下她在原地，腹中的火焰依旧熊熊燃烧。

She hissed in rage as she she pounced again, impaling herself hard enough to make the bed frame and it's other occupant creak in protest.  
她愤怒地嘶吼着再次扑上去，用力之猛以至于床架和另一边的同伴都发出了抗议的吱嘎声。

But her desperate attack was useless, the pleasure gone, and the stoked flame remain unquenched as it's slowly fading heat dissipated.  
但她的绝望攻击毫无用处，快感已逝，那被挑起的火焰依旧未被平息，随着逐渐消散的热度慢慢淡去。

Chest heaving, she pushed down the urge to scream until her throat was as sore as her cunt, knowing it would only attract her few neighbors and any passing patrols.  
胸膛起伏，她强压下尖叫的冲动，直到喉咙痛如私处，深知此举只会引来寥寥无几的邻居和任何路过的巡逻队。

Finally, she bitterly admitted defeat and leaned forward, taking a moment to quickly wipe away the sweat trailing down her cheek before they could land on him.  
最终，她苦涩地承认失败，向前倾身，迅速擦去顺着脸颊流下的汗水，以免滴落在他身上。

With that done, she dismounted from his lap with a vulgar sucking sound that cemented her foul mood, before pushing him aside to take his place laying down. He rolled with the motion, probably expecting it, and sat on the edge of the mattress with a grunt.  
事已至此，她从他腿上下来，发出一声粗俗的吮吸声，更加剧了她的恶劣心情，随后将他推到一旁，自己躺了下来。他随着动作翻滚，大概早有预料，坐在床沿，闷哼一声。

For a while neither of them said a word, simply letting the steam from their bodies permeate into the already humid darkness.  
有好一会儿，两人都没说话，只是任由身体散发的热气融入这本就潮湿的黑暗中。

Then, after two or so minutes by her estimate, the thick silence was interrupted by the snap of rubber and a wet _pop_. The figure stirred and she heard something land in the trash next to her bed.  
然后，大约两分钟后，她估计，那厚重的沉默被橡胶的断裂声和一声湿润的啪嗒声打破。那身影动了动，她听到有什么东西落在了她床边的垃圾桶里。

She grimaced, hurriedly pulling on the long sleeved shirt that she had prepared before the start of their coitus.  
她皱了皱眉，急忙穿上事先准备好的长袖衬衫，那是他们在开始交欢前她就已经准备好的。

With her body covered, she reached her hand out, briefly fumbled with a chain, and by act of woman, not god, or a cabal of geezers seeking to become god, there was light.  
她全身裹得严实，伸手摸索着链条，不是神明，也不是一群渴望成神的老家伙们，而是凭借女性的力量，点亮了光明。

He hissed, turning away from her and shielding his face with his arm.  
他嘶嘶作声，转身背对她，用胳膊遮住脸庞。

She sneered at how he withdrew from the light, trying to avoid being exposed to her, as he always did whenever their sessions were over.  
她对他躲避光线的样子嗤之以鼻，每次会面结束时，他总是这样试图避免被她揭露。

Asuka was well aware the real source of her building frustration was her ruined orgasm, at her _failure_ to achieve something so simple even a dog could do it.  
明日香很清楚，她日益增长的挫败感的真正来源是她那被毁掉的性高潮，以及她未能达成如此简单的事情，甚至连狗都能做到。

However, the frustration was lessened by the fact that she couldn't be the only one blame. After all, why did she even allow him into her home if he couldn't at least do the most basic thing a man was capable of?  
然而，这种挫败感因一个事实而有所减轻：她并非唯一该受责备的人。毕竟，如果他连一个男人最基本的能力都做不到，她为何还要让他进入她的家呢？

She opened her mouth to start venting but stopped as he raised his other "arm" and rotated it smoothly in it's socket at an unnatural angle.  
她张开嘴正要开始发泄，却在他举起另一只“手臂”并在关节处以不自然的角度顺畅旋转时停了下来。

At a glance, the prosthetic could've passed as a real limb, and she supposed that wasn't too surprising considering it's inner workings were based off the technology them to mentally sync with their war machines.  
乍一看，这假肢几乎可以以假乱真，考虑到其内部结构基于让他们能与战争机器心灵同步的技术，这倒也不足为奇。

She had been there when the surgeons and engineers had proclaimed how they had not stepped, but _leaped_ towards achieving the holy grail of bodily implants, finally allowing amputees to feel some semblance of sensation through the flesh-like material that hid a framework of cold thermoplastics and titanium. However, she had been far from impressed since the designers hadn't bothered to add the details and imperfections that made it seem like a real arm, like hair or veins, or the characteristic creases in the palm or on the knuckles.  
当外科医生和工程师宣布他们不仅迈步，更是跃进到了身体植入技术的圣杯——终于让截肢者通过类似肉体的材料感受到些许感觉，这种材料下隐藏着冰冷的热塑塑料和钛合金框架时，她就在场。然而，她对此并不感冒，因为设计师们连让假肢看起来像真手臂的细节和瑕疵都懒得添加，比如毛发、血管，或是手掌或指关节上的独特褶皱。

The result was an unnaturally smooth facsimile that seemed a better fit for a mannequin sitting in a store front, rather than on one of the world's only two pilots.  
结果是一个异常光滑的仿制品，更适合放在商店橱窗里的模特身上，而不是世界上仅有的两位驾驶员之一。

She fondly recalled how it's predecessor had desperately snapped outward, a purple plated arm imitating the motion an instant later to cast an AT-field over the ruins of her Unit-02…only for both shield and arms to be gored straight through.  
她深情地回忆起它的前任是如何拼命向外弹出，一只紫色装甲的手臂紧随其后模仿着动作，在她的二号机残骸上投下 AT 力场……结果盾牌和手臂都被直接贯穿。

A nauseating feeling of guilt suddenly threatened to fill her stomach, battling against the unraveling anger already there.  
一阵令人作呕的罪恶感突然袭来，试图填满她的胃，与那里已经逐渐消散的愤怒展开较量。

Asuka gritted her teeth and forced herself to remember how easily this new "arm" had tossed aside an oak table heavier than the both of them combined, before wrapping it's inhuman fingers around her neck. As her vision had degraded like an old shirt warmed by mouths, she remembered how the face behind the tool had become equally inhumane, projecting a fury that had outmatched even hers.  
明日香咬紧牙关，强迫自己记起这新“手臂”是如何轻易地甩开一张比他们俩加起来还重的橡木桌，然后用它那非人的手指掐住她的脖子。当她的视线像被旧衣服捂热的嘴巴一样模糊时，她记得那张藏在工具后面的脸也变得同样非人，散发出一种甚至超过她自己的狂怒。

She shuddered, tucking the memory into her arsenal, then moved on to scrutinize the the rest of her "lover".  
她颤抖了一下，将这段记忆收入自己的武器库，随后继续审视她的“爱人”。

He was stretching now, joints crackling and popping like wood in a campfire. His body had remained lean and wiry over the years, despite the constant beer runs they had indulged in up until recently, but his sinewy frame was filled out with muscles earned from routine exercise, underlining the new sense of grace he moved with. Even his features had changed for the better, the feminine angles of his face having a squared up just enough to give him the sturdy look that befitted a real man.  
他现在正在伸展身体，关节像篝火中的木头一样噼啪作响。尽管多年来他们一直沉溺于频繁的啤酒狂欢，直到最近才有所收敛，但他的身形依旧保持着瘦削和精悍。他的肌肉线条因日常锻炼而更加饱满，凸显出他新获得的优雅动作。甚至连他的面容也变得更加刚毅，原本女性化的脸部线条变得方正有力，更符合一个真正男子汉的坚实形象。

Say what you will about Shinji Ikari, but having the world nearly end had forced him to finally grow a spine, and, almost as if to spite her recurring doubts, he had continued to bear the weight of living rather than crumple beneath it.  
不管你怎么评价碇真嗣，但世界几乎毁灭的经历迫使他终于长出了脊梁骨，而且，仿佛是为了反驳她反复出现的疑虑，他继续承受着生活的重压，而不是在压力下崩溃。

Unfortunately, the same couldn't be said for the rest of the world.  
遗憾的是，世界其他地方的情况却并非如此。

She rolled to the right and narrowed her remaining eye at the trash can. The soft light of her lamp illuminated something grossly slick and glossy.  
她向右滚去，用剩下的那只眼睛紧盯着垃圾桶。台灯柔和的光线照亮了某种黏滑而光亮的东西。

"You didn't cum." “你没有射。”

He flinched at the edge of her vision, but didn't turn.  
他在她视野的边缘畏缩了一下，但没有转身。

"What?" "什么？"

She extended her arm and pinched the sleeve of rubber between two fingers and thrust it towards him with disgust. He was finally looking at her now, fabricated fingers running through brown hair that crowned a haggard looking face.  
她伸出手臂，用两根手指夹住那袖口的橡胶，厌恶地向他推去。他终于看向了她，仿造的手指穿过头顶的棕发，露出一张憔悴的面容。

Part of her felt…discomforted by the sheer misery she read in the dark rings beneath his bleary eyes, but the rest was filled disgust at the naked display of weakness.  
她的一部分感到……被他眼底深陷的黑圈中流露出的极度痛苦所困扰，但其余部分则充满了对这种赤裸裸软弱表现的厌恶。

Where was the beast that dared to hurt her? Where was the demon that wore her rival's face?  
那敢于伤害她的野兽在何处？那戴着她对手面孔的恶魔又在何方？

_It__'s obviously still hiding, like a wolf in sheep's clothing._ She thought to herself with a snarl, _I just have to draw it out._ _Then I can have revenge._  
显然它还在躲藏，如同披着羊皮的狼。她暗自咆哮，我只需将其引出，便可复仇。

She sucked in a breath and barked out the accusation in Japanese, as she always did when she made damn sure he couldn't weasel his way out by feigning ignorance of German.  
她深吸一口气，用日语厉声指控，正如她一贯所为，确保他无法通过假装不懂德语来逃避责任。

"_You. Didn__'t. Cum."_ "你。没。射。"

She smirked as his conditioning held true and he cringed at the switch in languages. He had been acting oddly for the past couple weeks, and this was a comforting return-to-form.  
她得意地笑了，他的条件反射果然如常，听到语言转换时他畏缩了一下。过去几周他一直行为古怪，现在这倒是让人安心的回归常态。

"A-Asuka I-" "A-Asuka 我-"

He was reverting back to stammering, but still had the audacity to keep looking confused as she tossed the used condom at him. He cringed again as it stuck to his chest like a vulgar parody of a boy scout badge.  
他再次结巴起来，但仍厚颜无耻地装出一副困惑的样子，任由她将用过的避孕套扔向他。当那东西黏在他胸前，像是对童子军徽章的粗俗模仿时，他再次畏缩了。

"I know haven't the the last two times? Is it because of this?" she raked her fingers under her remaining eye, actions replacing words she refused to indulge or tolerate.  
“我知道前两次不是这样，是因为这个吗？”她用手指在下眼睑处划过，以动作代替那些她不愿沉溺或容忍的话语。

His mouth began to move, but as always her tongue was quicker, sharper.  
他的嘴开始动起来，但一如既往，她的舌头更快，更锋利。

"Or am I not good enough for the _Invincible Shinji_? Or maybe I'm not tight enough?" she waved her hands at her covered groin, hating how bruised and hollow it felt and loathing how it would remain that way into the morning, "I bet you'd get off if you were fucking that green eyed haired _schlampe_ who just arrived at Wille HQ, wouldn't you? Mari? Mana? Whatever her name was. I bet you'd _love_ to see how wet she'd get you! Admit it!"  
"还是说，我配不上无敌的真嗣？又或者是我不够紧致？" 她挥手示意自己被遮盖的下体，厌恶那里的淤青和空虚感，更憎恨这种状态会持续到早晨，"我敢打赌，如果你在和那个刚到 Wille 总部的绿眼黑发婊子做爱，你一定会爽翻天，对吧？玛丽？玛娜？管她叫什么名字。我敢说你会喜欢看她让你有多湿！承认吧！"

She leaned forward, part of her recognizing that he had stopped moving away from her, but the rest drank deeply of the new heat pulsing through her veins.  
她向前倾身，一部分的她意识到他已经停止了远离她，但其余的部分则深深沉溺于新涌动的血液中的炽热。

"Or maybe you'd prefer Wonder Girl? What better cock sleeve to bend over and shove your dick in then a doll, and a _dead_ _one_ at that! You sick pervert!"  
"或者你更喜欢奇迹少女？还有什么比一个玩偶，还是一个死玩偶，更适合弯腰让你插入的肉套呢！你这个变态！"

"Asuka." “明日香。”

Her voice rose as he _dared_ say her name again, surging forward to crash against his orchestrated remorse.  
他竟敢再次提及她的名字，她的声音随之高涨，如潮水般涌向前，撞击着他精心编排的悔恨。

"Fake sex. Fake arm. Fake guilt. Everything about you is fake, _Rokubungi._"  
“假性爱，假手臂，假愧疚。六车，你的一切都是假的。”

Oh how he _recoiled_ at the use his true last name. But still he held his ground and even had the gall to shuffle toward her, face twisting with some new emotion.  
哦，他听到自己的真姓氏被如此使用时，不禁退缩。然而他依旧坚守阵地，甚至有胆量向她挪步，脸上带着某种新的情绪扭曲。

Suddenly a wave of cold fear splashed against inferno in her chest as she watched the bogus arm reach towards her, fingers spreading and ready snap back back together.  
突然间，一股冰冷的恐惧如潮水般涌入她胸中的烈焰，当她看着那只假臂向她伸来，手指张开，准备迅速合拢时。

"Asuka, I-" “明日香，我——”

She turned away, throwing herself back onto on the bed, away from the looming weapon and those treacherous blue eyes of his. Her own fingers dug into her ribs until she could pain blossom beneath desensitized flesh, and she reveled at the sense of control it gave her.  
她转身避开，将自己摔回床上，远离那逼近的武器和他那双背叛的蓝眼睛。她的手指紧紧扣入肋骨，直到麻木的肌肤下痛感绽放，她沉醉于这种控制感带来的快意。

"I can't believe I let you use me like this! I'm filthy now, disgusting, repugnant, worthless!"  
"我真不敢相信我竟让你这样利用我！我现在脏透了，恶心，令人厌恶，一文不值！"

She was screaming but her voice seemed distant as her nails bore deeper.  
她在尖叫，但声音听起来却很遥远，她的指甲越陷越深。

"I hate you, Third Child! I hate you! I feel sic-"  
"我恨你，三少爷！我恨你！我感觉恶心——"

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

The bed sagged and suddenly she felt those bloodless claws seize her shoulder through the her shirt. Taken by surprise, she felt another wave of fear as she imagined those claws squeezing down with monstrous strength until her flesh was pulped and bones shattered, leaving her even more broken, forcing her to replace even more her flesh with more vile plastics, making her into even more of a dol-  
床铺下陷，她突然感觉到那双无血色的爪子透过衬衫抓住了她的肩膀。猝不及防之下，她又感到一阵恐惧，想象着那些爪子以怪物般的力量挤压下来，直到她的血肉被碾碎，骨头断裂，让她更加支离破碎，迫使她用更恶心的塑料替换更多的肉体，使她变得更加像一个——

But her muscles weren't pulped, and her bones didn't shatter. Instead, the claws gripped gently, but firmly, and in her shock she couldn't resist being turned onto her back and forced to take in his sorry visage.  
但她的肌肉并未被碾碎，骨头也没有断裂。相反，那爪子温柔而坚定地握住她，在她震惊中，她无法抗拒地被翻过身来，被迫直视他那可怜的面容。

His expression and his entire posture radiated a distinct mixture of flagrant guilt and misery—the melancholic aura that had always seemed innate to his very being. Her mind screeched in betryal as her heart was filled with a sickening sense of nostalgia.  
他的表情和整个姿态都散发着一种明显的混合着公然的内疚和痛苦——那种忧郁的气息似乎一直与他如影随形。她的内心充满了令人作呕的怀旧感，而她的思绪却在背叛中尖叫。

"Asuka, I…" he said, blinking rapidly before focusing his eyes on her, "I just want to see your face."  
“明日香，我……”他快速眨眼，然后将目光聚焦在她身上，“我只是想看看你的脸。”

For what seemed like an eternity, the lingering remnants of shock remained. Then the all-too-familiar feeling of fury—her oldest companion, her _true_ partner—roared forth to replace it.  
仿佛过了永恒，震惊的余波依旧萦绕。随后，那再熟悉不过的愤怒感——她最老的朋友，真正的伙伴——咆哮着取而代之。

She grabbed the cruel device and pushed and pulled, but her efforts were in vain as it didn't budge and she only accomplished shaking herself.  
她抓住那残忍的装置，推拉之间，却徒劳无功，它纹丝不动，她只摇晃了自己。

With her fire stoked to new heights by her failure, her hand let go and spasmed, eager to claw at his face, to scratch out his heartbreakingly azure eyes.  
失败激起了她内心的怒火，她的手松开并痉挛着，急切地想要抓向他的脸，划破他那令人心碎的湛蓝眼眸。

_Stop! Remember! Remember the promise!  
停下！记住！记住那个承诺！_

The voice, her own voice, cut through her mind and her hooked fingers trembled as she ground her teeth and tried to block it out.  
那声音，她自己的声音，穿透她的思绪，她钩住的手指颤抖着，她咬紧牙关试图将其屏蔽。

Leave it to her battered heart to be held back by a vow made when she had been at her lowest.  
她的心早已伤痕累累，却因在她最低谷时立下的誓言而受阻。

Regardless of those hollow words, neither of one of them was a stranger to physical agony, so ripping into him would be useless. Besides, words had always been her most effective weapons against him.  
尽管那些空洞的话语无济于事，但他们两人对肉体痛苦都不陌生，所以对他施加痛苦毫无意义。况且，言语一直是她对付他最有效的武器。

She sucked in a breath and sat up sharply, nearly head-butting him.  
她猛地吸了一口气，坐起身来，差点一头撞上他。

"You want to see my face, huh? Why? So you can cum on it? You want to dirty me more? Is that what-"  
“你想看我的脸，是吗？为什么？这样你就可以射在上面？你想让我更脏吗？这就是——”

"I want to see your face when we do _this-_" Shinji cut in, his eyes narrowed into slits, and suddenly there was a warm hand on her thigh, encroaching on the thin strip of smooth skin where her scars ended and her womanhood began, "_Sex_. No more fucking in the dark. No more hiding."  
“我想在做这件事的时候看到你的脸——”真嗣打断道，他的眼睛眯成了一条缝，突然一只温暖的手放在她的大腿上，侵入了她伤疤结束、女性特质开始的光滑肌肤地带，“做爱。不再在黑暗中操。不再躲藏。”

The tension around his eyes lapsed, returning them to watery pools of regret.  
他眼周的紧张感消散了，恢复成充满悔意的泪汪汪的双眸。

She tried to look away, resisting to urge to feel sympathy, to feel anything but hatred, but his next words pinned her down as much as his hands.  
她试图移开视线，抗拒着同情心的涌动，只愿感受恨意，但他的下一句话却如他的双手般将她牢牢钉住。

"I want to see all of you, not just what you decide to show me," he said softly, "No more running away, Asuka."  
“我想看到你的全部，不仅仅是那些你决定展示给我的部分，”他轻声说道，“别再逃避了，明日香。”

She stilled, then slowly a growl rose in her throat, escalating into bellow as the words sank in, and this time she did a raise a hand to scratch at his face.  
她静止了片刻，随即喉咙中缓缓升起一声低吼，随着话语深入，吼声愈发响亮，这一次她真的举起手来抓向他的脸。

He didn't move, yet her claws swiped at empty air.  
他纹丝不动，而她的爪子却在空中划过。

She let out another howl of frustration, and he closed his eyes as she all but spit in his face.  
她再次发出一声愤怒的嚎叫，他闭上眼睛，她几乎是在他脸上吐口水。

"You bastard! Are _you_ accusing _me_ running away? _You of all people!_"  
"你这个混蛋！你是在指责我逃跑吗？偏偏是你！"

He swallowed thickly, weathering the blow. She worked her jaw and licked her lips, anticipating an excuse, or some backhanded retort, or worst of all, an apology.  
他艰难地咽了口唾沫，承受着打击。她咬紧牙关，舔了舔嘴唇，期待着一个借口，或是某种拐弯抹角的反驳，甚至最糟糕的，一个道歉。

But instead, her mouth dropped open, eye widening as he gripped his right shoulder with his left hand, his real hand, and with a grimace and a grunt he squeezed and _twisted_ where false flesh met real meat_._  
但出乎意料的是，她张大了嘴巴，眼睛瞪得溜圆，只见他用左手紧紧抓住右肩，那是他的真手，随着一阵痛苦的表情和闷哼，他在假肉与真肉的交界处用力挤压并扭动。

There was a wet hiss and the fake arm jerked, then _detached_, pulling away to reveal a knob like piece of metal covered in intricate circuitry, sticking out parallel to where the head of a humerus should've been.  
伴随着一声湿润的嘶嘶声，那只假臂猛地一抽，随即脱落，露出一块形似旋钮的金属部件，上面布满了精密的电路，直挺挺地伸出来，与肱骨头部应有的位置平行。

For a moment there was only silence as he eyed the dismembered limb a queasy look. Then he tossed it behind him, and she heard it land on the carpet with a muffled _thump._  
有那么一会儿，四周只有寂静，他带着一丝不适打量着那截断肢。随后，他将其向后一抛，她听到它落在地毯上，发出沉闷的扑通声。

She continued to stare as he looked up, the misery that radiated from his eyes replaced by emotions she couldn't quite discern, emotions that seemed unwavering, but still somehow fragile.  
她继续凝视着他，只见他抬起头，眼中流露出的痛苦已被一种难以捉摸的情感所取代，那种情感看似坚定，却又隐隐透着脆弱。

_Regret. Resolve. Longing.  
悔恨。决心。渴望。_

"I am," he answered, "I know I've been a coward, and a hypocrite, but we can't going on like this."  
“我是，”他回答，“我知道我一直是懦夫，是伪君子，但我们不能再这样下去了。”

He had known the moment she had opened her door, and transfixed him with that baleful but yearning gaze, that he would be forced to go forward with his plan.  
他一见到她开门，用那既严厉又充满渴望的目光将他定住的那一刻，他就知道不得不继续推进他的计划了。

And yet he had allowed himself to be pulled past the threshold, manhandled onto her bed, and subsequently conquered.  
然而，他还是任由自己被拉过门槛，被粗鲁地推到她的床上，随后被彻底征服。

When it came to sex with his fellow pilot, he had quickly discovered it was less a matter of "making love" and more a matter of surviving a relentless siege under the cover of unending night.  
与他的同僚飞行员发生关系时，他很快发现这与其说是“做爱”，不如说是夜幕掩护下一场无休止的顽强围攻。

Their couplings were _always_ preempted by a cover of contrived darkness; lights were turned off, doors were closed, curtains were drawn—she had even enforced that their phones be stowed out of reach, screens down. It had converted each room they met in into chambers of stifling gloom that reminded him of being back in Misato's closet, willing his cassette player to drown his out guardian's weeping.  
他们的每一次结合都先被刻意营造的黑暗所掩盖；灯被熄灭，门被关闭，窗帘被拉上——她甚至要求他们的手机都要收好，屏幕朝下。这使得他们每次相会的房间都变成了令人窒息的昏暗密室，让他回想起躲在美里小姐的衣柜里，希望自己的随身听能盖过监护人的哭泣声。

He would wait for her in the darkness while she undressed, until her outline would suddenly appear before him as if she were a phantom, and shortly after quick pecks gouged at his face and shoulders. Those brief grazes were rough and tense things, like the hands that held onto his so they wouldn't dare stray. Then she would release her hold, push him onto his back and begin her offensive in earnest.  
他会在黑暗中等待她宽衣解带，直到她的轮廓突然出现在他面前，仿佛她是一个幽灵，随后迅速的亲吻在他的脸颊和肩膀上留下痕迹。这些短暂的触碰粗暴而紧张，就像紧握着他的手，生怕有所偏离。然后她会松开手，将他推倒仰卧，开始认真地进攻。

Typically, she faced away from him, squatting on his cock and gripping his knees for balance like a warm blooded gargoyle overlooking a plaza of cotton sheets bordered by his long legs. Or, when she was too inebriated to coordinate, she would ride facing forward, allowing him to hold her hips as she attempted to grind his glands into raw meat.  
通常，她背对着他，蹲在他的阴茎上，抓住他的膝盖保持平衡，像一只温暖的血肉石像鬼俯瞰着由他长腿围成的棉质床单广场。或者，当她醉得无法协调时，她会正面骑乘，让他扶着她的臀部，试图将他的龟头磨成生肉。

Anything other this binary set of positions was dangerously close to having her beneath him—a suggestion that had nearly had driven her to outright leave when they had first stumbled into his bedroom on that fateful Spring night. He hadn't been sure whether to feel offended, embarrassed or fond over her refusal to "submit" to him, so he had gradually settled on experiencing all three as their trysts had continued.  
除了这两种位置之外的任何姿势都危险地接近于让她在他之下——这个建议在那个命运的春夜他们第一次跌跌撞撞进入他的卧室时几乎让她直接离开。他不确定是该感到被冒犯、尴尬还是对她拒绝“屈服”于他的喜爱，所以随着他们幽会的继续，他逐渐接受了这三种感觉。

For the first few times he had played his role, dutifully grunting and whimpering as she callously rode him as if he were an old warhorse sent out on a suicide run. He had even grown to enjoy it, suppressing the uneasy mix of emotions whirling within while he lost himself to the sheer savagery of her sustained blitz.  
起初几次他扮演着自己的角色，尽职地哼哼唧唧，任由她无情地驾驭，仿佛他是一匹上了年纪的战马，被派去执行自杀式任务。他甚至开始享受这种感觉，压抑着内心混杂的不安情绪，沉溺于她持续猛攻的纯粹野性之中。

Then, on the eighth time, there had been an unexpected break in the onslaught as she had leaned forward to adjust herself, her sweat laced mane nearly suffocating him.  
然而，到了第八次，猛烈的攻势突然出现了意外的停顿，她俯身调整姿势，汗水浸透的鬃毛几乎让他窒息。

It was then that he had heard _The Sound._  
就在那时，他听到了那个声音。

Prior to then, he had dismissed it as just series of passionate cries offered up to the muggy abyss. But at 3 A.M in morning, with no traffic outside his apartment and most of Berlin asleep, _The Sound_ had been unmistakable in the enclosed space.  
在那之前，他只当那是向闷热深渊发出的一连串激情呼喊。但在凌晨三点，公寓外无车流声，大部分柏林人已入眠时，那声音在封闭空间中清晰可辨。

He hadn't heard it in years; not since he had attempted his first sober kiss, and she had out called from a dream for her mother…  
他已有多年未曾听闻；自他尝试第一次清醒的亲吻以来，她便从梦中呼唤母亲的声音……

Instinctively he had let go of her hips and reached out to hold the sides of her face, thumbs carefully wiping away wet trails left on cheeks he couldn't see. He remembered his mind slowly starting to catch up with what was happening as he tried to sooth her with soft words and comforting murmurs, letting his guard down as she had seemingly lowered hers…  
他本能地松开了她的腰，伸手托住她的脸颊，拇指小心翼翼地拭去他看不见的脸颊上留下的湿润痕迹。他记得自己的思绪慢慢跟上正在发生的事情，试图用温柔的话语和安慰的呢喃安抚她，随着她似乎放下了戒备，他也放松了警惕……

…which had left him utterly blindsided to the maelstrom that had followed.  
…这让他对随后而来的狂风暴雨毫无防备。

She hadn't tore at him directly, at least not with clenched fists and open palms, but at everything else around him.  
她没有直接对他动手，至少没有用紧握的拳头和伸开的手掌，而是对周围的一切发泄。

He had long since learned better than to get in her way and had simply waited it out, picking up fallen objects and furniture that hadn't been left ruined in her wake.  
他早就学会了不要挡她的路，只是耐心等待风暴过去，捡起那些在她离去后没有被毁坏的物品和家具。

As he had salvaged, part of him had noticed his devastated bedroom looked eerily similar to the old Geofront after the JSDF had cracked open the underground cavern with N2 mines, giving way for nine white vultures to glide down and ravage the last two defenders of Nerv HQ.  
正如他所挽救的，他的一部分已经注意到他那被毁的卧室看起来与旧 Geofront 惊人地相似，当自卫队用 N2 地雷炸开地下洞穴后，九只白色的秃鹫顺势滑翔而下，对 Nerv 总部的最后两名守卫进行了掠夺。

Her man-made tempest of cross-lingual curses and flailing limbs had just moved onto the living room when a pounding shook his door in it's frame and he scrambled to answer it.  
她那人造的跨语言咒骂与挥舞四肢的风暴刚刚转移到客厅，一阵敲击声便震动了门框，他急忙去应门。

On his doorstep had stood an abashed looking agent of Section 2 (Tom? Leon? Daniel?), backed by a pair of grim-faced _polizei_, a man and a woman. Apparently his neighbors three floors up and two floors down, as well concerned citizens passing on the street had summoned them, while the agent had begrudgingly joined in when they had arrived at the building.  
站在他门口的是一位面带羞愧的第二课特工（汤姆？里昂？丹尼尔？），身后跟着一对表情严肃的警察，一男一女。显然，三楼和二楼下的邻居以及路过的热心市民都报了警，而这位特工不情愿地加入，当他们到达大楼时。

He had been quickly separated from the fuming red head, and after confirming neither of them had been seriously hurt, he had quietly been made to explain the "flare up" as best he could to the male officer. He remembered how his awkward control of the German tongue had been made worse by the feeling of shame that had slid its way into his stomach.  
他很快就被那个怒气冲冲的红发女孩隔开了，在确认两人都没有受重伤后，他不得不尽量向那位男警官解释这场“爆发”。他记得自己笨拙的德语在羞愧感悄然涌入胃中时变得更加糟糕。

Fortunately, it hadn't been too difficult to explain the situation, or at least the end result, since Asuka's tantrums was a well known variable to anyone who crossed her path, and were about as common as rain while varying just as much in severity.  
幸运的是，解释情况并不太难，至少是最终结果，因为明日香的发脾气对任何与她打交道的人来说都是一个众所周知的变数，就像雨一样常见，严重程度也各不相同。

Tonight had merely been a severe storm, not a typhoon.  
今晚只是一场严重的风暴，并非台风。

As the interrogation had wound down, he recalled feeling himself growing angry at the man. He was just doing his job, sure, but he was stranger who knew nothing of their shared past or their struggles.  
随着审讯逐渐接近尾声，他回想起自己当时对这个男人感到愤怒。他只是在履行职责，没错，但他是个陌生人，对他们的共同过去或挣扎一无所知。

Then in an attempt to mollify the officer, he had explained that he occasionally had his own share of tantrums from time to time, but they were rare, almost mythological.  
然后，为了安抚那位警官，他解释说自己偶尔也会发脾气，但这种情况很少见，几乎像是神话传说。

He remembered immediately recognized his misstep as the the officer had sharply looked up at him from his notepad and his hand twitched towards his sidearm. Mortified and shamefaced, he quickly told the man how one their arguments had escalated into something beyond cutesy metaphors, and risen intosomething _real,_ something _primal_.  
他立刻意识到自己的失误，因为警官从笔记本上猛地抬头看向他，手不自觉地向配枪摸去。他感到既尴尬又羞愧，迅速向对方讲述了他们的一次争吵是如何升级，超越了可爱的比喻，变得真实而原始。

There wasn't much to describe about incident: after an argument a few months back he had gotten drunk enough that his red-tinged double-vision had faded into black, and he'd awoken to find his table upended, the rubbery faux-flesh on his prosthetics torn away in ragged strips, and bruises on Asuka's neck.  
那次事件没什么好描述的：几个月前的一次争吵后，他喝得酩酊大醉，原本泛红的重影逐渐变成了漆黑一片，醒来时发现桌子被掀翻，假肢上的橡胶仿肤被撕成了一条条破布，而明日香脖子上留下了淤青。

It hadn't taken much to put two and two together.  
把两件事联系起来并不难。

What he left out of the story, was how afterward they had separated for had seemed like an eternity, and he had managed to stifle much of his drinking by desperately replacing the craving with sugar and caffeine, trading one vice for two. Unfortunately that had left him a jittery mess as he had tremored by a phone that never rang and how she had avoided him at every chance, all while his restless mind replayed every rumor of her seeing other men in an unending loop.  
他没说出口的是，之后他们似乎分开了很久，他拼命用糖和咖啡因来压抑酒瘾，以一种恶习换取两种替代品。不幸的是，这让他变得神经兮兮，颤抖着守着一部从不响起的电话，而她则每次都尽可能避开他，与此同时，他不安的脑海中不断回放着关于她与其他男人交往的种种传闻，形成了一个无休止的循环。

Eventually the loneliness and lurid fantasies had become too much to bare, and he had shivered and shuddered his way to her home before throwing himself on her doormat to await judgment.  
最终，孤独与淫靡的幻想变得难以忍受，他颤抖着、哆嗦着来到她家门前，扑倒在门垫上等待审判。

His sentence had been a tongue-lashing fierce enough to leave the remains of his ego raw and bleeding, proceeded by her riding him with enough to force that he had taken a taxi home rather than hobble. Whatever restraint she shown before out lingering affection or care for his wellbeing was gone, and he had accepted it almost gleefully.  
他的惩罚是一场激烈的训斥，足以让他的自尊心支离破碎，血肉模糊，随后她以一种让他不得不打车回家而非一瘸一拐的方式骑在他身上。无论她之前表现出的克制是出于未了的情愫还是对他的关心，此刻都已荡然无存，而他几乎欣然接受了这个现实。

Then had come his _true_ punishment.  
接着，他真正的惩罚降临了。

That night had been the sixth time, and eventually there had been a seventh, and now would have been the eighth, before he had the mistake of trying to comfort her.  
那一夜已是第六次，最终有了第七次，而现在本该是第八次，在他试图安慰她之前犯了个错误。

But again, it was a such a short and painful tale, though really not that unusual given their history. After all, couples quarreled all the time, right? So why had the cop stared at him like he'd gone mad?  
但话说回来，这故事虽短暂却痛苦，尽管考虑到他们的过往，其实并不算特别罕见。毕竟，情侣们总是争吵不断，对吧？那为什么警察盯着他看，仿佛他疯了一样？

Then the middle aged officerhad sighed heavily and ran his fingers through his blond burr cut before excusing himself to talk briefly with other two outside. The man had returned shortly after, casting another look that seemed to both pity and condemn him, while whispering a few solemn words and an equally curt prophecy.  
随后，那位中年警官重重地叹了口气，手指穿过他金色的短发，然后借口出去与其他两人短暂交谈。他很快就回来了，投来一个既同情又谴责的眼神，低声说了几句严肃的话和一个同样简短的预言。

Then trio had left, leaving him alone holding two pamphlets.  
那三人离开后，留下他独自一人拿着两本小册子。

He remembered flipping through the first pamphlet, his frazzled mind trying to make sense of the advice printed on the nonthreatening color scheme of pink and white.  
他记得翻阅了第一本小册子，他那纷乱的思绪试图理解印在粉白温和配色上的建议。

It had advised him to trust his instincts, to recognize when that he could not "work it out", how to identify and built a support system, pointed him to addresses were others like him were sheltered…all repetitions of the lines that officer that interwoven into their conversation until he dredged up that dreadful memory.  
小册子建议他相信自己的直觉，识别何时无法“解决问题”，如何建立支持系统，指引他到那些庇护与他相似之人的地址……所有这些内容都是那位警官在他们对话中不断提及的，直到他回想起那段可怕的记忆。

The second pamphlet was in a similar vein, speaking of how to identify "stressors" in his life, how evaluate his mood, reframe his thinking and remove himself from situations…again all advice he had heard before from the one or six therapists he had bounced between over the years. All the placid faces of those quacks had long since blended together in his mind and become a meaningless impression.  
第二本小册子同样老调重弹，讲述如何识别生活中的“压力源”，如何评估情绪，重塑思维并抽身于某些情境……这些建议他多年来在不同的心理治疗师之间辗转时早已听过无数次。那些庸医平静的面孔早已在他脑海中混为一谈，变成了一片无意义的印象。

He must of have looked at those papers uncomprehendingly for another eternity before they were abruptly taken from his hands. Dazed, he had stared as she had torn apart his two pamphlet along with three others, before looking up to take in her face.  
他一定又茫然地盯着那些文件看了许久，直到它们突然从他手中被夺走。他茫然地看着她撕毁了他的两本小册子和其他三本，然后抬头凝视着她的脸。

Depleted of fury, Asuka had seemingly shrunken to half her height, with her normally staunch frame hunched over and shaking. Her red rimmed eye set in her blanched skin had made for a sickening sight, more traumatic than any horror show the aborted spectacle of instrumentality had produced.  
怒气消散后，明日香似乎缩水了一半，她平时挺拔的身躯此刻佝偻着，颤抖不已。她那布满血丝的眼睛嵌在苍白的皮肤上，构成了一幅令人作呕的景象，比任何因插入栓实验中止而产生的恐怖场面还要令人心碎。

Despite all of the horrific details that ran counter to everything to what he knew to be Asuka Langley Sohryu, premiere angel slayer and ace Eva pilot("_And don__'t you forget it, idiot!"_), what he remembered most clearly was how she had tried desperately to suppress T_he Sound_ as it wracked her body_…a_nd how she had failed miserably.  
尽管所有这些可怕的细节都与他所知的明日香·兰格雷——顶尖使徒猎手和王牌 EVA 驾驶员（“你这个白痴，别忘了！”）相悖，但他最清晰记得的是她如何拼命压制那在她体内肆虐的声音……以及她如何惨败。

_The Sound_ was less of a singular noise and more an series of torturous notes that alternated between sniffling and whimpering, as if unsure of which to commit to. Regardless of which miserable track was played, tears always accompanied it, devastating her make up, her fragile facade of tenacity, and his heart.  
那声音并非单一的噪音，更像是一系列折磨人的音符，交替着抽泣和呜咽，仿佛不确定该选择哪一个。无论播放哪一段悲惨的旋律，泪水总是随之而来，摧毁了她的妆容，她脆弱的坚韧假象，以及他的心。

He had tried to reach out for her, to comfort her, but she she slapped his hand away, growling as she shielded her throat.  
他曾试图伸手去安慰她，但她却拍开了他的手，低吼着护住自己的喉咙。

_Don__'t hurt me and I won't hurt you._  
别伤害我，我也不会伤害你。

He remembered nodding and trying to speak, but words failed him as he struggled to reassure her he'd never hurt her. But he knew the sentiment was a lie. Everything he had ever done or do only seemed to wound her.  
他记得自己点了点头，试图开口说话，但在努力向她保证自己绝不会伤害她时，却发现自己说不出话来。然而他心里清楚，这份承诺是个谎言。他所做的一切，似乎都只是在伤害她。

She watched his blundering in silence, then turned and walked out the apartment. He had stumbled after with impotent excuses, not daring to touch her, leaving him unable to stop her as she jumped into her red bullet of car and raced off into the night.  
她默默地看着他笨拙的举动，然后转身走出了公寓。他跌跌撞撞地跟在后面，无力的借口脱口而出，却不敢触碰她，只能眼睁睁看着她跳进那辆红色的小车，疾驰消失在夜色中。

It was sight of her tear-streaked face fading into the darkness which had truly broken him, and finally forced him to do something, _anything_.  
正是她泪痕斑斑的面容逐渐消失在黑暗中的景象，真正击碎了他的心，最终迫使他采取行动，无论做什么。

"What are you waiting for?"  
“你还在等什么？”

He snapped out of the reverie that had overtaken him and internally cursed as the present reasserted itself.  
他从那占据心头的沉思中猛然惊醒，内心暗自咒骂，现实再次占据了上风。

The soft light granted him a perfect view of Asuka's half-clothed body, as lithe and firm as the hazy impressions he had gleaned in the dark.  
柔和的光线让他得以清晰地看到明日香半裸的身体，那身姿如同他在黑暗中模糊印象般纤细而坚实。

Here she was, finally laid out before him, just as he had planned for, yet he couldn't find it in himself to be happy.  
她终于如他所计划的那样展现在他面前，然而他却无法从中找到一丝喜悦。

The muscles in her legs were taught, looking as if they had been sculpted from stone instead of living tissue, and the muscles in her jaw and around her eyes were just as stiff, constricting her features into a snarl. The entirety of her being seemed dedicated more to imitating a wound up spring made of skin and bone than the a audacious woman he had grown to love over these past five years.  
她腿部的肌肉紧绷，仿佛是由石头而非活生生的组织雕刻而成，而她下颌和眼周的肌肉也同样僵硬，使她的表情扭曲成一种怒容。她的整个存在似乎更像是用皮肤和骨骼模仿一个紧绷的弹簧，而非他过去五年里逐渐爱上的那位大胆女子。

The sight made him miserable, but he had expected this, and before he could talk himself down, he reached out and began to massage the rock-like muscle in her left calf, trying to knead it back into flesh.  
这景象让他感到痛苦，但他早有预料，未等自己说服自己放弃，他便伸出手，开始按摩她左小腿上坚如磐石的肌肉，试图将其揉回柔软的肌肤。

"What the hell are you doing?"  
“你到底在搞什么鬼？”

He ignored the bite in her words and continued his ministration.  
他无视她话语中的尖锐，继续着他的按摩。

"I'm massaging you." "我在给你按摩。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

He considered the question, trying to form his next words in such a way that wouldn't be interpreted as a slight or snark. He settled on being honesty.  
他思考着这个问题，试图组织语言，以免被误解为轻蔑或嘲讽。最终，他决定坦诚相待。

"I know you don't trust me, or believe in me. You have every reason not to," he said, "But please, allow me to spoil you a bit, because you deserve it, more than anyone I know. I want to make things up to you."  
"我知道你不信任我，也不相信我。你有充分的理由不这么做，"他说，"但请允许我稍微宠爱你一些，因为你值得，比我认识的任何人都值得。我想弥补你。"

Shinji waited with baited breath, bracing for a lashing.  
真嗣屏息以待，准备承受一顿责骂。

Fortunately, the planets must have aligned at the very moment because not only did she not lash out, but instead _blushed._ There was little time to appreciate the sight as the planets immediately flew along on their celestial paths and the blush reverted back into a scowl, just as quickly as it had appeared.  
幸运的是，那一刻行星似乎恰好对齐了，因为她不仅没有发火，反而脸红了。还没来得及欣赏这一幕，行星便沿着它们的轨道迅速移动，那抹红晕也迅速变回了怒容，出现得快，消失得也快。

However, he was certain he had seen it and he felt confidence surge through him, urging him onward as he moved onto and up the other leg, stopping to pay equal attention to her thick thighs.  
然而，他确信自己看到了那一瞬的红晕，这让他信心倍增，催促着他继续前行，移步到另一条腿上，同样细致地关注她那健壮的大腿。

He did the best job he could given he was down to one hand, and that blessedly that was enough since she hadn't stopped him yet and the the firmness under his grip finally seemed on the verge softening.  
尽管他只剩一只手可用，但他尽了最大努力，幸运的是这已经足够，因为她并未阻止他，而他握住的那份坚定似乎终于开始软化。

Then his hand brushed the bottom of her shirt, which extended just past the bottom of her pelvis, and he immediately ceased his massage.  
随后，他的手触到了她衬衫的下摆，那下摆刚好延伸到她骨盆的下方，他立刻停止了按摩。

She hadn't put on the panties during their post-coital respite, leaving him to confront a shaded view of a trimmed red hairs above a pair of slightly parted lips. He'd already been there, or rather, _in_ there, but actually seeing her womanhood bared before him, even partially, was simply daunting_._  
她在事后休息时没有穿上内裤，让他面对着修剪整齐的红色毛发下微微分开的唇瓣的朦胧景象。他之前已经到过那里，或者说，进入过那里，但实际看到她的私密之处展现在他面前，哪怕是部分展露，也着实令人胆怯。

He looked up at her, silently praying to whatever celestial bodies were watching to favor him again.  
他抬头望向她，默默祈祷着任何在注视的天体能再次眷顾他。

Her piercing gaze examined him like that of wolf eying another beast of prey…then she slowly curled back the hem of her shirt upwards, just three inches, stopping at just above the red patch.  
她锐利的目光像狼审视另一头猎物般打量着他……然后她缓缓将衬衫下摆向上卷起，仅三英寸，停在红色斑块上方。

His hand slid along the outside of her left leg, slowly reaching inward to to junction where hip met pubic mound.  
他的手沿着她左腿外侧滑过，慢慢向内探去，直至髋骨与耻骨隆起交汇之处。

He extended his thumb, and ran it through the cropped stubble, enjoying the feel of it. His thumb trailed down further, brushing against her clitoral hood and carefully pulling it back.  
他伸出拇指，在短短的胡茬上摩挲，享受着那种触感。拇指继续下滑，轻触她的阴蒂包皮，并小心翼翼地将其拨开。

She hissed and he instantly withdrew.  
她倒吸一口气，他立刻收手。

"I'm still s-sensitive, you idiot!" she growled, "I'm not some loose whore you can just fist at will! Do it right this time!"  
“我还很敏感，你这个白痴！”她咆哮道，“我不是你随便就能粗暴对待的荡妇！这次给我做对了！”

He nodded, curling back all but two fingers, concentration split between the task before him and the tremors that threatened to wrack his entire body and expose his fear.  
他点头，将手指蜷缩至仅剩两根，注意力在眼前的任务与即将席卷全身的颤抖之间分裂，后者暴露了他的恐惧。

His fingers entered her and he was surprised to find it was warmer than he had expected, almost feverishly so, and it felt more sticky than actually wet. That said, what wetness there was only allowed him up to his second set of knuckles before he encountered friction.  
他的手指进入她体内，惊讶地发现比预想的更温暖，几乎热得像发烧，而且感觉更粘稠而非湿润。尽管如此，那点湿润只让他深入到第二关节处便遇到了阻力。

He retracted his fingers and drew upon what little knowledge he had culled from locker room talk and the few videos he had seen when the need for release had almost overwhelmed him.  
他收回手指，凭借从更衣室闲聊和少数几次急需释放时看过的视频中汲取的有限知识，努力应对。

Feeling her eye still on him, he tried again with even more caution, and to his disappointment, but to no great surprise, the friction persisted, and his efforts were still awkward, even with the excuse that he was using his off-hand.  
尽管感觉到她的目光依旧停留在他身上，他再次尝试，更加小心翼翼，然而令他失望却并不意外的是，摩擦依旧存在，他的努力仍然笨拙，即便有借口称他在使用非惯用手。

Their foreplay up until then had been thoroughly one sided, usually consisting of a few of brief pecks and a curt hand-job on her part, both of which were always harsh and insistent, but the minimal requirement to get him hard enough so she could impale herself. Any attempts on his part to his reciprocate had been met with growls and nails sinking into his wrists.  
在那之前，他们的前戏完全是单方面的，通常包括她短暂的几下亲吻和草率的手活，总是粗暴而急切，但这是让他硬起来以便她能自我满足的最低要求。他试图回应的任何尝试都遭到了她的咆哮和指甲深深陷入他手腕的回应。

Lack of practice aside, the other problem was that no matter what he did, she twisted and squirmed with some opposing motion that left him fumbling and on the verge of constantly saying "sorry" as he tried to compensate.  
除了缺乏练习之外，另一个问题是无论他怎么做，她都会扭动和蠕动，做出相反的动作，让他手忙脚乱，几乎不停地想说“对不起”，同时试图弥补。

"Stop." "停下。"

He halted, feeling his already flagging courage recede further while the tremors intensified.  
他停下脚步，感觉到自己本已衰退的勇气进一步消退，而颤抖却愈发强烈。

"I can't expect a dumkompf like you to do this right the first time," Asuka said, rolling her eye.  
“我不能指望你这种笨蛋一次就能做好，”明日香说，翻了个白眼。

He fought the urge to protest, to make some excuse, but to his surprise she reached down and gripped his wrist.  
他强忍住抗议的冲动，想找个借口，但出乎意料的是，她弯下腰握住了他的手腕。

"Watch, then do what I tell you."  
"看着，然后照我说的做。"

He watched, mesmerized as she used her two fingers to spread her outer lips, giving him a view of the interior.  
他目不转睛地看着，她用两根手指分开外唇，让他得以窥见内里。

The trance wavered as he noticed her walls were slightly chafed, the natural pink blending with inflamed red.  
他的恍惚状态因注意到她的壁面略显擦伤而动摇，自然的粉红与发炎的红色交融。

_Knowing her, she__'s probably ignoring whatever pain she's feeling and would blow me off if I asked about it. Should I stop now?_  
以她的性格，大概正无视着身上的疼痛，我要是问起来，她肯定会敷衍过去。我现在该停下来吗？

Guilt threatened to overwhelm him, but he suppressed showing his worry as looked up to see her looking off to the side, a much gentler shade of red once again spreading through her cheeks. This time however, the color didn't retreat.  
愧疚感几乎要将他淹没，但他强压下担忧，抬头望去，只见她目光飘向一旁，脸上再次泛起柔和的绯红。然而这一次，那抹颜色并未消退。

If she were in pain, she'd already made it quite clear that she'd stop him, and now she was practically inviting him to continue.  
如果她感到疼痛，她早已明确表示会让他停下，而现在她几乎是在邀请他继续。

"…_Slowly p_ut in your index finger about two inches, then curl it, _carefully_ until you feel sort of a rough spot. Then rub the tip of your finger against it, back and forth."  
“……慢慢地将你的食指伸进去大约两英寸，然后弯曲它，小心地直到你感觉到一个粗糙的地方。然后用指尖来回摩擦它。”

Shinji did as she instructed, reaching just beyond the point where he had stopped before and feeling the texture she described. He stroked lightly and she suddenly shuddered, eye wide and wild while her chest heaved upward.  
真嗣按照她的指示去做，伸到了之前停下的位置之外，感受到了她描述的质感。他轻轻地抚摸着，她突然颤抖起来，眼睛睁得大大的，狂野而激动，胸部也随之向上挺起。

He almost withdrew, but her hold on him held.  
他几乎要抽回手，但她的握持让他无法动弹。

Then she let loose a long and heavy sigh, and gradually her chest sagged back down along with the rest of her body.  
随后，她发出了一声长长的、沉重的叹息，渐渐地，她的胸部随着身体的其他部分一起松弛下来。

"A-alright, I guess you don't suck at this," she murmured, "Now put in your middle finger, and _slowly_ start moving your fingers in and out. Finger me, don't _finger-fuck_ me."  
“好吧，看来你还不算太差，”她低声说道，“现在把中指放进去，慢慢地开始来回移动。用手指抚摸我，别用手指猛戳我。”

Again he obeyed, deliberately working his sticky fingers along roof of the tunnel. To his growing delight, the motion became smoother as her walls clenched and moisture built up around his touch, and the stiff muscles in her legs slackened as she sank deeper into the mattress.  
他再次顺从地照做，故意用粘腻的手指沿着通道的顶部滑动。令他越发欣喜的是，随着她体内的紧缩和湿润感的增加，动作变得更加顺畅，她紧绷的大腿肌肉也随着她更深地陷入床垫而放松下来。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

The sensual undercurrent in her tone made a streak of lightning race down his spine and into his groin. Her impertinent gaze lowered to where the lightning had struck and petrified flesh, but it was a unfocused, lacking true distaste.  
她语气中的性感暗流如同一道闪电，划过他的脊椎，直抵下体。她那无礼的目光随之落在了被闪电击中并僵化的部位，但眼神却是模糊的，并未流露出真正的厌恶。

"Yes, Asuka?" "是的，明日香？"

"…Tell me I'm a great pilot."  
“……告诉我，我是个伟大的飞行员。”

He hesitated, feeling an unsettling feeling slither into the back of his mind, but he forced it away as he noticed her left hand tweaking a bump rising through the fabric of her shirt.  
他犹豫了一下，感到一种不安的情绪悄然爬上心头，但当他注意到她左手正拨弄着衬衫下逐渐隆起的凸起时，便强迫自己将这感觉抛诸脑后。

"Asuka, you're _more_ than a great pilot, you're the _best,__"_ he said with genuine sincerity,_"_Everyone's always known you were. Even without the angels, people still rely on you to te_"_  
"明日香，你不只是一个伟大的驾驶员，你是最好的，" 他真诚地说道，"大家一直都知道这一点。即使没有使徒，人们依然依赖你来提醒他们……"

The Second Child (or rather, _Second Adult_, he reckoned) let loose a throaty groan at his words and her hand moved up his wrist to place his thumb back on her clitoris. He pressed down gently without being told, tenderly caressed it with as much care as he would his own member.  
第二适任者（或者说是第二成年人，他这么认为）对他的话发出了一声低沉的呻吟，她的手移到他的手腕上，将他的拇指放回她的阴蒂上。他没有被要求就轻轻按下，温柔地抚摸着，就像对待自己的性器官一样小心翼翼。

"I…_ah,_ I-" "我……啊，我-"

The tendons in legs grew taught again as her back began to arch and she started rising off the bed, but he held on, keeping a loose grip on her pelvis in what he could only describe as an intimate sort of handshake.  
她的腿部肌肉再次紧绷，背部开始拱起，身体逐渐离开床面，但他紧握不放，以一种近乎亲密的握手方式，松松地抓住她的骨盆。

Then her shirt started to slide down, uncovering the rest of her pelvis…and the canvas of crinkled and discolored skin that was her navel.  
随后，她的衬衫开始滑落，露出了她骨盆的其余部分……以及那块布满皱褶和变色皮肤的肚脐。

She slammed her hips to sheets, legs snapping together so fast that his slick hand was forced out.  
她猛地将臀部砸向床单，双腿迅速并拢，以至于他湿滑的手被迫抽出。

He shuffled backward, bracing himself for a foot to strike out and flatten his nose, or heaven forbid, the onset of another "flare up".  
他向后挪动，准备迎接一脚踢来将他的鼻子踩扁，或者更糟糕的是，又一场“爆发”的开始。

To his surprise however, neither scenario came to pass. Instead, she flung herself onto her side, head snapping down to bury themselves between knees drawn to her chest, her ankles interlocked.  
然而，令他惊讶的是，这两种情况都没有发生。相反，她猛地侧身躺下，头迅速低下，埋在蜷缩至胸前的膝盖之间，脚踝紧紧相扣。

Her hands grabbed at the hem of shirt in a white knuckled grip and tried to wrap the rest of her body in it. Her efforts were in vain as the shirt proved too short, leaving her rump and the soles of her feet exposed.  
她双手紧紧抓住衬衫下摆，指节因用力而发白，试图用衬衫包裹住身体的其余部分。但衬衫太短，她的努力徒劳无功，臀部和脚底依然暴露在外。

All in all, it was a disturbingly perfect demonstration of the fetal position.  
总的来说，这是一个令人不安的完美胎儿姿势展示。

Her muffled voice came out a flat, passionless monotone, easy to dismiss as being devoid of any inflection. But in that non-tone he could distinguish the all-too-familiar timbre of self loathing with overwhelming certainty.  
她那被压抑的声音以一种平淡无波的单调传出，很容易被忽视为缺乏任何语调。但在那无起伏的语调中，他可以毫无疑问地辨别出那再熟悉不过的自我厌恶的音色。

"I'm disgusting." “我真恶心。”

He retorted back almost out of instinct.  
他几乎是本能地反驳道。

"You're not ugly! You're-"  
"你并不丑！你是——"

"Shut up!" she hissed, "Just shut up, Third Child! I've had enough of your lies!"  
"闭嘴！" 她低声怒斥，"别说了，三少爷！你的谎话我已经听够了！"

Her words triggered a sudden burst of anger to erupt in his chest, almost causing him to double over.  
她的话突然引爆了他胸中的怒火，几乎让他痛得弯下腰来。

_She__'s doing it again! Shoving aside my feelings! Must it always be a fight with her?_  
她又在这样做了！无视我的感受！难道和她之间永远都只能是争吵吗？

He sucked in a deep breath and brushed way selfish thoughts, counting backward in his head as had learned from recent classes. This wasn't about his feelings, he _knew_ how he felt. This was was about her, not him, that lashing out.  
他深吸一口气，摒弃了自私的念头，像最近课堂上所学的那样，在心里倒数。这不是关于他的感受，他清楚自己的情绪。这是关于她，不是他，那番咄咄逼人的言辞。

He crawled forward and laid down facing her huddled form. Then he extended his hand, pausing only for a moment before he grasped her shoulder.  
他匍匐前进，面对着她蜷缩的身影躺下。随后他伸出手，仅在片刻停顿后便抓住了她的肩膀。

Focusing all of his willpower on keeping his voice steady, he spoke the words he'd practiced in the mirror for the last two weeks.  
他集中全部意志力，努力保持声音平稳，说出了过去两周在镜子前练习过的话。

"You are Asuka, the greatest Eva pilot there ever was or will be, and the only person I can relate to on this entire planet. I know you don't think so right now, but you are beautiful, intelligent and you excel at everything you put your mind too. You're everything I wish was and more."  
“你是明日香，有史以来最伟大的 EVA 驾驶员，也是这个星球上唯一能让我产生共鸣的人。我知道你现在不这么想，但你美丽、聪明，无论做什么都能出类拔萃。你是我所希望的一切，甚至更多。”

He took another breath through his nose, the deepest yet.  
他又深吸了一口气，这次是最深的一口。

"Asuka, I love you…and I want you, _all of you._ I couldn't bare having anything less than that. If you want me to want you, then _show_ me."  
“明日香，我爱你……我想要你，全部的你。我无法忍受任何一点缺失。如果你希望我渴望你，那就向我展示吧。”

Monologue finished, Shinji swallowed thickly, suddenly unsure of what to do.  
独白结束后，真嗣艰难地咽了咽口水，突然不知该如何是好。

He had finally spoken his mind, finally expressed the feelings that had been boiling inside him for years. But now what? What would he do if she rejected him? Would he press on and try again, against her wishes?  
他终于倾吐了心声，终于表达了多年来在他心中翻腾的情感。但现在呢？如果她拒绝了他，他会怎么做？他会不顾她的意愿，继续尝试吗？

_No,_ he though, _I__'ll probably slink out her apartment and into the bar across the street. I haven't closed my tab there yet, and everybody already knows my name._  
不，他想，我可能会悄悄离开她的公寓，走进街对面的酒吧。我在那里还没结账，而且大家都已经认识我了。

So embroiled was he in his thoughts, that he almost didn't catch her body unfurling and turning to face him.  
他如此沉浸在自己的思绪中，以至于几乎没注意到她的身体舒展开来，转向了他。

Her face from forehead to jaw was a roiling riptide of emotions, a convulsing display of spasming muscle almost too fast for him follow. Impassioned crosscurrents rippled and crashed against each other, forming new whirlpools of tension and undertows of stress with such ferocity that he was left stupefied as he watched it as tried to resolve resolve itself.  
她的脸从额头到下巴，情绪如汹涌的激流般翻腾，肌肉痉挛的展示快得让他几乎跟不上。激情的交叉涌流波纹起伏，相互撞击，形成新的紧张漩涡和压力暗流，其猛烈程度让他看得目瞪口呆，试图理解这一切如何自我化解。

Then the raging frenzy suddenly ceased; skin and muscle, tendon and cartilage, falling slack as one. Her entire presence seemed to grow still, becoming disturbingly placid and calm.  
然后，狂暴的疯狂突然停止；皮肤、肌肉、肌腱和软骨，一起松弛下来。她的整个存在似乎变得静止，变得异常平静和安宁，令人不安。

He waited. 他等待着。

Underneath the stillness, he could hear teeth begin to grind together behind pursed lips, the sound akin to the bottoms of boats scraping bedrock, and a low howl started to radiate from her throat like a distant storm-wind.  
在表面的静谧之下，他能听到紧闭的双唇间牙齿开始摩擦，那声音如同船底刮擦着基岩，而她喉咙里则开始发出低沉的嚎叫，宛如远方风暴的呼啸。

"Get off the bed. Stand up."  
“下床。站起来。”

He obeyed. 他遵从了。

On the bed, Asuka extended her legs and shuffled to sit at the edge. Pale hands rose to remove the eye patch covering her left eye, then proceeded to lift the shirt and throw both at his head.  
在床上，明日香伸直双腿，挪动着坐到床边。苍白的手抬起，摘下了遮住左眼的眼罩，接着掀起衬衫，将两者一起扔向他的头部。

He let the shirt envelop him, obscuring his sight as as she whispered to him in a true monotone vacant of all of feeling, even of resignation.  
他任由衬衫包裹住自己，视线被遮挡，而她用一种真正单调、毫无感情，甚至没有一丝无奈的语气对他低语。

"Look at me," She whispered, "Look at what happens _Invincible Shinji_ is too late to save _Poor Little Asuka_."  
“看着我，”她低声说，“看看无敌的真嗣来不及拯救可怜的小明日香时会发生什么。”

Shinji started to pull off the top, but he slowed and used the chance to school his features, forcing them into a neutral expression.  
真嗣开始脱掉上衣，但动作放缓，趁机调整表情，强迫自己摆出一副中立的神态。

Over the years, he had gotten glimpses of what he was about to see, and had long observed the emotional toll this it had exacted on her, driving her to cover herself even on the most blistering of days and subsequently threaten anyone that dared suggest she dress otherwise.  
多年来，他曾瞥见过即将展现在眼前的景象，并长久地观察到这一幕对她情感造成的沉重负担，促使她在最酷热的天气里也遮掩身体，进而威胁任何胆敢建议她换装的人。

He took in a third breath, removed the shirt, and finally confronted what their childhood victory had wrought on his lover.  
他第三次深呼吸，脱下衬衫，终于直面童年胜利给爱人带来的后果。

Her torso and abdomen were a patchwork of rope purple scars that garishly clashed with her naturally pale skin in some madman's interpretation of plaid. Each scar was interlaced with some number of gouges and indents that bore the distinct impressions of bite or claws. One particular series of holes ran from under and over the middle of left breast and almost all the way to the top of sternum, as if a leather worker had taken a hole puncher to her. The teat itself was missing a nipple and held a faded incision in it's place.  
她的躯干和腹部布满了紫色的绳状疤痕，这些疤痕在她天生苍白的皮肤上显得格外刺眼，仿佛某个疯子对格子图案的扭曲诠释。每一道疤痕都交织着若干抓痕和凹陷，留下了明显的齿痕或爪印。特别是一串孔洞，从左乳房下方延伸至上方，几乎直达胸骨顶部，宛如皮革工匠用打孔器在她身上留下的痕迹。乳头本身缺失了一个，取而代之的是一道褪色的切口。

Her arms had fared better, thought that seemed a small consolation. The upper arms bore most of the crisscross of marks and furrows, while the lower arms up held wrinkled splotches of dark red.  
她的手臂状况稍好，尽管这似乎只是微不足道的安慰。上臂布满了交叉的痕迹和沟壑，而下臂则布满了深红色的皱褶斑点。

He couldn't help but cringe as he tried to imagine the pain she must of suffered during the butchery and what must of been an excruciating recovery. His own mutilation had been pristine in comparison, a simple lancing that had destroyed everything from his knuckles to his rotary cuff, leaving just enough to warrant a few agonizing salvage attempts…  
他忍不住皱眉，试图想象她在遭受这种残害时所承受的痛苦，以及那必定是极其痛苦的恢复过程。相比之下，他自己的伤残显得干净利落，只是一次简单的刺穿，从指关节到旋转肌袖都被摧毁，只留下足够多的部分，让人不得不进行几次痛苦的抢救尝试……

But this…There was a grotesque brutality in her disfigurement that left him feeling nauseous…and made the edges of his vision tinge with red.  
但这个……她的毁容中有着一种扭曲的残忍，让他感到恶心……也让他的视野边缘泛起了红色。

His eyes settled on her face, taking in the final scar that stretched from her left eyebrow down to top of her cheekbone. The perfect replica that was her false eye stared blankly as the rest of her countenance warped into a wounded snarl.  
他的目光停留在她的脸上，注视着从她左眉延伸到颧骨顶端的最后一道伤疤。她那只假眼空洞地凝视着，而她的面容其余部分则扭曲成痛苦的咆哮。

"Is this what you want? All of _this_?" she said, voice escalating to a howl, "You don't want me! You're a liar! You're a fucking-"  
“这就是你想要的吗？这一切？”她的声音逐渐升高，变成了嚎叫，“你不是想要我！你是个骗子！你他妈的——”

Despite the years anticipating this moment, despite his ineffective attempts to open up during therapy, despite counting backwards and taking deep breaths, he couldn't restrain the _sheer rage_ from seeping into his own voice.  
尽管多年来一直期待着这一刻，尽管他在治疗中尝试敞开心扉却收效甚微，尽管他倒数呼吸、深呼吸，他还是无法抑制那股纯粹的愤怒渗透进自己的声音。

"I wish I could kill them."  
“我真想杀了他们。”

"-ward…" she stared him, snarl morphing to confusion, "What?"  
“-ward…”她盯着他，咆哮转为困惑，“什么？”

His hand snapped through the air gesturing at distant phantoms only he could see. They swirled across his vision, always out of reach, taunting him from behind the veil of death.  
他的手在空中猛地一挥，指向那些只有他才能看见的遥远幻影。它们在他的视野中盘旋，总是遥不可及，从死亡的面纱后嘲弄着他。

"_Them!_ Everyone that did this," He growled at the spirits, drawing upon the mantra that had held him together over the years, "Those mass produced bastards. Seele. Ritsuko. _My_ _father_, _my mother!_ All of them! They _all_ had a hand in this! They used _us!_ They hurt _you!_ I-"  
“他们！每一个参与此事的人，”他对着那些幽灵咆哮，借助多年来支撑他的咒语，“那些批量生产的混蛋。Seele。律子。我的父亲，我的母亲！所有人！他们都插手了这件事！他们利用了我们！他们伤害了你！我——”

He snatched at the apparitions and suddenly the room was wavering, shuddering, reeling, violently careening like the planet had been unchained from it's solar warden and was rollicking through the void, taking it's children with it.  
他猛地抓住那些幻影，突然间房间开始摇晃，颤抖，颠簸，剧烈地摇摆如同行星被解开了太阳的束缚，在虚空中狂奔，带着它的孩子们一起。

Some baffled part his mind noted that he couldn't hear sirens, or cries of panic, or much of anything except his blood pounding into his skull. Some other part of him tried to make sense of it and only grew more bewildered.  
他脑海中某个困惑的部分注意到，他听不见警笛声，也没有恐慌的呼喊，除了血液撞击头骨的声音，几乎什么都听不到。他的一部分试图理解这一切，却愈发感到困惑。

_We aren__'t in Japan. There shouldn't be earthquakes. This is Germany. Floods. Land slides._  
我们不在日本。这里不该有地震。这是德国。洪水。山体滑坡。

He gripped at the air and his nails scraped something that didn't yield. He threw himself up (or maybe down?), at wherever it was and slammed his shoulder against something hard.  
他紧抓着空气，指甲刮到了什么坚硬的东西。他猛地向那个方向扑去（或许是向下？），肩膀重重地撞上了某个坚硬之物。

The world gradually stopped spinning, but his mind and the hairs in his inner ear took their sweet time following suit.  
世界渐渐停止了旋转，但他的思绪和内耳的毛发却慢慢悠悠地才跟上节奏。

In the wind down, he swayed and realized that he hadn't fallen or flown, but had managed to kneel one one knee, and was leaning against a wall.  
在缓过神来时，他摇晃着意识到自己既没有跌倒也没有飞翔，而是单膝跪地，倚靠在墙边。

Steadying himself, he looked around and saw Asuka staring at him, mouth agape.  
稳住自己后，他环顾四周，看到明日香正目瞪口呆地盯着他。

She sat rigidly, deathly still except for her heaving chest.  
她僵硬地坐着，除了剧烈起伏的胸膛外，一动不动。

_What happened? She__'s not hurt, is she?_  
发生了什么？她没受伤吧？

He stepped forward and reached for her, questions rising in his throat. She shrank back, raising her arms in front of her face.  
他向前一步，伸手去扶她，喉咙里涌出疑问。她却退缩了，举起双臂挡在脸前。

Confused, he stopped as pain suddenly pulsed up his arm. He looked down the limb, and took in bloodied nails, caked with dust and paint chips.  
困惑中，他因手臂突然传来的剧痛而停下。他低头看向那只手，只见指甲沾满血迹，混杂着灰尘和漆片。

He flexed the hand and staggered again as he tried to stand. His eyes crossed the room sluggishly, and across from his shoulder he saw four distinct channels in the drywall—four ragged scars in pink paint.  
他试着伸展手指，再次踉跄着试图站稳。他的目光迟缓地扫过房间，从肩头望去，对面墙上的石膏板上留下了四道明显的痕迹——四条参差不齐的粉色漆痕。

Nausea welled up in being as he snapped his attention to Asuka. Even while fighting his disorientation, he could clearly feel the terror radiating off her.  
当他猛地将注意力转向明日香时，一阵恶心涌上心头。即便在努力克服眩晕感的同时，他也能清晰地感受到她散发出的恐惧。

He scrutinized her face, and in the mirror of her widened pupil, he saw a memory.  
他仔细审视着她的脸庞，在她的瞳孔放大如镜中，他看到了一段记忆。

_He was looking through the eyes of a stranger, no, his vision was narrow, too bestial, too tinged with red. He was looking out from inside a beast that was shaped like a man, stooped into a wild crouch, ready to lunge. The monster was in his living room, back when his hand-carved table had still stood as symbol of his pride, and it also was reflected in Asuka__'s eye, looming in her vision._  
他透过陌生人的眼睛看去，不，他的视野过于狭窄，过于野性，过于血红。他仿佛身处一个形似人却如野兽般佝偻、蓄势待发的怪物体内。这个怪物曾出现在他的客厅，那时他手工雕刻的桌子还象征着他的骄傲，而此刻，它同样映在明日香的眼睛里，在她眼前若隐若现。

_The world lurched as the creature sprang forward choking her and she was clawing at it gouging out chunks of flesh that didn__'t bleed and revealed not flesh and veins and arteries but steel and gears and wires!_  
当那怪物猛扑向前，扼住她的喉咙时，世界仿佛在摇晃。她拼命抓挠，撕下一块块不流血的肉，露出的不是肌肉、血管和动脉，而是钢铁、齿轮和电线！

_The animal snarled and leaned in as Asuka__'s face started to shift from red to purple. He could see it clearly now in her eyes, promising to be the last thing she ever saw._  
那动物咆哮着，身体前倾，使得明日香的脸色从红转紫。他清楚地看到她眼中的景象，预示着这将是她最后所见。

Recognition slammed into him like an angel falling to earth.  
仿佛天使坠落凡间，他瞬间认出了对方。

_The Animal! The Beast! The Berserker! It__'s me! I'm it! We're the same!_  
是野兽！是狂战士！是我！我就是它！我们本为一体！

It was then that he knew his revelation to be the truth, and the truth to be self-evident.  
就在那时，他明白了自己的启示是真实的，而真相是不言而喻的。

It had always been with him, in him, _being_ _him._ It had been lurking behind his face ever since he'd been a child abandoned on a train platform, crying out for a man who had cast aside the mantle of "father". For years it had laid dormant, waiting as he had passed his life away under the dutiful gaze of _Sensei_, and finally stirring when he had received that accursed letter calling him to Tokyo-3.  
它一直与他同在，在他体内，成为他的一部分。自从他还是一个被遗弃在火车站台上哭泣的孩子，渴望着一个抛弃了“父亲”身份的男人以来，它就潜藏在他的面孔之后。多年来，它在师父尽责的目光下悄然潜伏，等待着他度过一生，直到收到那封诅咒般的信件，召唤他前往第三东京。

It had gorged itself over those harrowing months, taking hold whenever an angel arrived to try and destroy them, relishing in the bloodbaths while he had cowered and left it to rage.  
在那段艰难的岁月里，它贪婪地吞噬着一切，每当有使徒降临试图毁灭他们时，它便紧紧抓住机会，在血腥屠杀中狂欢，而他则畏缩一旁，任由其肆虐。

And when their enemies had all died or been gunned down, it had naturally turned on the only recurring source of pain in his life…  
当他们的敌人全都死去或被枪决后，它自然转向了他生命中唯一反复出现的痛苦来源……

A weak groan escaped his lips as the light of comprehension pierced outward from within his mind, burning away layers of willful ignorance and the curtain of red overlaying his vision.  
一声虚弱的呻吟从他唇间逸出，随着理解的曙光从内心迸发，烧毁了层层故意的无知和覆盖他视野的红色帷幕。

He sagged under the truth, kneeling until his forehead pressed against the carpet. The short brown fibers twisted in his trembling fists, threatening to tear away as he struggled with a world that now made too much sense.  
他在真相的重压下瘫软，跪倒在地，直到额头紧贴着地毯。短小的棕色纤维在他颤抖的拳头中扭曲，仿佛随时会撕裂，因为他正与一个如今变得过于清晰的世界抗争。

"I…I've hurt you too," he admitted, "I…violated you in the hospital, jerked off on your sleeping body cause wouldn't wake up and scream at me, when you wouldn't make feel like the piece of shit I was!"  
"我……我也伤害了你，"他承认道，"我……在医院里侵犯了你，对着你沉睡的身体自慰，因为你不会醒来对我尖叫，不会让我觉得自己是那堆烂泥！"

The world lurched again and he cried out as the memories shifted in his mind. Memories of murder, of self loathing, of defilement.  
世界再次倾斜，他痛哭失声，记忆在他的脑海中翻腾。谋杀的记忆，自我厌恶的记忆，亵渎的记忆。

"And I so absorbed in my own damn self-pity that I didn't get there they had started _eating_ you."  
"而我沉浸在自己的自怜自艾中，以至于没注意到他们已经开始对你下手了。"

His mind was becoming a whirling kaleidoscope of transgressions: passive aggressive remarks, women spoken to in secret, his hand stretched forth to silence.  
他的思绪变成了一幅旋转的万花筒，充斥着种种越轨行为：被动攻击性的言论，对女性私下里的交谈，以及那只伸出去试图沉默的手。

"Then I choked you. I-I was so pissed that wouldn't just let me love you, that you couldn't move on from what happened and just accept things. You acted like the bitch I wanted in the hospital but you never punished me enough…you never _validated_ the work I put in to run from it all."  
“然后我掐住了你。我——我当时气疯了，你不愿意让我爱你，你无法从发生的事情中走出来，只是接受现实。你表现得像我在医院里想要的那种婊子，但你从未足够惩罚我……你从未认可我为了逃离这一切所付出的努力。”

"I'm sorry, Asuka," he rasped, "I'm so fucked up. _I__'m the one whose disgusting!_"  
“对不起，明日香，”他嘶哑地说，“我真是糟糕透顶。我才是那个令人作呕的人！”

He screamed out the last words, nearly vomiting them.  
他尖叫着吐出最后的话语，几乎要将它们呕出。

In their wake followed silence.  
随后，寂静尾随而至。

Time likely passed by him, but it meant little to him. He was an utter wretch, the lowest of the low who deserved nothing but contempt, and he could wait an eternity for his judgment or for his body to rot into dust.  
时间或许在他身边流逝，但这对他已无足轻重。他是个彻头彻尾的可怜虫，低贱至极，只配受到鄙视，他可以等待永恒的审判，或是等待自己的身体化为尘土。

Then there came the rustling of sheets and soft padding of feet.  
随后传来了床单的窸窣声和轻轻的脚步声。

The feet stopped just short of his head, and for one deliciously sick moment he fantasized that they'd crash into his skull, sending his brains and splinters of bone to splatter across the room like Unit-03's had over that gore soaked highway oh so many years ago.  
那双脚停在了离他头部不远处，有那么一瞬间，他病态地幻想它们会猛地撞上他的头骨，让他的脑浆和碎骨片像多年前三号机在那条血染的公路上那样四溅开来。

"Get up." "起来。"

He stood on legs that threatened to buckle and splinter, keeping his eyes locked on blood-free carpet.  
他站在那里，双腿颤抖着仿佛随时会折断，双眼紧盯着没有血迹的地毯。

A hand wrapped around his throat, steadily squeezing until his windpipe closed and he had to rely on the air trapped in his lungs to keep conscious.  
一只手紧紧箍住他的喉咙，逐渐施压直至气管闭合，他只能依靠肺中残留的空气维持意识。

But still, he didn't dare look up and he didn't bother resisting the verdict.  
然而，他依旧不敢抬头，也无意反抗这既定的判决。

Then the hand let go and pushed against his chest, forcing him to stagger backwards.  
随后那只手松开，推搡着他的胸膛，迫使他踉跄后退。

He reflexively choked and gagged, throat spasming as it tried to reopen.  
他本能地哽咽和干呕，喉咙痉挛着试图重新打开。

And even though there was thunder in his ears, he could still hear the familiar words fall on him.  
尽管耳边雷声隆隆，他仍能听到那些熟悉的词句落在自己身上。

"Clean yourself up," she said flatly, "Then get on the bed."  
“把自己收拾干净，”她平淡地说，“然后上床去。”

She laid there in the dark, facing what she knew to be his bare back.  
她躺在黑暗中，面对着她知道是他赤裸的背部。

She could've ordered him to put clothes on, but the contrast between his nudity and her clothing gave a distinct sense power and separation. After all, only beast slept without clothing, trusting their hides to save them from the fangs of predators.  
她本可以命令他穿上衣服，但他赤身裸体与她衣着整齐之间的对比，却赋予了一种明确的力量感和距离感。毕竟，只有野兽才会裸睡，相信自己的皮毛能保护他们免受捕食者尖牙的伤害。

He resting on his empty shoulder, motionless, making him perfectly parallel to the mattress.  
他靠在没有枕头的肩膀上，一动不动，身体与床垫完全平行。

As time crawled by, she absently wondered if could he feel the sheets against network of circuitry or if needed the arm attached.  
随着时间缓缓流逝，她不经意间思索，他是否能感受到床单与电路网络的接触，还是需要那只附着的机械臂。

What if fibers got caught in the hole, or it got dirty? Would he have to undergo surgery again? Why did they bother spending so much time and money building something that could just be taken off and thrown away?  
如果纤维卡在孔里，或是脏了怎么办？他是否得再次接受手术？他们为何要花费那么多时间和金钱去制造一个可以轻易拆卸丢弃的东西？

And why was she worried for an animal like him?  
而她为何要为一个像他这样的生物担忧？

She listened to his shallow breathing, knowing that he was listening in turn to hers.  
她听着他浅浅的呼吸声，知道他也在倾听她的。

Finally he stirred, revealing himself to be awake.  
最终他动了动，显露出自己已经醒了。

She jabbed him the ribs with a finger, cutting off what she knew to be another apology.  
她用手指戳了戳他的肋骨，打断了他即将出口的道歉。

"Third Child?" “第三子？”

"Yes, Asuka?" "是的，明日香？"

The voice was soft and devitalized, the complete opposite of his normally anxious grousing, or the ear-splitting roars he had displayed earlier.  
那声音轻柔且毫无生气，与他平日里焦虑的抱怨或是先前震耳欲聋的咆哮截然相反。

Despite the tempest within, she thoroughly _loathed_ seeing him so lifeless, so disgustingly submissive and doll-like.  
尽管内心风暴肆虐，她却极其厌恶看到他如此死气沉沉，如此令人作呕地顺从，宛如一个没有生命的玩偶。

She turned on the light.  
她打开了灯。

"Turn around." "转过身来。"

He obeyed without comment and she felt her hatred grow.  
他一言不发地照做了，她感到自己的恨意愈发浓烈。

"Look at me." “看着我。”

He hesitated, then looked, and she felt her hatred wane.  
他犹豫了一下，然后看了过来，她感到自己的恨意在消退。

"Did you mean what you said…about my body…about loving me?"  
“你说的那些话……关于我的身体……关于爱我……是真心的吗？”

He answered immediately, a hint of steel shining dully beneath the fatigued tone.  
他立刻回答，疲惫的语调下隐约透出一丝坚定。

"I meant every word of it," he said, "…Even back then…when I was choking you…I thought about what would happen if you actually died…and that's what stopped me."  
"我每一句话都是真心的，" 他说，"…即使在那时…当我掐住你的时候…我想过如果你真的死了会怎样…正是这个念头阻止了我。"

She gritted her teeth as she imagined what an idiot like him would do without her to make sure to prop him up.  
她咬紧牙关，想象着像他这样的傻瓜如果没有她来确保支撑他会做出什么蠢事。

"And what would you do? Find another pretty face that looked like mine and replace me? I bet you could find plenty of redheads if you skipped over to what's left of Ireland."  
"那你又会怎么做？找一个长得像我的漂亮脸蛋来替代我？我敢打赌，如果你跳到爱尔兰的残余之地，一定能找到不少红发女郎。"

He shook his head. 他摇了摇头。

"No, I'd just kill myself," he answered simply, "With you gone, what would I do? Try and live with the guilt? I've killed angels, but not people…not yet anyway."  
“不，我宁愿自杀，”他简单地回答，“你不在了，我还能做什么？带着愧疚活下去吗？我杀过天使，但还没杀过人……至少现在还没有。”

A sigh passed his lips and he seemed to wilt without actually moving.  
他叹了口气，虽然没有动，但整个人似乎都蔫了下去。

She internally growled at how nonchalantly he talked around taking his own life. Idiot and animal though he was, he had no right to deprive her of the only person she could talk openly to about Evas, about her scars, about how her attempts to retriieve her mother, about the upcoming war, about…well, _everything_.  
她内心咆哮着，对他如此轻描淡写地谈论自杀感到愤怒。尽管他既愚蠢又野蛮，但他没有权利剥夺她唯一能坦诚交谈的人——关于 Eva，关于她的伤疤，关于她试图找回母亲的尝试，关于即将到来的战争，关于……好吧，关于一切。

Her sudden awareness of that point clenched at at something in her chest, but she forcibly willed the grip to break it's hold.  
她突然意识到这一点，胸口仿佛被什么东西紧紧抓住，但她强行让这股束缚松开。

"-ot strong like you, Asuka," he continued, "Besides, apparently they've made enough advances with the dummy plug system that they could easily replace me with if they built mo-"  
"不像你那么坚强，明日香，"他继续说道，"而且，显然他们在模拟插件系统上已经取得了足够的进展，如果他们再制造一个，就能轻易取代我——"

She struck out, jabbing two fingers into his ribs.  
她突然出手，用两根手指戳向他的肋骨。

"Don't you dare kill yourself, Third Child," She hissed, "Don't you even dare _talk_ or _think_ about doing it. Understand?"  
"你敢自杀试试，三少爷，"她低声咆哮，"连想都别想。明白吗？"

"You're mine," her hand raised to grip his neck for emphasis, "I own you and I'll decide _if_ and _when_ you die. Got it?"  
"你是我的，"她抬起手，用力抓住他的脖子以示强调，"我拥有你，你的生死由我决定。懂了吗？"

His head started to decline in placation, but she pressed her lips against his before he could finish the motion.  
他正要低头妥协，但她在他完成这个动作之前，抢先吻上了他的唇。

He floundered for a moment, clearly taken aback, but she persisted and soon he melted into the kiss.  
他一时手足无措，显然是被惊到了，但她坚持不懈，很快他就融化在了这个吻中。

They continued to meld together, taking in short rasping breaths between bouts, until she put a hand behind his head and pushed him downward.  
他们继续融合在一起，在接吻的间隙中急促地喘息，直到她将一只手放在他的头后，将他向下推。

He didn't resist, but she was actually glad for it as his mouth made it's way down to her collarbone, and over her covered scars until he eventually found her remaining nipple.  
他没有反抗，但她其实为此感到庆幸，因为他的嘴一路向下，经过她的锁骨，越过她覆盖的伤疤，最终找到了她剩下的乳头。

She gasped as he sucked greedily through the cloth, and all tension seemed to leave her body in a ragged sigh.  
她倒抽一口气，他贪婪地透过布料吮吸，所有的紧张似乎都随着她粗重的叹息从身体中消散。

"Asuka, you're beautiful," he gasped between kissing and sucking, "You've always been and you always will be."  
“明日香，你真美，”他在亲吻和吮吸间喘息道，“你一直都很美，而且永远都会是。”

"O-Of course I am!" She snapped out of reflex, but was too engrossed to put any bite behind the words.  
“我当然美！”她本能地反驳，但过于投入以至于话语中没有丝毫锋芒。

Meanwhile his hand went about exploring the outside of of leg. The initiative was unprompted and almost intrusive, but again she felt as if he were finally reading her intent, and her body.  
与此同时，他的手开始探索她大腿的外侧。这一举动突如其来，几乎有些冒犯，但她再次感觉到他似乎终于读懂了她的意图，以及她的身体。

She shuffled forward and felt something hard and throbbing slide up against her pelvis, and in turn s he lifted her knee and experimentally rubbed it against the underside of rod.  
她向前挪动，感觉到一个坚硬而跳动的东西贴上了她的骨盆，她也随之抬起膝盖，试探性地摩擦着那根杆的下侧。

He rasped, hand jerking to brush against the inside curve of her thigh and where an obscene throbbing had started to develop.  
他沙哑地说道，手猛地一抽，触碰到了她大腿内侧的曲线，那里正开始涌动着一股淫靡的跳动感。

Her leg rose higher, kneecap digging against something that yielded and squished under the pressure.  
她的腿抬得更高，膝盖骨压在某个柔软且在压力下发出噗嗤声的东西上。

"Careful, idiot, I could emasculate you at any moment."  
“小心点，傻瓜，我随时都能让你失去男子气概。”

"It doesn't matter. I belong to you. I want to make you happy." he moaned, "Use me, _please._ I don't care how."  
“没关系。我属于你。我想让你开心。”他呻吟道，“请使用我吧。我不在乎方式。”

She ceased her impromptu testing as she mulled over the request.  
她停下了即兴的测试，沉思着这个请求。

Things were moving too fast again, just like the first time they had fucked, shortly after he had drunkenly her kissed in that alley, nearly chipping her front teeth in process.  
事情再次进展得太快，就像他们第一次做爱时那样，就在他在那条小巷里醉醺醺地吻了她之后不久，差点把她的门牙都磕掉了。

Her heart and her pussy were still chafed from earlier, but even though the earlier round of revelations had left her feeling wrung out, she was now vitalized by his touch and admittedly _yearned_ for it.  
她的心和私处仍因先前的事而感到不适，但尽管之前的种种揭露让她感到筋疲力尽，此刻他的触碰却让她焕发了活力，并且不可否认地渴望着。

_I should kick him out of bed and make him take the train naked, and only then would I consider whatever pathetic apology he tries to throw together.  
我应该把他踢下床，让他光着身子去赶火车，只有那样，我才会考虑他那可怜兮兮拼凑起来的道歉。_

The thought held it's own appeal, but hadn't there been enough cruelty already, from both of them? What was the point of hurting each other more when there was pleasure right here, waiting to be seized?  
这个想法自有其吸引力，但难道他们之间的残忍还不够多吗？既然眼前就有愉悦等待着被抓住，再互相伤害又有什么意义呢？

And aside from that, she supposed this could be considered make up sex, and that was something adults did all the time right? Something like this wasn't really that unusual given their history.  
除此之外，她想这或许可以算是和解性爱，成年人不也经常这么做吗？考虑到他们的过往，这种事其实并不算太出格。

In a matter of heartbeats, she had made her decision.  
在几下心跳之间，她已做出了决定。

She fully withdrew her knee, leaving him in a temporary limbo of suppressed whimpers.  
她完全收回了膝盖，让他陷入了短暂的压抑呜咽之中。

Then she quickly grabbed his shoulders and maneuvered him so that she under him.  
随后她迅速抓住他的肩膀，将他挪动到自己上方。

It still felt galling to be on the bottom, but if he wanted to be used by her, then he could do the work.  
尽管处于下位仍让他感到不甘，但若他想被她所用，那么他可以承担这份工作。

He stared down at her with half-lidded gaze that made her insides clench pleasantly as she undressed, throwing the clothes to the floor before she could change her mind.  
他半眯着眼凝视着她，那目光让她在脱衣时内心愉悦地紧缩，衣服被她抛向地面，以免改变主意。

"Finish what you started."  
“完成你开始的事。”

Half-formed words were stammered but discontinued, then were substituted with an eager nod.  
半成形的词语结结巴巴地吐出，却又戛然而止，随即被一个急切的点头所替代。

He started to reach out towards the desk, whose sole drawer was still open from earlier, but she gripped his wrist and guided it to the source of her inescapable aching.  
他开始伸手向书桌，那唯一的抽屉还因早先的匆忙而敞开着，但她紧握住他的手腕，引导它触向她无法摆脱的痛楚之源。

"No condom." “没用避孕套。”

"But-" “但是——”

She used her other hand to grab his chin and force him to look at her.  
她用另一只手抓住他的下巴，强迫他看着她。

"If you're going to cum, I want to fucking _feel_ it. No tricks, no sleight of hand and _no more running away_. Now start fucking."  
“如果你要射，我要实实在在地感受到。别耍花招，别玩什么障眼法，也别再逃避。现在开始干。”

He gave another nod, this one solemn, taking a moment line himself up with her, then finally parted her glistening lips with his cock.  
他又点了点头，这次神情庄重，稍作调整对准她，最后终于用他的阴茎分开她湿润的阴唇。

She hissed as he filled her, gripping his shoulders in order not to get swept up in the swell of pleasure that threatened to carry her away.  
她嘶嘶作声，随着他的充实而紧抓他的肩膀，以免被那即将将她卷走的愉悦浪潮所吞没。

Rather than the friction she was used to (and had perhaps feared), he slid in with ease, sending sparks to skitter madly up her spine and into her brain, then back again.  
与她习惯（或许也害怕）的摩擦不同，他轻松滑入，激起火花沿着她的脊椎疯狂跳跃，直冲大脑，然后又回转。

"You alright, Asuka?" He asked with concern, "Um, that was just half."  
“你还好吗，明日香？”他关切地问，“呃，这才一半。”

She bobbed her head in a sluggish nod, and he cocked a grin.  
她缓缓地点了点头，而他则咧嘴一笑。

"I-I'm fine, I just need to adjust," she said, swatting his shoulder, "And don't you dare smile! I'm not saying you're big or anything!"  
"我-我没事，只是需要调整一下，"她拍了拍他的肩膀，"你敢笑！我可不是在说你大什么的！"

She wriggled her hips and nearly hissed again as his shaft scraped against that locus of heat within her, as well as several new points that she had never managed to reach with fingers alone.  
她扭动着臀部，几乎又要倒吸一口气，因为他的坚挺在她体内那炽热的焦点上摩擦，还触及了几个她从未能仅凭手指触及的新位置。

And above it all was her self-satisfied partner, apparently happy to be useful for once.  
而她那位自鸣得意的搭档，似乎终于感到自己派上了用场，显得颇为高兴。

She scowled at the smugness, and in one smooth motion wrapped her legs around his back and drew him forward in a decisive thrust.  
她对着那副得意洋洋的样子皱了皱眉，随即利落地用双腿环住他的背部，果断地将他拉向前，进行了一次有力的推进。

Asuka grunted at her self-induced impalement, closing her eye and savoring just how _full_ she felt. The burning sensation of overtaxed muscle was still there, but it was distant, buried under waves of her pleasure that radiated out from her core.  
明日香因自己的主动而发出一声闷哼，闭上眼睛，享受着那种充实感。肌肉过度劳累带来的灼热感依然存在，但已经变得遥远，被从核心散发出的愉悦浪潮所掩盖。

She opened her eye and found Shinji was on verge of swooning, features twisted in naked bliss. The cocky grin had been stolen from his face and now belonged to her.  
她睁开眼，发现真嗣正濒临昏厥，面容因赤裸裸的极乐而扭曲。那自负的笑容已从他脸上消失，转而属于了她。

"Are _you_ alright, Third Child?"  
“你还好吗，第三适格者？”

"I-I'm fine, y-you're just _amazing,__"_ he moaned,_"_God, Asuka, this…this is _unfair._"  
“我、我没事，你、你真是太厉害了，”他呻吟道，“天啊，明日香，这……这不公平。”

Her smirk faltered at the honesty, and she decided to reward him by clenching down on his member. He let loose another moan, then a reluctant whine, and she took the opportunity to test just how much she could squeeze out of him.  
她的轻笑因这份坦诚而动摇，决定奖励他，于是紧缩着夹住他的那物。他随即发出又一声呻吟，接着是不情愿的哀鸣，她趁机测试自己能从他身上榨取多少。

She clenched, clenched and constricted with almost intoxicating glee. He tried to pull back, tried to go forward, but her well toned legs and pussy proved to be vice he couldn't break, leaving him to shudder and writhe impotently in her grip.  
她紧握、收缩，带着近乎陶醉的喜悦。他试图后退，试图前进，但她那锻炼得当的双腿和私处却如铁钳般无法挣脱，让他只能在她的掌控下颤抖、无力地扭动。

"Stop squirming. I'll tell when you're allowed to move."  
“别乱动。我会告诉你什么时候可以动。”

Most of his body stopped like clockwork, but his hips betrayed him with small spasms that teased out even more pleasure from her honeyed trap. She allowed the transgression, and put her hands behind her head, basking in his helplessness. It seemed so obvious to her now, but sex could be downright _fun_ with someone under curled around her finger, or rather, with her legs curled around them.  
他的身体大部分都像上了发条般静止了，但他的臀部却背叛了他，不时地抽搐，从她甜蜜的陷阱中诱发出更多的快感。她默许了这一越界行为，将双手枕在脑后，享受着他的无助。现在对她来说似乎再明显不过了，与一个完全受她掌控的人做爱，简直是乐趣无穷，或者说，是她双腿环绕着他们。

"Shinji…" "真嗣…"

His hips stilled, perhaps noticing the use of his name.  
他的臀部静止了，或许是注意到了自己名字的提及。

"Yes, Asuka?" "是的，明日香？"

"Tell me everything you love about me."  
“告诉我你爱我的一切。”

Like earlier, he answered immediately.  
和之前一样，他立刻回答了。

"I love the way the sun shines through your hair. I love that collect you degrees like how other people collect shoes. I love when you smile and when you laugh and when-"  
“我喜欢阳光透过你头发的样子。我喜欢你像别人收集鞋子一样收集学位。我喜欢你微笑、大笑，还有——”

"Enough" She whispered, relaxing her legs, "Start moving."  
“够了。”她轻声说，放松了双腿，“开始动吧。”

He did, and perhaps it was out of cowardice or maybe restraint, but he moved agonizedly slow despite the lust that radiated from behind his glassy blue eyes.  
他确实这样做了，或许是因为怯懦，又或许是克制，尽管他那玻璃般湛蓝的眼眸后散发着欲望，他的动作却痛苦地缓慢。

She bit back a complaint as he quickly started to pick up speed, and was forced to admit that allowing him to move on his own felt good, _damned_ good.  
她忍住了抱怨，随着他迅速加快动作，她不得不承认，让他自由行动的感觉很好，该死的好。

But it was more than that. _Damned good_ was shifting into _pretty_ _great_ which quickly shifted _fucking incredible_ at a speed that was leaving her breathless, converting her entire body was turning into live wire that thrummed with channeled ecstasy.  
但这不仅仅是好。该死的好正迅速转变为相当棒，然后以令她喘不过气的速度变成了难以置信的棒，她的整个身体仿佛变成了通电的导线，充满了被引导的极乐。

She tried to reign in the pulsating energy but it was too widespread for her to do anything but be overwhelmed.  
她试图控制那股汹涌的能量，但它太过广泛，她只能被其淹没。

Sweat threatened to spill down her from her eye and her cheek, and she wiped it away in annoyance.  
汗水眼看就要从她的眼角和脸颊滑落，她烦躁地将其抹去。

_Fuck! Who am I kidding? I__'m crying! But why? Why am I crying!_  
该死！我这是在骗谁呢？我在哭！但为什么？我为什么要哭！

Her lax in control allowed her traitorous throat to let loose a whimper and soon a sniffle took the opportunity escape from her nose.  
她控制不力的喉咙不禁发出了一声呜咽，紧接着一个抽泣趁机从鼻子里溜了出来。

Shinji hastily stopped, mouth opening to spill out concern.  
真嗣急忙停下，张嘴就要表达关切。

"Asuka? Am I hurting you? I can st-"  
“明日香？我弄疼你了吗？我可以停——”

She dammed his mouth with a hand to stop the flow of words, the worry in them somehow making her want to cry more.  
她用手堵住他的嘴，阻止了话语的流淌，那些话语中的担忧不知怎的让她更想哭了。

"I-I'm fine, you idiot! It's just…like I said, it's just a lot to take in," she said with a sniff, "And I just…I just…"  
“我——我没事，你这个笨蛋！只是……就像我说的，只是有点难以接受，”她带着鼻音说道，“而我只是……我只是在……”

His anxious features softened and her hand fell away to wipe off the tears.  
他焦虑的神情缓和下来，她的手也随之放下，擦去了泪水。

"I hate feeling like this," she seethed, "Only children cry."  
"我讨厌这种感觉，"她咬牙切齿地说，"只有小孩子才会哭。"

He shook his head, and awkwardly leaned back so he could help her wipe her face without toppling over.  
他摇了摇头，笨拙地向后靠，以便在不摔倒的情况下帮她擦脸。

"Asuka, it's normal to cry when things are…too much. I cried when the doctors said you might not make it out of surgery," he said softly, "Hell, I even cried when you left Japan without me!"  
"明日香，当事情变得……难以承受时，哭泣是很正常的。当医生说你可能无法从手术中挺过来时，我也哭了，"他轻声说道，"见鬼，你离开日本不带我走时，我也哭了！"

"I know you did! You always cry when I get hurt or when I leave you behind! Don't do that!" she yelled, "I don't _need_ anyone to worry about me and I don't anyone to lean on me! I'm Asuka! The greatest Eva pilot there ever was and an adult that makes others look idiots! I don't need to be _coddled_!"  
"我知道你会这样！每次我受伤或把你抛下时，你总是哭！别这样！" 她喊道，"我不需要任何人担心我，也不需要任何人依赖我！我是明日香！史上最伟大的 EVA 驾驶员，一个让其他人显得愚蠢的成年人！我不需要被溺爱！"

He opened his mouth to protest, but shut it with the distinct _click_ of teeth on teeth.  
他张开嘴想要抗议，但随即闭上了，发出明显的牙齿碰撞声。

Then he did something she had never allowed him to do, even after tumultuous courtship had ended, something that had always been quickest to anger her whenever he attempted it.  
然后他做了她从未允许他做的事，即使在激烈的追求结束后也是如此，每当他尝试时，总是最快激怒她的事。

He slipped his hand under her back and held her against him.  
他悄悄地将手滑到她的背后，将她拥入怀中。

She froze, unsure of how she should respond.  
她僵住了，不确定该如何回应。

She could return the hug…but that would be the same as showing weakness, essentially admitting that she accepted his so called "love", that she needed him. Alternatively, she could excuse it as just her using him in a different way, and not disclose her intent, but she already had given up on being spiteful…at least for now.  
她可以回抱他……但这无异于示弱，本质上承认了她接受他所谓的“爱”，她需要他。或者，她可以将其解释为以另一种方式利用他，而不透露自己的意图，但她已经放弃了怨恨……至少现在是这样。

The debate continued in her head until she noticed his warmth of body seeping into her, suffusing and breaking down the body-wide network of tension.  
辩论在她脑海中持续，直到她注意到他身体的温暖渗透进来，弥漫全身，打破了那遍布全身的紧张网络。

_I__…I just want to feel good, don't eye? If that means being weak, then only he would know. It'd be a secret only we would share, like so many others._  
我……我只是想感觉好些，不是吗？如果这意味着变得脆弱，那么只有他才会知道。这将是我们之间又一个共享的秘密，就像许多其他秘密一样。

She carefully coiled her arms around his neck and wrapped her legs tighter around his waist, returning the embrace with everything she could.  
她小心翼翼地用双臂环住他的脖子，双腿更紧地缠绕在他的腰间，尽其所能地回抱他。

"Don't ever let me go. Don't ever leave me alone." She whispered, "Never stop holding me."  
"永远不要让我走。永远不要让我独自一人。" 她低语，"永远不要停止拥抱我。"

"I never will." "我永远不会。"

"Promise me, Shinji. I'll never forgive you if you don't."  
"向我保证，真嗣。如果你不这样做，我永远不会原谅你。"

He stilled, and for a moment some feral part of her contemplated reversing course and finally returning the favor of being choked.  
他静止不动，有那么一瞬间，她内心野性的一面考虑着改变方向，最终回报他曾经掐住自己的恩惠。

_He__'s thrown the arm away and you've already got yours around his neck. It'd be so easy, just like they showed you in traini-_  
他已经甩开了手臂，而你已经将手臂环绕在他的脖子上。这太简单了，就像他们在训练中教你的那样——

Suddenly he lifted her, leaning back as he pulled her forward until he was kneeling and she was straddling his lap.  
突然间，他抱起她，向后倾斜，同时将她拉向前，直到他跪下，而她跨坐在他的大腿上。

The swift change in position caused a dizzying array of sensations to crash through her mind and clear out all thought, violent or otherwise.  
位置的迅速变化让她脑海中涌入一阵令人眩晕的感觉，将所有思绪——无论是暴烈的还是其他的——一扫而空。

He tilted his head back, gripping her chin, and looked into her eye with such intensity that she almost shied away from it.  
他仰起头，紧握她的下巴，目光如此强烈地凝视着她的眼睛，以至于她几乎想要避开。

"Asuka Langley Sohryu, I promise, no, I _swear_ that as long as I'm alive I'll never allow you be alone," He vowed, "I love you, all of you. I want to be with you, here, now, and forever."  
“惣流·明日香·兰格雷，我发誓，只要我活着，就绝不会让你孤单一人，”他郑重承诺，“我爱你，你的全部。我想要与你在一起，此时此地，直到永远。”

She blinked rapidly, holding back more tears that threatened to escape.  
她快速眨眼，强忍着不让更多泪水涌出。

_How is able to do this to me?  
他怎么能这样对我？_

She quickly buried her head into the nook of his neck, indulging in his scent and the touch of his skin against hers.  
她迅速将头埋进他颈间的凹陷处，沉醉于他的气息和肌肤相触的感觉。

"Only an idiot like you could love me."  
"只有像你这样的傻瓜才会爱上我。"

"Guess I'm just a fool in love then," he said, "But I'm your fool."  
"那我大概就是个恋爱中的傻瓜吧，" 他说，"但我是你的傻瓜。"

She couldn't help but giggle into his neck at the corny comeback.  
她忍不住在他脖子上咯咯笑了起来，被这老套的回话逗乐了。

"You can be real cheesy sometimes. You know that, Shinji?"  
"你有时候真是够老套的，知道吗，真嗣？"

His answer was swift, voice taking on a deep tone dripping with faux-smoothness.  
他的回答迅速而干脆，声音变得低沉，带着一种假装的圆滑。

"It ain't easy being cheesy."  
"做个老套的人可不容易。"

She giggled again and swatted him on his back.  
她又咯咯笑了起来，轻轻拍了拍他的背。

"Alright, alright, that's enough out of you."  
“好了，好了，你够了。”

She hugged tighter, and they stayed like that, merely holding each other and enjoying the simple contact.  
她抱得更紧了，他们就这样待着，仅仅拥抱着彼此，享受着这份简单的接触。

For how long did she hold him? She didn't know and didn't care. Time and pride became meaningless concepts in his embrace, inferior to the peace that she was engulfed by and relished in.  
她究竟抱了他多久？她不知道，也不在乎。在他的怀抱中，时间和自尊变得毫无意义，远不及她所沉浸并享受的宁静。

The power of that ever-present serenity continued to hold her in it's grip…until she felt the fleshy spear that impaled her begin to soften.  
那份始终存在的宁静力量继续紧紧拥抱着她……直到她感觉到那根贯穿她的肉矛开始软化。

She squirmed in protest, grinding against him, and she grumbled in irritation.  
她不安地扭动着表示抗议，紧贴着他磨蹭，嘴里不满地嘟囔着。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

She took in a deep breath, then lifted her head to look at him.  
她深吸了一口气，然后抬起头来看着他。

_I can__'t keep letting him put me on the defensive._  
我不能再让他一直让我处于防守状态了。

"Listen, I _refuse_ to beg, so I'll only say this once: I want you to fuck me, Shinji Ikari. For real this time."  
听着，我不打算乞求，所以这话我只说一次：我要你真真正正地干我，碇真嗣。

He smiled, and nodded with determination.  
他微笑着，坚定地点了点头。

"Alright." "好的。"

She sighed, gyrating her hips from side to side, invigorating flesh that begun to wilt.  
她叹了口气，扭动着臀部左右摇摆，唤醒了开始萎靡的肉体。

"And don't start slow this time…I'll follow your lead."  
“这次别再慢慢来了……我会跟着你的节奏。”

His hand gripped her rear and lifted her, before letting her down while he thrust upward. She compensated by quickly figuring out a rhythm of his strokes and bouncing in time with them.  
他的手紧握住她的臀部，将她抬起，随后放下，同时他向上挺动。她迅速适应，找到了他抽动的节奏，随之上下弹跳。

The world around them dimmed then melted away as her room turned into a musky sauna filled the lurid _smacks_ of wet flesh on flesh.  
周围的世界渐渐暗淡，随后融化消失，她的房间变成了一个充满麝香气息的桑拿房，回荡着湿漉漉的肉体撞击声。

The Wave, the true one, was upon her again, rearing back as it climbed to it's peak. But this time she didn't try and force it, didn't wait for it like a petulant child, but instead rode with it, and let it envelop her in all consuming ecstasy.  
真正的浪潮再次向她袭来，蓄势待发，攀向顶峰。但这次她没有试图强行控制，也没有像任性的孩子一样等待，而是与之共舞，任由那吞噬一切的极乐将她包围。

She looked at her lover and was taken aback at how utterly lost in euphoria he looked, and she felt her own features unwillingly mirror his shameless display.  
她望着她的爱人，被他那完全沉浸在狂喜中的神情惊到，不由自主地，她的表情也映射出了他那毫不掩饰的喜悦。

Feeling suddenly self conscious, she relinquished one her holds on his back and hid behind her hand.  
突然感到一阵自我意识，她松开了他背上的一个拥抱，用手遮住了自己。

The grip on buttocks tightened as Shinji spoke between gasps and thrusts.  
随着真嗣在喘息和冲刺间的话语，对臀部的抓握更加紧了。

"A-Asuka, I was serious…when I said I wanted to see your face. Please…don't hide from me."  
"A-明日香，我是认真的……当我说的我想看到你的脸。请……不要躲着我。"

She peeked between her fingers.  
她透过指缝偷看。

"Y-you look stupid," she half chided, half groaned, "Do I really feel that good?"  
"你看起来傻乎乎的，"她半是责备半是呻吟地说，"我真的有那么好吗？"

His grimace shifted into a smile.  
他的愁容转变成了微笑。

"You do…and you like you're enjoying yourself too."  
"你确实……而且看起来你也很享受。"

"S-shut up!" "闭——闭嘴！"

"Show me your face…or I'll stop fucking you."  
"让我看看你的脸……否则我就不干了。"

She growled at the threat.  
她对着威胁低吼。

"You wouldn't dare." "你不敢的。"

His bucking began to slow, just by the barest of margins, but enough that she agonizedly bounced off-rhythm.  
他的颠簸开始放缓，仅是微乎其微的幅度，但足以让她痛苦地失去节奏。

"Fine!" “好！”

She dropped her hand and returned it to his back. The bucking immediately picked up, surpassing it's original speed and making him reach deeper inside her.  
她放下手，重新放回他的背上。颠簸立刻加剧，超越了最初的频率，使他更深入地进入她体内。

"_Gott_, Shinji! Mach weiter! Faster!"  
"天哪，真嗣！继续！快点！"

Her language faculties struggled to keep up with the sheer ecstasy she experienced with each rebound. The language of his body was all that she really needed, but she felt world had to know just how _incredible_ she felt.  
她的语言能力在每一次回弹带来的极度快感中挣扎着跟上。他的身体语言是她真正需要的全部，但她觉得世界必须知道她感觉有多么不可思议。

She dug her nails into his back, digging into him almost as fiercely as he was into her, and he flagrantly groaned in a mix of pain and pleasure.  
她用指甲深深嵌入他的背部，几乎和他深入她一样激烈，他则肆无忌惮地呻吟着，混合着痛苦与愉悦。

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

"_Scheiße! Kami! Shinji!"_ "该死！神啊！真嗣！"

She somehow managed to squeeze down with her what remaining control she had and something in her body finally gave way.  
她不知怎的设法用她仅存的控制力挤压下去，体内的某个东西终于撑不住了。

The wave she had mentally been riding finally crested and surged forth, and she managed to scream before it drowned out her voice and senses in euphoria. Her pussy convulsed sporadically and another wave followed suit, physical and just as intense, gushing from within her and leaking out the imperfect seal they had formed with their hips. A moment she his own hot release erupt inside her, almost searing her already burning pussy, before being swept into the flood.  
她心中一直驾驭的浪潮终于达到了顶峰，汹涌而出，她在声音和感官被狂喜淹没之前勉强尖叫了一声。她的私处不规则地痉挛着，紧接着又一波浪潮随之而来，同样强烈而具体，从她体内喷涌而出，从他们用臀部形成的不完美密封中渗出。片刻间，她感受到他炽热的释放在她本已燃烧的私处爆发，几乎灼伤了她，随后便被卷入了洪流之中。

She shuddered, continuing to contract around him, milking him of his remaining seed as he gave a final few thrusts that jostled the few thoughts that hadn't been washed away by her orgasm.  
她颤抖着，继续在他周围收缩，榨取他剩余的精华，而他最后几下冲刺摇晃着那些未被她高潮冲走的思绪。

Gradually the flood lessened, leaving her empty of reason and strength. She absently noted that her body was going limp, but he caught and cradled her, clinching her to him.  
渐渐地，洪流减弱，她变得理智和力量全无。她不经意地注意到自己的身体正在瘫软，但他接住了她，将她紧紧抱在怀中。

For a time all she knew was the after shocks of that long awaited climax and the heartfelt embrace that held her against him, and she liberally indulged in both.  
一时间，她所感受到的只有那久候的高潮余韵和紧贴着他的真挚拥抱，她尽情地沉浸在这两者之中。

Somewhere infinitely close, she heard Shinji murmur her name again and again like some holy chant or mantra.  
在某个无比接近的地方，她听到真嗣一遍又一遍地低声呼唤她的名字，宛如某种神圣的颂歌或咒语。

Then he was kissing her, over and over, the soft caresses seeking to imprint his love on her skin. She returned the kisses, surpassing his intensity as she left her marks on him in turn.  
随后他开始亲吻她，一次又一次，温柔的触碰试图将他的爱意烙印在她的肌肤上。她回应着这些吻，甚至超越了他的热情，同样在他身上留下自己的印记。

They continued their impassioned attempts to meld into each other, until finally the streets outside stirred with life, and darkness gave way to twilight.  
他们继续着这激情四溢的尝试，试图融为一体，直到最终外面的街道开始苏醒，黑暗让位于暮色。

As she had expected, Asuka awoke to find her cunt feeling battered and hollow.  
正如她所预料的，明日香醒来时发现自己的私处感到疼痛且空虚。

However, what she hadn't anticipated was the arm snaked between her breasts and securing her to a warm body.  
然而，她未曾预料到的是，一条手臂缠绕在她的双峰之间，将她紧贴在一个温暖的躯体上。

There was also the usual lack of cold sweat making her clothes stick to her skin. In fact, she wasn't even wearing any clothing, just the thin blanket that served to guard her against the occasionally brisk summer night.  
此外，她也没有像往常那样因冷汗而让衣服黏在皮肤上。事实上，她甚至没穿任何衣物，只有一条薄薄的毯子为她抵御偶尔凉爽的夏夜。

The blanket did however cling to her as her clothes would have, though the dried sweat that covered her wasn't just her own.  
然而，毯子如同她的衣物一般紧贴着她，尽管覆盖在她身上的干涸汗水并非仅属于她自己。

She groaned through a parched throat and quickly discovered that she also physically exhausted; an profound sense of weariness that pervaded her muscles and seemed to be rooted in her very bones.  
她透过干涩的喉咙发出呻吟，并很快发现自己身体极度疲惫；一种深沉的倦怠感渗透进她的肌肉，仿佛扎根于骨髓之中。

Thankfully her mind was surprisingly alert and not struggling to separate dream from reality as it normally would have on waking. If there had been nightmares, they must've the mild ones of phantom dismemberment, and not of a hanging pair of feet swinging from north to south.  
幸运的是，她的头脑异常清醒，醒来时并未像往常那样挣扎于梦境与现实之间。如果说有噩梦，那必定是些轻微的幻肢解体，而非悬挂在南北之间摇摆的双脚。

_Alright, Asuka, think! What exactly happened? You tested the obnoxious new machine interface at HQ and went home. Then Shinji came over wanting to talk about-  
好了，明日香，想想！到底发生了什么？你在总部测试了那台讨厌的新机器界面，然后回家了。接着真嗣过来，想谈关于——_

Her recollection stopped as the body behind her stirred, letting go of her as it yawned and grumble.  
她的回忆戛然而止，因为身后的身体动了动，松开了她，一边打哈欠一边咕哝。

She heard the bed frame squeak softly as the mattress shifted, followed by a familiar series of crackles and pops.  
她听到床架轻轻吱嘎作响，床垫随之移动，紧接着是一连串熟悉的噼啪声。

The Third Child, no, the _Third Man_, shambled into her peripheral vision, balance offset by the lack of an arm, but he made due.  
第三子，不，第三位男子，蹒跚地进入她的视线边缘，因失去一条手臂而平衡失调，但他勉强应付了过来。

He passed the bookshelf at the other end of the room and entered the attached washroom. Shortly after, another protracted groan echoed off tiles, the toilet was flushed, the pipes ran with water and he returned, cup in hand.  
他经过房间另一端的书架，进入了相连的洗手间。不久后，一阵拖长的呻吟声在瓷砖间回荡，马桶被冲水，管道中传来水流声，他手握杯子返回。

She was fully awake at this point, taking him in as walked over beside the bed and set the cup on the table next to her.  
此时她已完全清醒，注视着他走近床边，将杯子放在她旁边的桌子上。

He looked down and for a moment she could do was stare back him, a dozen emotions and thoughts jockeying to get to forefront of her mind.  
他低头看去，一时间她只能回望着他，心中百感交集，思绪纷乱，争相涌上心头。

Then his remaining hand stirred, and she felt a light touch press gently against her scalp. She hesitated, but then leaned into it, allowing him to run his fingers through her hair. It was something she knew he enjoyed doing and something he knew she enjoyed, though she had never openly admitted it.  
随后，他仅存的那只手动了动，她感到头皮上传来轻柔的触感。她迟疑了一下，随即倾身靠近，任由他手指穿过她的发丝。这是她知道他喜欢做的事，也是他知道她喜欢的事，尽管她从未公开承认过。

"You can put your arm back on."  
“你可以把胳膊装回去。”

He glanced over his missing shoulder, then flicked to something behind her. His features briefly clouded before he finally turned back to her, shaking his head while his absently continued combing.  
他瞥了一眼自己缺失的肩膀，随即转向她身后的某处。他的表情短暂地阴沉下来，最终回过头来，一边摇头一边继续心不在焉地梳理。

"I'll leave it for now."  
“我暂时先放着吧。”

He leaned further down, kneeling on one leg and kissed her on her forehead. She felt a warmth spread out from her kiss and travel down to chest. The warmth was farm from the fiery wrath she was accustomed to, but it did the same work of putting some strength back into her overtaxed muscles.  
他更进一步弯下腰，单膝跪地，在她额头上轻轻一吻。她感到一股温暖从他的吻中扩散开来，蔓延至胸口。这温暖远非她习惯的炽热怒火，但它同样起到了恢复她过度疲惫肌肉力量的作用。

_I could get used to this.  
我渐渐习惯了这种感觉。_

"Kiss me again…I like it."  
"再吻我一次……我喜欢。"

He did so, and the warmth intensified, granting her more strength.  
他照做了，温暖愈发强烈，赋予她更多力量。

"Aga-" "阿加-"

Her request was interrupted by the sudden rumbling of her stomach. She cursed at the intrusion, but he completed the kiss with a smile.  
她的请求被突如其来的肚子咕噜声打断。她对这打扰咒骂了一句，但他却笑着完成了这个吻。

"I'm going to make breakfast, or maybe it's lunch now…" He said with a slight frown.  
"我去弄点早餐，或者现在已经是午餐了……" 他微微皱眉说道。

_No! You can__'t leave now!_  
不！你现在不能走！

She responded quickly, forcing her voice not to quiver.  
她迅速回应，努力让自己的声音不颤抖。

"Does it matter? You can't cook one handed, you idi…" she trailed off, catching herself, "…You can't cook with one hand, Shinji. You'll drop a knife on your foot or something."  
“这有关系吗？你一只手做不了饭，你这个……”她顿住了，及时收住话头，“……真嗣，你一只手做饭会切到自己的脚的。”

It was lackluster ploy, but she had to try.  
这招虽平淡无奇，但她不得不试。

"I managed to do it between surgeries and during physical therapy," He said with half a shrug, "What do you have in your fridge?"  
"我在手术间隙和物理治疗期间抽空做了这件事，" 他半耸肩说道，"你冰箱里有什么？"

"Bread, cheese, eggs and sausage…"  
"面包、奶酪、鸡蛋和香肠……"

"Buttered, toasted, then buttered again. Over easy, half a slice per egg. Sausage almost burnt to cinders," he said, reciting her preferences without pause, "Right?"  
"先涂黄油，再烤，接着再涂一次黄油。煎蛋要单面煎，每个蛋用半片吐司。香肠要煎到几乎焦黑，" 他不停顿地背诵着她的喜好，"对吧？"

She grunted affirmatively. Of course he knew how she liked her food cooked.  
她咕哝了一声表示肯定。他当然知道她喜欢食物怎么烹饪。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"I really did mean what I said last night," he whispered, hand moving to stroke her cheek, "I'm going to call in and say I'm sick or something, and we'll spend the day together. Sound good?"  
"我昨晚说的话是真心的，" 他低声说道，手移过去轻抚她的脸颊，"我会打电话请病假什么的，然后我们一整天都在一起。听起来不错吧？"

She nodded, unable to keep from smiling at the idea.  
她点点头，忍不住对这个想法露出微笑。

He straightened and stood, and for a moment she marveled at the sight. To her chagrin, he had long since surpassed her height by couple inches, but now he seemed to tower over her. When had he ever stood so tall? So confidently?  
他挺直身子站了起来，有那么一刻，她惊叹于眼前的景象。令她懊恼的是，他早已比她高出几英寸，但现在他似乎更加高大了。他何时曾如此挺拔？如此自信？

Then he looked at her, expectantly.  
然后他期待地看着她。

"I just need a moment," she said, "Don't worry."  
"我只需要一会儿时间，" 她说，"别担心。"

He nodded and strode out the room.  
他点点头，大步走出了房间。

With him gone, she able to take in the rest of her room.  
他一离开，她便能好好打量自己的房间了。

The space was largely spartan, as was the rest of the one story house, which she had made sure had at least twice the square footage as the old apartment in Tokyo-3. With all the extra space, even her vast collection of things had room to spread out, with any excess junk and knick-knacks shoved into various closets or having migrated over to Shinji's apartment.  
空间大体上显得简朴，正如这座单层房屋的其他部分一样，她确保其面积至少是东京-3 旧公寓的两倍。有了这些额外的空间，她庞大的收藏品得以舒展开来，多余的杂物和小玩意儿则被塞进了各个壁橱，或是转移到了真嗣的公寓里。

Next to her on the table was a cup of water (which she drank down greedily), which sat next to a pack of cigarettes, and her phone. Other that that, her bookshelf stood in the corner, filled with textbooks and some video games she had never found time to put back in the living room.  
桌旁紧挨着她的是一杯水（她贪婪地一饮而尽），旁边是一包香烟和她的手机。除此之外，书架立在角落，里面塞满了教科书和一些她一直没时间放回客厅的电子游戏。

Everything looked as it had been last night, but at the same time she could practically _feel_ how his very presence had somehow _altered_ the atmosphere of the place_._  
一切看起来都和昨晚一样，但同时她几乎能感觉到他的存在是如何改变了这个地方的氛围。

He had never stayed the night before, only insisting once before she had shot him down. Perhaps she had realized then that maybe this shift in ambiance was probably was the reason, or, more likely, she had simply been scared to wake up with a crushed windpipe.  
他以前从未留宿过，只在一次坚持后被她拒绝了。或许那时她已经意识到，这种氛围的变化可能是原因所在，或者更有可能，她只是害怕醒来时发现自己被压得喘不过气来。

Or maybe the sense of things having gone topsy-turvey was all in her head; the nauseating aftermath of the emotional roller coaster she'd ridden into exhaustion.  
又或许，一切变得混乱不堪的感觉只是她脑海中的错觉；这是她在情感过山车上耗尽精力后的恶心余波。

Regardless, Shinji was here now and she would need to figure out to do about it, and that required getting up and getting clean.  
无论如何，真嗣现在在这里，她需要想清楚如何应对，而这需要起床并洗个澡。

She dragged herself out of bed and into the bathroom, briefly eying her discarded eye-patch on the floor, and decided it could stay abandoned for now, right next to that accursed limb.  
她拖着身子从床上爬起，走进浴室，瞥了一眼地板上被丢弃的眼罩，决定暂时让它继续留在那儿，就躺在那该死的假肢旁边。

Her shower and thorough clean up felt absolutely divine, and by the end she had finally felt whole again, ready to tackle whatever the world could throw at her. She would've stayed under the blessed stream of hot water had not the smell cooking pervaded the steamy air, drawing her out of her heaven.  
淋浴和彻底的清洁让她感觉无比神圣，洗完后她终于觉得自己完整了，准备好迎接世界可能抛给她的一切。要不是烹饪的香味穿透了蒸汽弥漫的空气，将她从这片天堂中吸引出来，她真想一直待在那股热水的恩泽之下。

Revitalized, she reentered the room and had just put a cigarette in her mouth when she was immediately confronted with the first issue the world had decided to serve her up: four shallow grooves in the opposing wall, their edges crusted with dried blood.  
焕然一新的她回到房间，刚把一支烟叼在嘴里，就立刻面对了世界给她准备的第一道难题：对面墙上四道浅浅的划痕，边缘凝结着干涸的血迹。

_We really do have lot of shit to sort out, don__'t we?_  
我们确实有很多破事要处理，不是吗？

Not too long ago, when the police had dropped by to stop her raving, the idea would have been a paralyzing one, triggering another fight (never flight)response from her. But now it only pushed her heart into a mild gallop as she considered just how much of a priority restoring the paint was in comparison to untangling the rest of the tangled knot that was their relationship.  
不久前，当警察来制止她的咆哮时，这个念头本会让她陷入瘫痪，引发她新一轮的对抗（从不逃避）反应。但现在，它只是让她的心跳加速了一点，因为她考虑到了修复油漆与解开他们关系中其他纠结部分之间的优先级。

She had little time to ponder the issue when her phone suddenly rang, blaring some recent pop hit she had already forgotten about.  
当她的手机突然响起，播放着一首她已经忘记的最近流行歌曲时，她几乎没有时间去深思这个问题。

She flipped the device over and familiar number flashed across the screen. Asuka felt her eye roll out of reflex as she answered.  
她翻转设备，熟悉的号码在屏幕上闪烁。明日香不由自主地翻了个白眼，随即接听了电话。

"What do you want, Misato?"  
“你有什么事，美里？”

"Hey, Asuka, you free right now?"  
“嘿，明日香，你现在有空吗？”

She considered turning the woman down, then thought about how she had called from her personal number, not her work one.  
她考虑拒绝这个女人，但随即想到她是用私人号码而不是工作号码打来的。

"Yeah, I'm free." “嗯，我有空。”

"Good, can you put me on video?"  
“好的，你能让我视频通话吗？”

Asuka sighed and obliged.  
明日香叹了口气，顺从了。

A video feed of the Commander of Wille resting against a wall of pillows filled her screen. Considering the angle, it must have been placed up at the foot of the hospital bed or on a desk.  
屏幕上显示着威尔司令靠在一堆枕头墙上的视频。从角度来看，摄像头应该是放在病床脚端或桌子上。

Misato looked exhausted, her hair a frizzy violet mess and puffy dark rings underlining her eyes. At the same time however, she still projected her usual boisterous aura, and was beaming widely, the grin threatening to split her face in two.  
美里看起来疲惫不堪，头发凌乱地变成了紫罗兰色，眼下的黑眼圈又深又肿。然而，她依旧散发着往常的活力气息，笑容灿烂得仿佛要将脸庞一分为二。

In her arms was a small bundle, swaddling something that wriggled as it gurgled. Impossibly small hands reached out of cloth to try and clutch at purple strands, and the thing cooed as it managed to catch some.  
她怀里抱着一个小包裹，里面有什么东西在咯咯作响并蠕动着。那双小得不可思议的手从布料中伸出，试图抓住紫色的发丝，而那小东西在成功抓到一些后发出了咕咕的叫声。

To Asuka, the newborn (Misato had somehow procrastinated on giving it name, typical), while still technically _new_, wasn't some unknown factor since her phone had been bombarded with pictures of it for the past few days. Yet it still surprised her to see how lively it was in real life, wriggling and twisting as played with it's mother's hair.  
对明日香来说，这个新生儿（美里不知为何一直拖延着没给它取名，真是典型）虽然还算是个新手，但并不陌生，因为过去几天她的手机被这个小家伙的照片轰炸了。然而，亲眼见到它在现实中如此活泼，扭动着玩耍母亲的发丝，还是让她感到惊讶。

A sense of…fondness(?) started to well up inside her as her eyes transfixed on the child, almost prompting her lips into a small grin.  
一种……亲切感（？）开始在她心中涌起，她的目光紧盯着孩子，几乎让她的嘴角不由自主地露出了微笑。

Then her face and her mind froze to screeching halt as an icy spear of terror spiked upward from the void between her legs and gored through the fuzzy feeling.  
随后，她的脸庞和思绪骤然凝固，尖锐的恐惧如冰矛般从两腿间的虚空中直刺而上，穿透了那层朦胧的感觉。

She had downright _demanded_ Shinji not wear a condom last night, hadn't she? She had had a hormonal implant installed years ago to deal with menstrual cramps, but condoms had always been the final safeguard, a physical barrier against throwing away her career as a pilot, against motherh-  
她昨晚确实坚决要求真嗣不要戴避孕套，不是吗？多年前她为了缓解月经痛安装了激素植入物，但避孕套一直是最后的防线，一道物理屏障，防止她放弃作为驾驶员的职业，防止母亲——

_She was in a hospital bed, staring blankly at bundle in her lap. The cloth folded back to reveal a doll with blue buttons for eyes and thick red hair-  
她躺在医院的病床上，茫然地凝视着腿上的襁褓。布料被掀开，露出一个有着蓝色纽扣眼睛和浓密红头发的娃娃——_

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

_-He was was there, standing above her, smiling proudly. He reached for the bundle, but she gripped it to her chest as he leaned forward-  
-他就在那里，站在她上方，自豪地微笑着。他伸手去拿那包裹，但她紧紧抱在胸前，当他俯身向前时——_

"Asuka? Hellooo? Are you okay?"  
"明日香？喂？你还好吗？"

_-the doll moved, cheeks suddenly flushed with color as it babbled with glee at simply being alive, wrinkled hands wrapping around false fingers that-  
-玩偶动了，脸颊突然染上了颜色，因为它仅仅因为活着而高兴得喋喋不休，皱巴巴的手环绕着假手指——_

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

A familiar voice bellowed her name, loud enough to make the vision shudder until it tore apart and left her swaying in place.  
一个熟悉的声音大声呼喊着她的名字，响亮到让幻象颤抖直至撕裂，留下她摇摇欲坠。

She shunted the tatters of the delusion aside and focused on her phone.  
她将幻觉的碎片推到一旁，专注于手机。

"Huh? What? I-I'm fine." “嗯？什么？我——我没事。”

Misato's haggard face stayed set in concern, blatantly unconvinced.  
美里憔悴的脸上满是关切，明显不相信。

"You sure?" "你确定吗？"

Asuka realized with a start that her jaw muscles ached something fierce and she was slightly out of breath. She must have been either grimacing or grinding her teeth while the woman had been trying to get her attention. Likely both.  
明日香突然意识到自己的下巴肌肉酸痛得厉害，而且还有点喘不过气来。她肯定是在那个女人试图引起她注意时一直在皱眉或咬牙切齿。很可能两者都有。

"Yeah. Why? Because I yelled at that new tech for touching my Eva? It's not my fault you hire weirdos." She shot back sharply.  
“是啊。为什么？因为我对那个新来的技术员吼了一声，因为他碰了我的 Eva？你们雇佣怪人可不是我的错。”她尖锐地反驳道。

_And for talking to Shinji, damn near throwing her tits in his face!  
还跟真嗣说话，简直像要把胸部甩到他脸上似的！_

The woman fell silent, looking uncomfortable. The infant seemed to pick up on the disquiet and stopped playing with her hair, starting to writhe.  
女人沉默下来，显得有些不自在。婴儿似乎感受到了这种不安，停止了玩弄她的头发，开始扭动起来。

"…We received a noise complaint from your neighbors," the Commander said carefully, "…Are the two of you back together?"  
“…我们收到了你邻居的噪音投诉，”指挥官谨慎地说，“…你们俩又复合了吗？”

She scowled, but felt none of the annoyance she normally would've felt at what was left unsaid, and instead felt the unpleasant sting of embarrassment.  
她皱了皱眉，但并未感到通常会有的恼怒，反而是一种不愉快的尴尬刺痛了她。

_Did you hurt each other again? Do I need sit down with the chief of police? Please, Asuka, just let me enjoy my time off for once.  
你们又互相伤害了吗？我需要去找警察局长谈谈吗？拜托，明日香，就让我享受一次我的假期吧。_

"There's nothing to worry about, Misato," Asuka huffed, turning up her nose, "You have an infant to baby, don't waste it on me."  
“没什么好担心的，美里，”明日香哼了一声，昂起头，“你有个婴儿要照顾，别在我身上浪费时间。”

Misato started to say something, but stopped. Then her face split into that infuriatingly know-it-all grin only she could pull off.  
美里刚要开口，却又停住了。随即，她的脸上绽开了那种只有她才能驾驭的、令人恼火的无所不知的笑容。

"Hey, Asuka?" “嘿，明日香？”

"What" “什么？”

"You seem to be in a good mood. Something good happen?" She winked and her voice dipped into a conspiratorial whisper, "If it's not Shinji, then is it someone else? C'mon you can tell Mama Misato."  
"你看起来心情不错。有什么好事发生吗？" 她眨了眨眼，声音低沉下来，带着一种密谋的口吻，"如果不是真嗣，那会是谁呢？来吧，你可以告诉 Misato 妈妈。"

"N-No!" She squawked back, "I'm not some skank!"  
"不-不是！" 她急忙反驳，"我不是那种随便的人！"

"Oh? So it's Shinji then?  
"哦？那就是真嗣了？"

"Shut up!" "闭嘴！"

Asuka felt her face heat up and the sting intensify as the woman chuckled and gently rocked her baby.  
明日香感到自己的脸颊发热，刺痛感愈发强烈，而那位女士轻声笑着，温柔地摇晃着怀中的婴儿。

"By the way, what are you wearing?"  
“顺便问一下，你穿的是什么？”

The redhead looked down and realized the shirt she was wearing wasn't one of hers. The fabric hung too loosely off her frame and the hem reached her halfway to her knees. Thankfully, the collar wasn't low enough to reveal anything other than pale skin and the edge of an indent.  
红发女孩低头一看，意识到身上穿的衬衫并非自己的。布料在她身上显得过于宽松，下摆几乎垂至膝盖。幸好，领口并不低，除了苍白的肌肤和一道浅浅的印痕外，并未暴露更多。

_Dressed in a shirt too big for me, cigarette dangling out my mouth, hair a mess; no wonder Misato asked. She probably thinks I just got my brains fucked out.  
穿着一件对我来说过大的衬衫，嘴里叼着烟，头发凌乱；难怪美里会问。她大概以为我刚被搞得神魂颠倒。_

…Which she quietly determined wasn't far off from the truth. Actually, that _was_ the truth,, wasn't it?  
……她悄悄地判断这离真相不远。实际上，那就是真相，不是吗？

_Yup, Shinji fucked my brains out, then said he loved me and_ swore _he__'d never let me go. Now he's half naked in my kitchen cooking up a storm._  
没错，真嗣把我搞得神魂颠倒，然后说他爱我，发誓永远不会让我离开。现在他半裸着在我厨房里大显身手。

Asuka stifled the sudden urge to cackle madly.  
明日香强忍住突然想疯狂大笑的冲动。

Shinji loved her. The idiot honestly and truly did, didn't he? They could deal with all their other bullshit later because _he loved her._  
真嗣爱她。这个傻瓜真的、确实爱她，不是吗？他们可以稍后再处理其他那些乱七八糟的事，因为他爱她。

"It's just a shirt I bought online but never returned" she answered, realizing that she'd been silent for too long, "Can't have too many comfy shirts, right?"  
“这只是我在网上买的一件衬衫，但一直没退货，”她回答道，意识到自己沉默太久了，“舒适的衬衫总是不嫌多，对吧？”

"Uh-huh, sure." "嗯哼，当然。"

Asuka scowled again at the woman's smug tone, but she stopped as the sound of humming drifted into the room from the kitchen over the smell of cooking meat.  
明日香再次对那女人得意的语气皱眉，但当厨房传来哼唱声，伴随着烹饪肉类的香味飘入房间时，她停了下来。

Misato leaned forward slightly, looking around as if she were on the edge of a window and not behind a screen, miles away.  
美里微微前倾，环顾四周，仿佛她正站在窗边而非屏幕后，相隔千里。

"What was that?" "那是什么？"

"I left the TV on some cooking show," Asuka said quickly, "that's all."  
"我把电视调到了某个烹饪节目，" 明日香迅速说道，"就这样。"

"Uh-"

The smarmy affirmative was cut off as the baby started to grumble.  
那自以为是的肯定话语被婴儿的咕哝声打断了。

"Shh, shh, don't cry little one. Here, daddy will take care of you."  
"嘘，嘘，别哭，小宝贝。来，爸爸会照顾你的。"

Mr. Hyuga, or rather, Mr. Katsuragi, briefly entered the view, waved with a smile and whisked away the infant after kissing his wife on the cheek. In those brief seconds of seeing the three of them together, Asuka had to begrudgingly admit they looked almost picturesque.  
碇先生，或者说，葛城先生，短暂地出现在视野中，微笑着挥了挥手，亲吻了妻子的脸颊后便抱走了婴儿。在那短短几秒看到他们三人在一起的瞬间，明日香不得不勉强承认，他们看起来几乎如画般美好。

Misato looked longingly off screen, then turned back to the front, transfixing Asuka with a darkening expression.  
美里深情地望向屏幕外，然后转回前方，用愈发阴沉的表情凝视着明日香。

Before she could speak up however, a distant cry sounded from down the hallway.  
然而，在她能开口之前，走廊尽头传来了遥远的哭声。

Asuka jumped to her feet and rushed down the corridor, crossing the four meters between her room and the kitchen in what seemed like heartbeat.  
明日香一跃而起，冲向走廊，仿佛心跳间便跨越了她房间与厨房之间那四米的距离。

She found him in front of the stove piled with steaming dishes, wiping a rag against his stomach. Shinji had found his pair of shorts, but the rest of him skin was still bare…a look she idly noted suited him quite nicely.  
她在冒着热气的锅前找到了他，他正用抹布擦拭着肚子。真嗣找到了他的短裤，但身体的其他部分依旧裸露着……她不经意间注意到，这模样倒是很适合他。

"_What did you do_?" “你做了什么？”

He cringed at the sharpness in her voice, and she winced at the response.  
他对她声音中的尖锐感到畏缩，而她对这反应也皱起了眉头。

Then he looked at her face, and he slowly relaxed. He put the rag down and rubbed the back of his head in that age-old way she always found frustratingly endearing.  
然后他看着她的脸，慢慢地放松下来。他放下抹布，用那种她总觉得既恼人又可爱的古老方式揉了揉后脑勺。

"I forgot the first rule of cooking: never cook naked without a shirt on."  
“我忘了烹饪的第一条规则：永远不要光着上身裸体做饭。”

Asuka palmed her forehead and let loose a sigh.  
明日香用手掌拍了拍额头，长叹了一口气。

"I told you last night, Shinji. Your body is mine, don't go around hurting yourself doing stupid things."  
“昨晚我就告诉过你了，真嗣。你的身体是我的，别再做那些蠢事伤害自己。”

He smiled broadly and she her face heat up.  
他笑得十分灿烂，她的脸颊不禁发热。

"Alright," he said with a smile, "Anyway, the food's alm-"  
"好吧，" 他微笑着说，"反正，食物已经差不多-"

He stopped as his shorts started to shriek in alarm.  
他的短裤突然发出警报声，他停了下来。

He glanced at her, then his hand immediately dug into his pocket and drew out a similar phone to hers.  
他瞥了她一眼，随即立刻伸手从口袋里掏出一部与她相似的手机。

"Hello? What's the emergency?"  
“喂？出什么事了？”

He cocked his head, looking bewildered and she could only respond with her own look of confusion.  
他歪着头，显得一头雾水，她只能回以同样困惑的表情。

_Wait, Misato didn__'t mention an attack, so…_  
等等，美里没提到有袭击，所以……

"Just a test? I'm okay…no really, I'm okay, and Asuka's okay too…wait wait how do you know what happened to my arm?"  
"只是个测试？我没事…真的，我没事，明日香也还好…等等，你怎么知道我手臂的事？"

He suddenly looked down, and Asuka followed his gaze to where she still gripped her phone.  
他突然低头，明日香顺着他的目光看向自己仍紧握手机的手。

The video feed cut off, but not before Asuka caught a glimpse of Misato clutching her own phone to the side her face, expression unreadable.  
视频信号中断，但在那之前，明日香瞥见了美里将手机紧贴在脸侧，表情难以捉摸。

"Listen, Misato, I'm fine. I just needed a break from wearing it, alright?," he said, frustration creeping into his voice, "No, she didn't attack me, and no, she's not making me say that."  
“听着，美里，我没事。我只是需要脱下来透透气，好吗？”他的声音中透出一丝不耐烦，“不，她没有攻击我，也没有逼我说这话。”

He paused, placing the phone in the crook of his neck so he palm his forehead. Meanwhile, she internally growled, resisting the urge to grab snatch the piece of plastic away and yell into it.  
他停顿了一下，将手机夹在脖子和肩膀之间，用手掌揉了揉额头。与此同时，她内心怒火中烧，强忍着夺过那块塑料片并对着它大喊的冲动。

_How dare she assume that I hurt him! That I__'m holding him hostage!_  
她怎么敢认为我伤害了他！认为我挟持了他！

"Why am I at Asuka's?"  
“我为什么会在明日香这里？”

Asuka felt her fists clench as she anxiously awaited his answer. Was he going to lie to Misato? Hide the fact he loved her because it was embarrassing to fall for Willie's resident "Red Demon"? Was he going to run away again?  
明日香感到自己的拳头紧握，焦急地等待着他的回答。他会不会对美里撒谎？会不会因为爱上 Willie 里的“红魔女”而感到尴尬，从而隐瞒自己对她的爱意？他会不会再次逃避？

"Well…we talked things over and figured some things out…big things…I don't know, Misato, couple's therapy seems too soo-no, no, you're right, everyone saw how it worked out for you two…"  
“嗯……我们谈了谈，理清了一些事情……很大的事情……我不知道，美里，情侣咨询似乎太早了——不，不，你说得对，大家都看到了你们俩的结果……”

He paused again, then inched closer to wrap his arm around her waist.  
他再次停顿，然后缓缓靠近，用胳膊环住了她的腰。

"Listen Misato, what I do know that is I love her, and that's all I think really matters right now."  
“听着，美里，我知道的是我爱她，我认为现在这最重要。”

The confidence behind his words struck her as much as the firm grip that held her.  
他话语中的坚定自信，以及那紧握她的力道，都深深触动了她。

A third surge of warmth spread through her body, spurring her to use it, and this time Asuka did give into her urges.  
又一股暖流在她体内涌动，催促她去利用它，这一次，明日香确实屈服于自己的冲动。

She reached up, yanked the phone down to ear level, and roared.  
她伸手一拽，将电话拉到耳边，咆哮道。

"That's right, Misato! He loves me and I love him! And we're going to figure things out, with or without some nitwit with a useless degree! If you don't like it then you and those busybodies across the street can kiss our asses!"  
“没错，美里！他爱我，我也爱他！不管有没有那个拿着无用学位的小丑，我们都会把事情解决！如果你不喜欢，那你和那些街对面的多管闲事的家伙们，都可以亲我们的屁股！”

Everything fell silent, except for the quiet click of the stove's clock, stoically informing that indeed, it was still breakfast time, though barely.  
一切陷入寂静，除了炉子上时钟轻微的滴答声，坚定地提醒着，确实，早餐时间仍在继续，尽管已接近尾声。

Asuka waited the silence out, breathing heavily as she glared down at a screen that showed a still image of their past guardian posing as some nameless U.N official clipped a medal to her chest.  
明日香等待着沉默过去，沉重地呼吸着，目光锐利地盯着屏幕上显示的静止画面，画面中他们过去的监护人装扮成一位无名联合国官员，正将一枚勋章别在她的胸前。

Then a loud squeal erupted from the phone and pierced the air, forcing her to shove it away from her face. The squeal died down, but a stream of loud chatter flowed forth to replace it.  
随后，手机突然发出一声尖锐的鸣叫，刺穿了空气，迫使她将它从脸旁推开。尖叫声渐渐减弱，但随即被一连串喧闹的对话声所取代。

"I knew it! Knew it, knew it, knew it! I'm so happy for you two! So you two are sleeping together, huh? Well make sure to use-"  
"我就知道！知道，知道，知道！我真为你们俩高兴！所以你们俩现在睡在一起了，是吧？那可得记得用——"

Shinji sputtered as he took back the phone and tried to talk the excited woman down, failing spectacularly as the she made even more racy comments.  
真嗣急忙抢回电话，试图让兴奋的女人冷静下来，却惨败收场，她甚至说了更多露骨的话。

Asuka stared, then found herself laughing as the man who would literally rip his own arm to quell her fears reverted back to the awkward boy who stuttered over being teased.  
明日香瞪大了眼睛，随即发现自己笑了起来，那个为了安抚她的恐惧不惜撕裂自己手臂的男人，此刻又变回了那个在被调侃时结结巴巴的笨拙男孩。

She wiped a tear from her eye, not bothering to hide it. Besides, it was a happy tear after all, a rarity bordering on anomaly.  
她擦去眼角的泪珠，并未试图掩饰。毕竟，这终究是喜悦的泪水，一种近乎异常的稀罕。

Then it hit her. 然后，她恍然大悟。

This atmosphere, this laughter, this lost sense of joy that came back so easily to her now: they were things she hadn't experienced since she'd barely older than toddler, in that short span of time when piloting had to define her entirely.  
这种氛围，这阵欢笑，这份轻易回归的失落已久的快乐：自她还是个蹒跚学步的孩子以来，在那个短暂时期，驾驶成了她全部的定义，她便再未体验过这些。

It was then she had accepted the atmosphere surrounding her had indeed changed. Her house, it seemed, was finally starting to feel like a home.  
就在那时，她意识到周围的氛围确实发生了变化。她的房子，似乎终于开始有了家的感觉。

A/N

Hello there, 你好呀，

As with most things, my return to writing fan-fiction after well of a decade away from any serious creative writing did not go as planned.  
和大多数事情一样，我时隔十多年重新回到同人创作的道路，并没有按照预想的那样顺利。

I had hoped to start small, dipping my toe into the water and seeing if I remembered how to swim, or if anything bit me for my intrusion. I can't actually swim in real life, so I guess that comparison doesn't quite work…yet it still feels apt.  
我本想从小处着手，试探性地踏入这片水域，看看自己是否还记得如何游泳，或是是否会因我的闯入而遭到什么东西的咬噬。实际上我在现实生活中并不会游泳，所以这个比喻可能不太贴切……但感觉依然恰如其分。

Anyway, to give insight into how this story ballooned from a planned cap of 4,000 to more than triple that number, I must first admit I fell into the trap of self-indulgence when finished the original draft, and kept adding to it as I found excuse after excuse to clarify and justify a history left unwritten. The result is what you've just read, as long-winded as the previous sentence.  
无论如何，为了揭示这个故事如何从原计划的 4,000 字上限膨胀到如今的三倍之多，我必须首先承认，在完成初稿后，我陷入了自我放纵的陷阱，不断找借口来澄清和证明那些未曾书写的过往，从而不断添加内容。结果就是你们刚刚读到的，冗长如前文所述。

Originally, this supposed to be a much shorter, much darker tale, more akin to the one Shinji tells the officer: a brutal and twisted thing that may have been one of "what-ifs" shown during Instrumentality. I figured that even with Third Impact averted, the rocky relationship between Asuka and Shinji wouldn't progress without it's own host of issues, especially since the two would be denied the revelations Third Impact had forced upon the two (and perhaps everyone else).  
原本，这应该是一篇更短小、更阴暗的故事，更接近真嗣对警官讲述的那一则：一个残酷而扭曲的故事，可能是“如果”系列中的一环，在人类补完计划中展现。我设想，即便避免了第三次冲击，真嗣和明日香之间坎坷的关系也不会在没有自身问题的情况下顺利发展，尤其是因为两人被剥夺了第三次冲击所强加给他们的（或许还有其他人的）启示。

Asuka has always been a character to express herself physically, from her introduction slapping the boys on the _Over the Rainbow_, to her ill fated final battle. In terms of the violence on Shinji's part, he has always had a problem recognizing the struggles those around him unless pushed to physical and metal extremes, which results in him lashing out, usually in disappointment and/or frustration. Having these two children, now adults in this story, try and cling to each other would obviously not bode well for either.  
明日香一直是个通过肢体动作表达自我的角色，从她在彩虹之上对男孩们的耳光，到她不幸的最终战役。至于真嗣的暴力行为，他总是难以理解周围人的挣扎，除非被逼到身心极限，这导致他通常在失望和/或沮丧中爆发。让这两个孩子，现在故事中的成年人，试图相互依偎，显然对双方都不利。

But, in the end I wanted a redemptive story, closer in tone to how the series ended, rather than the movie. I feel the result is similarly cheesy, but earnest, just like having the cast stand up to congratulate Shinji on his success realizing he's a person.  
但最终，我想要一个救赎的故事，更接近系列结局的基调，而不是电影。我觉得结果同样俗气，但真诚，就像让全体角色站起来祝贺真嗣意识到自己是一个人一样。

Despite the "happy" ending however, I also wanted to make sure that things weren't suddenly fixed but their dual confessions. You can't simply overlook repeated cycles of denial, substance abuse and escapism—and you _especially_ can't overlook a history of abusive codependency. Then of course, there's also the matter of having at least two war machines capable of destroying any conventional military to consider. Gods in all but name, just sitting there, waiting to be used…  
尽管结局标榜着“幸福”，但我同样希望确保问题并未因他们的双重坦白而突然解决。我们不能简单忽视一再出现的否认、物质滥用和逃避现实的循环——更不能忽视一段充满虐待的共依存关系的历史。当然，还有至少两台能够摧毁任何常规军事力量的战争机器需要考虑。这些近乎神明的存在，就那样静静地坐着，等待被启用……

If you've made it this far, dear reader, I hope I entertained you enough to give me some sign you actually engaged with what I've put forth, for better or worse. A follow, a fav, or simple review along the lines of "It didn't suck" would do wonders for my motivation. That said, everyone knows beggars can't be choosers.  
亲爱的读者，如果你已经读到这里，希望我的作品能让你感到足够有趣，给我一些反馈，无论是好是坏。一个关注、一个收藏，或是一条简单的评论如“还不错”，都会极大地激励我。话虽如此，大家都知道，乞求者无权挑剔。
