**January 11****th** **2021**  2021 年 1 月 11 日

**Tokyo 3 Outskirts - Early Morning  
第三新东京市郊外 - 清晨**

There is a bright flash of light and I suddenly become aware of my surroundings. I'm underwater, swimming in a dark red liquid. I feel panic within me as I hold my breath and swim towards the surface as quick as I can. My limbs feel as if they're on fire as I finally reach the surface of the water and gasp for air.  
一道耀眼的光芒闪过，我突然意识到自己身处的环境。我在水下，游动在一片暗红色的液体中。我感到一阵恐慌，屏住呼吸，尽可能快地向水面游去。我的四肢仿佛在燃烧，当我终于到达水面时，我大口喘息着。

I float on the surface for a few moments taking in my surroundings. Off in the distance I see the land, without hesitating I start to swim towards it as fast as my aching body will take me. As I move a sickening smell infiltrates my nostrils, my mind registers what this foul copper-like smell is.  
我在水面上漂浮了一会儿，观察四周。远处我看到了陆地，毫不犹豫地开始向它游去，尽我疼痛的身体所能达到的最快速度。随着我的移动，一股令人作呕的气味侵入我的鼻孔，我的脑海中浮现出这股恶臭的铜质气味的来源。

Blood... Am I swimming in blood? I try not to think about it. Survival and getting out of this liquid is the priority. I move forward and my mind informs me that swimming has never been one of my strengths. It was something I was capable of but never enjoyed or excelled at. Fortunately, that doesn't seem to matter as I reach the land.  
血...我是在血中游泳吗？我尽量不去想这件事。生存和逃离这片液体是首要任务。我继续前进，我的意识告诉我，游泳从来不是我的强项。虽然我能做到，但从未喜欢过或擅长过。幸运的是，这似乎并不重要，因为我最终到达了陆地。

I'm thankful for the sensation of the soft sand beneath my naked feet as I take a few slow and careful steps out of the water. Every part of my body hurts and I again find myself thankful for the sand being there to cushion me as I fall forward. Some of it flies up into my face and mouth, I try to spit it out before rolling onto my back and simply lying there for a few moments to catch my breath.  
我感激地感受着赤脚踏在柔软沙地上的触感，缓缓而小心翼翼地走出水面。全身每一处都在疼痛，再次庆幸有沙子作为缓冲，当我向前跌倒时。一些沙粒飞溅到我的脸上和嘴里，我试图吐出它们，然后翻过身来，只是躺在那里片刻，喘口气。

I can now feel the water lapping at my bare feet and the hems of my trousers. I can still smell the blood-like smell of the liquid and in my weakened state I prop myself up onto my elbows and try to shift away from the liquid. Above me the sky is a brilliant blue, the sun shining down on me and there is a gentle but cool breeze in the air.  
现在我能感觉到水轻拍着我赤裸的双脚和裤脚。我仍能闻到那液体类似血的气味，在我虚弱的状态下，我用手肘撑起自己，试图远离那液体。头顶上的天空是明亮的蓝色，阳光照耀着我，空气中有一股轻柔而凉爽的微风。

I look down at myself. I'm barefoot and wearing a pair of black trousers, this is accompanied by a white button-up shirt that is currently open revealing a tattered orange t-shirt. I look up from myself to the rest of my surroundings. Ahead of me I see the pool I emerged from, it's an incredibly large body of water coloured a deep blood red. The smell of it makes me feel sick but I can see that it is not blood as I feared.  
我低头看着自己。我赤着脚，穿着一条黑色裤子，搭配着一件敞开的白色扣衫，露出了破烂的橙色 T 恤。我从自己身上抬起目光，环顾四周。在我前方，我看到了我刚从那里出来的水池，它是一个巨大无比的水体，呈现出深血红色。它的气味让我感到恶心，但我能看出那并不是我担心的血液。

I look around and some additional monuments catch my eye. I feel rising out of the water a number of large strange statues. They're posed in cross like forms, their arms stretching out wide. I shudder at the sight of them. There is something eerily familiar about them, something familiar and terrifying. I dislike this feeling and turn my head away not wishing to see them any longer.  
我环顾四周，一些额外的纪念碑吸引了我的目光。我感觉到从水中升起了许多巨大而奇异的雕像。它们以十字形姿态排列，双臂向外伸展。看到它们，我不禁打了个寒颤。这些雕像有种诡异的熟悉感，既熟悉又可怕。我不喜欢这种感觉，于是转过头去，不再想看到它们。

'Where am I?' I ask myself as I take another look around, trying to avoid looking at the statues. As I look around I see other things that catch my eye and seem so familiar to me. I see the remains of buildings sticking up out of the water and I wonder exactly what happened here. What cause all of this to happen and why am I here now?  
'我在哪里？' 我自问，再次环顾四周，试图避开那些雕像。当我四处张望时，我看到了其他吸引我眼球的东西，它们对我来说似乎非常熟悉。我看到水面上矗立着的建筑残骸，不禁好奇这里究竟发生了什么。是什么导致了这一切的发生，而我此刻又为何会在这里？

I try to cast my mind back to what happened before I emerged from that pool. I try to remember what happened to me before that bright flash of light. It's at this moment I feel my stomach drop and little pangs of panic rise up inside me.  
我试图回想起从那个水池中出现之前发生的事情。我努力回忆在那道耀眼的光芒之前我经历了什么。就在这时，我感到胃部一阵下沉，内心涌起了些许恐慌的刺痛。

I... I can't remember. I can't... remember anything before that flash of light. I don't know what happened before it, I don't know... I don't know who I am!  
我...我记不起来了。在那道闪光之前的一切...我都...想不起来。我不知道闪光之前发生了什么，我不知道...我不知道自己是谁！

"Who am I?" “我是谁？”

I speak the words aloud hoping that maybe hearing the sound of my own voice might trigger something inside of me.  
我大声说出这些话，希望也许听到自己的声音能在我内心触发些什么。

It doesn't. Instead I feel more pangs of panic inside my stomach and I feel sicker than before. I don't know who I am! I don't know my name, where I came from, why I'm here or anything. No matter how much I try to remember, I'm just drawing a blank.  
它没有。相反，我感到胃里一阵阵恐慌的刺痛，比之前更加恶心。我不知道自己是谁！我不知道我的名字，我从哪里来，为什么在这里，或者任何事情。无论我怎么努力回忆，脑子里只是一片空白。

I get myself onto my knees and crawl forward towards the water. Pain shoots through my body with each movement but I try to shrug it off. I can't stop... I... I have to know.  
我让自己跪起来，向前爬向水边。每一次移动都让身体疼痛不已，但我试图忽视它。我不能停下来...我...我必须要知道。

"Who... Who Am I?" “我...我是谁？”

I say the words again as I get closer to the water. I look down at it hoping to see some sort of reflection. Some sort of clue as to who I am but the water is too dark to reflect anything for me to see.  
我再次说出这些话，当我走近水边。我低头望向水面，希望能看到某种倒影。希望能找到关于我是谁的线索，但水太黑了，什么也映不出来。

"Who am I!" “我是谁！”

I ask again as I bring my hand down into the water in frustration. I feel the droplets splash up onto my face.  
我再次问道，同时沮丧地将手伸入水中。我感觉到水滴溅到脸上。

"Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?"  
"我是谁？我是谁？我是谁？"

I keep asking and with each time I ask I bring a hand down into the water. I'm vaguely aware of a sound from behind me but I don't care to turn around and see what it is. All that matters to me is trying to find an answer to who I am. I dislike this. I hate this. I'm terrified of this. I need to know. I need to know!  
我不断追问，每一次提问，我都将手浸入水中。我隐约听到身后有声响，但我无意转身去看。对我来说，最重要的是试图找到我是谁的答案。我不喜欢这样。我讨厌这样。我对此感到恐惧。我需要知道。我需要知道！

"Who! Am! I!" "谁！是！我！"

I ask again as both hands come down, more water splashed up onto me as I hear another sound. It sounds like something slamming and moments later it's accompanied by the sound of footsteps. I don't turn around, I find myself frozen with fear as I wait for them to approach. The sound stops and I hear a voice, that of a young woman.  
我再次问道，双手落下时，更多的水溅到了我身上，同时我听到了另一种声音。那声音像是有什么东西猛地撞击，片刻后伴随着脚步声。我没有转身，发现自己因恐惧而僵住，等待着他们靠近。声音停止了，我听到了一个年轻女子的声音。

"Go and contact headquarters, tell them they were right and we have another survivor. Get them to prepare one of the rooms. I'll deal with this."  
“去联系总部，告诉他们我们猜对了，还有另一个幸存者。让他们准备一个房间。我来处理这里。”

I still don't turn around but I'm fairly sure one of the others has turned and went away. I remain still as I hear the woman start to walk towards me. She stops a metre or two away from me and I slowly turn myself around.  
我依然没有转身，但我相当确定其中一人已经转身离开。我保持静止，听着那女子开始向我走来。她在离我一两米远的地方停下，我慢慢地转过身来。

She is looking at me somewhat cautiously, perhaps the way someone might approach an animal they were unsure of. She kneels slowly and I take the time to look at her properly. She is a young woman with long brown hair done up in a ponytail. She is wearing a uniform that I don't recognize. Her expression seems warm and friendly but also cautious.  
她正有些谨慎地看着我，或许就像人们接近一只不确定的动物时的那种方式。她慢慢地跪下，我趁机仔细打量她。她是一位年轻女子，长长的棕色头发扎成马尾。她穿着一套我不认识的制服。她的表情显得温暖而友好，但也带着谨慎。

"Don't be afraid. We're here to help you." She finally says in a warm tone.  
“别害怕。我们是来帮你的。”她终于用温暖的语气说道。

"Who... Who am I?" I ask weakly, "I... I don't... I don't remember... anything."  
“我...我是谁？”我虚弱地问道，“我...我不...我不记得...任何事情。”

She takes a few steps forward and kneels down in front of me. She places a warm hand on my shoulder and rubs gently, "It'll be alright, it's a side effect of the emergence. In time you'll be fine, we're going to take you back to a safe place. Is that alright?"  
她向前走了几步，跪在我面前。她将温暖的手放在我的肩上，轻轻揉搓，“一切都会好起来的，这是觉醒的副作用。过段时间你就会没事的，我们会带你去一个安全的地方。这样可以吗？”

I nod weakly at her. I don't know what she means by emergence but I feel like I can trust her.  
我虚弱地点了点头。我不知道她所说的觉醒是什么意思，但我感觉可以信任她。

"Good. Can you stand?" “很好。你能站起来吗？”

I nod again, "I-I think so."  
我再次点头，“我——我想是的。”

She gets to her feet and extends a hand towards me. I reach out and take it and she helps me to my feet. My body still aches and I stumble forward slightly but she is there to catch me. She puts my arm around her shoulders and helps guide me towards a waiting vehicle and her colleague. I remain silent as I'm helped into the back of the vehicle as she takes a radio from him.  
她站起身来，向我伸出手。我伸出手握住，她扶我站起来。我的身体依然疼痛，微微踉跄了一下，但她及时扶住了我。她把我的手臂搭在她的肩膀上，引导我走向一辆等待的车辆和她的一位同事。我默默地被扶进车后座，她则从他那里接过一个无线电。

"Team 2-A reporting in, I have one survivor. Male, late teens and showing some signs of emergence sickness. Will need a doctor on standby for when we return."  
“2-A 小队报告，我这里有一名幸存者。男性，十几岁，表现出一些觉醒病症的迹象。返回时需要医生待命。”

I hear the voice on the other side come through clearly, _"A survivor? Been quite a while since the last one. We've got a room ready as we speak and I'll let the medical team know to be on standby. Anything else to report?"_  
我清晰地听到电话那头传来的声音，“幸存者？距离上一个已经很久了。我们这边已经准备好了房间，我会通知医疗团队随时待命。还有什么要报告的吗？”

"Nothing, it's all quiet out here. Will see you shortly."  
“没有，这里一切都很安静。我们很快见。”

The two of them climb into the vehicle properly and close the door. I look around and bring the belt around me and clip it in. It's strange that I can't remember who I am but I know to do this. As the car moves away I begin to wonder who these people are and what this emergence sickness was they mentioned.  
他们两人正式上了车并关上门。我环顾四周，拉过安全带扣好。奇怪的是，我不记得自己是谁，但我知道该这么做。随着车子驶离，我开始思考这些人是谁，以及他们提到的这种突发疾病是什么。

After a minute or so the man in the car turns himself around, he is about the same age as the girl.  
大约一分钟后，车里的男人转过身来，他和女孩年纪相仿。

"Our facility is only about ten minutes away from here." He tells me, "You know, you're the first person we've seen emerge in quite some time. We thought that all who were going to return had already returned by now."  
“我们的设施离这儿只有大约十分钟的路程。”他告诉我，“你知道吗，你是我们很久以来见到的第一个出现的人。我们以为所有要回来的人都已经回来了。”

I look at him in confusion not really knowing what he is talking about. All I can do is nod my head and immediately he seems to recognize my confusion.  
我困惑地看着他，不太明白他在说什么。我只能点点头，他似乎立刻察觉到了我的困惑。

"Sorry, I guess you probably don't have a clue what I'm talking about do you?"  
"抱歉，我猜你可能完全不知道我在说什么，对吧？"

I shake my head, "I am sorry."  
我摇摇头，"我很抱歉。"

"No need to apologize." He says to me, "it's the emergence sickness. It affects most of us when we come out. Tend to draw a complete blank as to who we are and what happened before. It'll pass tough, it always does!"  
"无需道歉。" 他对我說，"这是出现症状。我们大多数人出来时都会受到影响。往往会完全忘记自己是谁以及之前发生了什么。不过它会过去的，总是如此！"

I feel somewhat reassured by his words but that little feeling of dread is still hanging there. I resist the urge to ask questions like, 'what if it doesn't?'  
他的话让我稍感安心，但那股隐隐的恐惧感依旧挥之不去。我强忍着不去问那些问题，比如，'如果它不呢？'

"So is there anything you do remember?"  
“那你记得些什么吗？”

"No... nothing." I tell him.  
“不……什么也不记得。”我告诉他。

"Well try to not worry about it!" He reassures me again, "Few days rest and everything will work out fine."  
“尽量别担心！”他又安慰我，“休息几天，一切都会好起来的。”

**UN Emergence Support Facility – Late Evening  
联合国紧急支援设施 – 深夜**

I look into the bathroom mirror and once again try to recall just who it is I am. I can feel the frustration beginning to set in for me. It's been this way for three quarters of an hour and I've come no closer to remembering who I am than I was this morning.  
我望向浴室镜子，再次试图回忆我是谁。我能感觉到挫败感开始涌上心头。这种情况已经持续了四十五分钟，而我对自己身份的记忆并不比今早更清晰。

I know that they said this would only be temporary but I want to know, I need to know. I don't want to just sit there and wait. I want to try and do everything I can to remember. I want to remember as soon as I can but as I look in this mirror all I see is the reflection of someone I don't know. I see eyes that I've never seen before, I see an expression I don't know and I'm scared. What if I can't remember?  
我知道他们说这只是暂时的，但我想要知道，我需要知道。我不想只是坐在那里等待。我想尽我所能去尝试回忆。我希望尽快记起来，但当我看着镜子时，我看到的却是一个我不认识的人。我看到了从未见过的眼睛，看到了一个我不熟悉的表情，我感到害怕。如果我无法记起来怎么办？

I had the chance to find out some things about what had happened. I found out that five years ago there was a cataclysmic event that threatened the world. It was an event known as the Third Impact, it had ultimately been stopped but a large number of people had vanished as a result of it. Many of those people had since returned, they had emerged from the very same body of water that I emerged from.  
我有机会了解了一些关于发生过的事情。我得知五年前发生了一场威胁世界的灾难性事件。那次事件被称为第三次冲击，最终被阻止了，但因此有大量的人消失了。许多人在那之后陆续返回，他们正是从我出现的那片水域中出现的。

They also explained the 'Emergence Sickness' phenomenon to me too. A number of returnees had suffered from a loss of memory similar to what I have done. All of these people would recover their members in time, some of them in a few hours and others would take a few days. They had no process for helping this happen, it was said that it would just happen in time.  
他们还向我解释了‘出现症候群’现象。许多返回者经历了与我类似的记忆丧失。这些人最终都会逐渐恢复记忆，有些人只需几小时，而有些人则需要几天。他们没有帮助这一过程的方法，据说记忆会在时间中自然恢复。

All I have to do is wait. All I have to do is wait and feel this frustration within me knowing I could do nothing about it. All I can do is wait and feel fear at the thought that I might be the first who doesn't recover my memory. What if I go the rest of my life not knowing who I truly am?  
我唯一能做的就是等待。我只能忍受内心的挫败感，明知无能为力。我只能等待，一想到可能成为第一个无法恢复记忆的人，恐惧便油然而生。如果我余生都无法知晓自己真正的身份，那该怎么办？

No! I will recover them, I can… I can feel them somewhere inside of me. I know they're there, as I listened to those people today I would hear certain words and phrases that would trigger certain feelings or emotions inside of me. I must be close to remembering but it is almost as if my memories are locked behind some giant door and I need to find the key.  
不！我会找回它们的，我能……我能感觉到它们在我内心某处。我知道它们就在那里，今天听那些人说话时，某些词句会触发我内心的某些感觉或情绪。我一定快要想起来了，但记忆仿佛被一扇巨大的门锁住，我需要找到那把钥匙。

I look once again at my own reflection and I observe just how peculiar I look compared to the others here. No one mentioned anything but upon seeing my own face for the first time I can see the striking differences between myself and them. It is like I am some sort of alien amongst them. I fix my gaze at the unknown face, stare deep into the red eyes, run my hand through my grey hair and observe my pale skin.  
我再次凝视自己的倒影，观察到自己与这里的人相比是多么奇特。虽然没人提起，但第一次看到自己的脸时，我就能明显看出与他们的差异。我仿佛是他们中的异类。我凝视着这张陌生的脸，深深地注视着那双红眼睛，抚摸着灰色的头发，观察着苍白的皮肤。

Perhaps… Perhaps it would be best if I took their advice and go to sleep. Maybe in the morning I will remember. I look towards the other room and I can feel tiredness throughout my body. I will sleep, tomorrow may bring the answers I seek.  
或许……或许听从他们的建议去睡觉是最好的选择。也许到了早晨我会记起来。我望向另一个房间，感到全身疲惫。我会睡去，明天或许会带来我寻求的答案。

**January 12****th** **- Early Morning**  
1 月 12 日 - 清晨

I remember! I remember! I remember!  
我想起来了！我想起来了！我想起来了！

I awake suddenly from my restless slumber, I can feel my heart pounding rapidly in my chest and I feel the sheets cling to my sweat covered body. Tears sting my eyes as I lay on my side with my eyes wide open staring at the wall.  
我从不安稳的睡眠中猛然惊醒，能感觉到心脏在胸腔内急速跳动，汗水浸湿的身体让床单紧贴。泪水刺痛了我的双眼，我侧躺着，眼睛睁得大大的，凝视着墙壁。

I know who I am! I know what I am and… I know that I should not… I should not be here.  
我知道我是谁！我知道我是什么，而且……我知道我不应该……我不应该在这里。

As I lay on my side not daring to move my nightmare replays itself in my head. I have never dreamed before. I was… I was incapable of such things, I thought I was incapable of such things and yet I have experienced that very such thing right now. The dream was of those final moments, my taking of Evangelion Unit 02, that long trip down to Central Dogma, my conversation with Shinji and my sacrifice.  
我侧躺着，不敢动弹，噩梦在脑海中重演。我从未做过梦。我……我以为自己无法做梦，然而此刻我却经历了那样的梦境。那梦是关于那些最后的时刻，我驾驶初号机，那漫长的旅程前往中央教条区，与真嗣的对话，以及我的牺牲。

I have very little time to dwell on this as I'm suddenly hit with another new and unpleasant sensation. A sharp pain is felt in my stomach and I feel an odd queasiness and dizziness in my head. I lie still for a moment hoping it will go away before the pain turns to a burning sensation. In that moment my instincts kick in and I leap out of the bed.  
我几乎没有时间深思这个问题，因为突然间我又被一种新的、令人不快的感觉击中。腹部传来一阵剧痛，头部感到一种奇怪的恶心和眩晕。我静静地躺了一会儿，希望这疼痛会消失，但随后疼痛转为灼热感。那一刻，我的本能驱使我跳下床。

I sprint into the bathroom just in time for the feeling to completely overwhelm me. I collapse to my knees both of them hitting the tiled floor roughly and painfully. I feel more pain throughout me as I retch and throw up violently into the toilet bowl.  
我冲进浴室，正好赶上这种感觉完全压倒我。我双膝跪地，重重地摔在瓷砖地板上，疼痛难忍。我全身感到更多的疼痛，剧烈地呕吐，将胃里的东西全部吐进了马桶。

With my stomach emptied I remain still for a moment and let out a soft whimper as more tears run down my cheek. My stomach and chest hurt so much, my knees hurt from collapsing onto them. I weakly reach for a piece of toilet tissue and wipe my mouth before flushing the contents of the toilet.  
胃里清空后，我静静地待了一会儿，轻声呜咽，泪水顺着脸颊流下。我的胃和胸部疼痛难忍，膝盖也因为跪倒而疼痛。我无力地伸手拿了一张卫生纸，擦了擦嘴，然后冲掉了马桶里的内容物。

I let out another soft whimper. I remember everything now. I remember it all so clearly. I daren't move from my position in the cold bathroom. Instead I bring my knees up to my naked chest and wrap my arms around them.  
我又发出一声轻轻的呜咽。现在我全记起来了。一切都那么清晰。我不敢从冰冷的浴室里挪动位置。相反，我将自己的膝盖抱到赤裸的胸前，双臂环绕着它们。

All of those memories were rushing through my head now. I can remember it all. I can remember NERV, SEELE, my own birth and the man who raised me. I can remember Shinji with his sweet smile and innocence. I can remember his eyes when I betrayed him. I can… remember it all now and contrary to my previous wishes I wish I could forget it again.  
所有这些记忆此刻正涌入我的脑海。我全都能记起来。我记得 NERV，SEELE，我自己的诞生和抚养我的人。我记得真嗣那甜美的微笑和纯真。我记得我背叛他时他的眼神。我……现在全都能记起来，与之前的愿望相反，我真希望自己能再次忘却这一切。

I am Kaworu Nagisa… I was the last Angel mankind had to face. I should not be alive. These thoughts continue to cycle through my mind as I hug my knees tightly and my soft whimpers turn to loud sobs. I fear sleep will not find me again tonight as I sit sobbing on the hard bathroom floor.  
我是渚薰……我是人类必须面对的最后一个使徒。我不应该活着。这些念头不断在我脑海中循环，我紧紧抱着膝盖，轻声的呜咽变成了大声的哭泣。我害怕今晚无法再次入睡，坐在坚硬的浴室地板上哭泣。

**January 19****th** **– Morning** 1 月 19 日 —— 清晨

One week has passed since I emerged from the sea of souls as I have come to understand it. One week since I was somehow given a second chance at life. One whole week of nights filled with nightmares and days filled with the fear of others. I've spent each day since I recalled who I was living in fear that I will be hurt. I've spent each night terrified of going to sleep knowing that only nightmares will await me.  
自从我理解了自己是如何从灵魂之海中浮现出来，已经过去了一周。自从我不知怎么地得到了第二次生命的机会，已经整整一周了。这一周里，夜晚充斥着噩梦，白天则充满了对他人的恐惧。自从我记起自己是谁以来，每一天我都在害怕会受到伤害。每一个夜晚，我都害怕入睡，因为我知道等待我的只有噩梦。

It is something of a cruel irony, in my past life I had always wondered what it must be like to dream. I was almost envious of those Lilim who did so. I always wondered what sort of dreams I would have and wished that I were able to. Now I just wish I could be like that again. The reality is far more terrifying than the fantasy.  
这是一种残酷的讽刺，在我过去的生活中，我总是想知道做梦是什么感觉。我几乎羡慕那些会做梦的莉莉姆。我总是想知道我会做什么样的梦，并希望自己也能做梦。现在，我只希望能回到那种状态。现实远比幻想更可怕。

Yet dreams were just one thing I have had to get used to over this past week. I have been examined by this facilities medical staff, spoken to the people who brought me in and it seems I am now completely human. I am no longer an Angel, I am one of them.  
然而，梦境只是过去这一周我不得不适应的众多事物之一。我接受了这里医疗人员的检查，与带我来此的人交谈，似乎我现在已经完全变成了人类。我不再是天使，而是他们中的一员。

It is a feeling that is both liberating to me and terrifying at the same time. I find myself no longer plagued by the crippling loneliness I used to feel in that form, I also find myself no longer plagued by the call of Adam or Lilith. I am no longer able to sense the A.T. Fields of every being around me but I am also no longer able to protect myself with my own A.T. Field should the need arise.  
这种感觉对我来说既是解放，又同时令人恐惧。我发现不再被那种形态下的极度孤独所困扰，也不再受到亚当或莉莉丝的召唤所困扰。我不再能感知周围每一个存在的 A.T.力场，但同样，如果需要，我也无法再用自己的 A.T.力场来保护自己。

I have found myself struggling with the array of emotions within me. When I was an Angel I felt emotions but they were always dulled by other parts that made up myself. I perhaps did not feel them nor could I express them quite as a human would. Yet now I am feeling these things, I am feeling fear and sadness properly for the first time, it is somewhat overwhelming to get used to.  
我发现自己在应对内心复杂的情感时感到挣扎。作为天使时，我也有情感，但它们总是被构成我自身的其他部分所淡化。我或许没有感受到它们，也无法像人类那样表达它们。但现在我感受到了这些情感，我第一次真正感受到了恐惧和悲伤，这有些让人难以适应。

Again I used to wonder what it'd be like to feel those unchained emotions. To be able to express myself properly and experience what humans feel. They were always fascinating beings to me, I was always told I was above them, better than them and yet in many ways I longed to be one of them. I wondered what made me above them, what made me better than them? I know the truth now, I was not above them or better than them, I was simply different but… I have realized this truth much too late.  
曾经，我常常好奇那种无拘无束的情感体验会是什么样子。能够自如地表达自己，感受人类所经历的一切。他们对我来说总是充满魅力，我常被告知自己凌驾于他们之上，比他们更优秀，然而在很多方面，我却渴望成为他们中的一员。我曾疑惑，是什么让我凌驾于他们之上，又是什么让我比他们更优秀？如今我明白了真相，我并非凌驾于他们之上，也并非比他们更优秀，我只是与众不同……但遗憾的是，我领悟这个真相太迟了。

In speaking to me I have been assured by the people who brought me in that I am safe. That they do know who I was and what I was and that no harm will come to me. That I am to be treated the same as anyone else who has been through this process has been. It is a small comfort to me, a person who was brought up being told constantly about the negative side of humanity.  
在与我交谈中，那些将我带来的人向我保证，我是安全的。他们知道我的过去和我的身份，不会让我受到伤害。我将被同等对待，就像经历过这个过程的其他人一样。对于一个从小被不断灌输人性负面的人来说，这算是一点小小的慰藉。

As I lie in my bed my thoughts turn once again to the person who I hurt all those years ago. I wonder if these feelings of fear I have now are what he used to feel. Did you feel fear like this Shinji? Did you feel it each time before you piloted the Eva? Did you feel it before you went to school? Was this fear inside me the same as the crippling fear inside of you?  
当我躺在床上，思绪再次飘向多年前我伤害的那个人。我在想，我现在感受到的恐惧是否就是他曾经感受到的。真嗣，你曾感到过这样的恐惧吗？每次驾驶 Eva 之前，你是否都感到过这种恐惧？上学前呢？我内心的这种恐惧，是否与你那令人瘫痪的恐惧相同？

I sit myself up and look around my quarters. They are somewhat barren but larger and more homely than what I was used to in the past. In one corner is a wardrobe with a chest of drawers next to it that I am used to store the clothing I've been given by the facility staff.  
我坐起身来，环顾我的房间。虽然有些空旷，但比过去习惯的环境要大得多，也温馨得多。在一个角落里，有一个衣柜，旁边是一个抽屉柜，我习惯将设施工作人员给我的衣服存放在那里。

In an opposite corner is a small kitchen where I am able to make myself small meals and tea. The centre of the room has a small sofa with a television set up in front of it. I grab the remote control and turn the television on. Immediately I'm greeted by two hosts on some morning talk show, they seem to be discussing a news report about a recent raid on what was suspected to be a SEELE facility.  
在对角是一个小厨房，我可以在那里为自己准备简单的饭菜和茶。房间中央有一张小沙发，前面摆放着一台电视机。我拿起遥控器，打开电视。立刻，我被某个早间谈话节目的两位主持人迎接，他们似乎正在讨论一则关于最近突袭疑似 SEELE 设施的新闻报道。

I quickly change the channel not wishing to hear anything related to that organization now or in the near future. Instead I settle on some kids cartoon and leave it on in the background as I start to get changed. I get halfway through putting my trousers on before I hear a faint knock at the door.  
我迅速换了个频道，不想听到任何与那个组织现在或近期有关的消息。转而选择了一部儿童卡通片，让它在背景中播放，我开始换衣服。裤子穿到一半时，我听到了一阵轻微的敲门声。

"Just a moment." I call out to whoever it is and finish putting on the rest of my clothes. I button up my shirt and wander over to the door. Opening it reveals Kodama Horaki, the woman who found me on the beach a week ago.  
“稍等一下。”我朝门外的人喊道，并迅速穿好剩下的衣服。扣好衬衫，我漫步到门口。打开门，眼前是 Kodama Horaki，一周前在海滩上发现我的那位女士。

"Mr Nagisa." She addresses me in a formal manner, one that makes me feel slightly uncomfortable. I've never really understood formal greetings as far as humans go but it is not my lack of understanding that provides discomfort. It is that it reminds me of my first meeting with Shinji Ikari.  
“Nagisa 先生。”她以一种正式的方式称呼我，这让我感到有些不自在。我从未真正理解过人类的正式问候，但让我不舒服的并非缺乏理解。而是这种称呼让我想起了与 Shinji Ikari 的初次见面。

I force a smile to my lips, "Please... As I have said before feel free to call me Kaworu."  
我强扯出一丝微笑，“请……如我之前所说，随意称呼我为渚薰。”

She nods at me, "Fine, Kaworu it is then! How are you feeling today?"  
她朝我点点头，“好吧，那就叫你渚薰！今天感觉如何？”

I step aside and let her into the room and close the door behind her. I look for a moment and the smile leaves my lips. I consider telling her I am fine but it would not help me to lie to her.  
我侧身让她进屋，随后关上门。我凝视片刻，嘴角的笑容消失了。我本想告诉她我很好，但对她撒谎对我并无益处。

"I am... feeling better. I am still struggling with the nightmares though."  
"我感觉...好些了。不过噩梦还是困扰着我。"

Her expression softened on hearing my words, "That's understandable, a lot of people when they emerge do experience these things for a short amount of time. If they are that bad then I might be able to speak to someone to give you something?"  
她听到我的话后，表情柔和了许多，""这是可以理解的，很多人刚醒来时都会短暂经历这些。如果它们真的很严重，我可以找人给你开点什么吗？""

I shake my head, "No, I would... as frightening as they are I should deal with them. I fear that they are not just a symptom of the emergence but something else. It is just... I am not used to the experience of dreaming either."  
我摇了摇头，""不，我宁愿...尽管它们很可怕，但我应该自己面对。我担心它们不仅仅是苏醒的症状，还有别的原因。只是...我也不习惯做梦这种体验。""

"You did not dream beforehand?" She asked me with some surprise in her voice.  
"你之前没有预知到这个梦吗？" 她带着些许惊讶的语气问我。

I shake my head once again, "No I didn't. I needed to rest and sleep in my previous body but dreams were not part of that process. I was told about dreams and what they were and I did wonder what it would be like to experience one. It is... ironic that in receiving my answer it only serves to terrify me."  
我再次摇了摇头，"没有，我之前需要休息和睡眠，但梦境并不属于那个过程。我被告知了梦是什么以及它们是什么样的，我也曾好奇体验梦会是什么感觉。这真是...讽刺，得到答案后反而让我更加恐惧。

"Like I said, if you need anything we can help you."  
"就像我说的，如果你需要什么，我们可以帮你。"

"I... Thank you, I will deal with it for the moment but remember your offer."  
"我...谢谢你，我会暂时处理这件事，但请记住你的提议。"

I look awkwardly around the room searching for some words to say. Before all of this, words would come to me so easily. Now I find myself struggling for things to say to people, I find myself silent a lot of the time.  
我尴尬地环顾房间，寻找着合适的言辞。在这之前，话语总是自然而然地涌出。如今，我发现自己与人交谈时常常词穷，很多时候都沉默不语。

I look towards Kodama again. She was not only the one who found me last week but she is also the one who has been helping me figure things out and guide me somewhat. When I remembered who I was she was the first one I told. She did not seem to be angry at me or upset with me despite knowing who and what I was. She is curious and something about her is familiar yet I do not know quite what it is.  
我又看向 Kodama。她不仅是在上周找到我的人，也是一直帮助我理清思绪、引导我的人。当我记起自己是谁时，她是第一个我告诉的人。尽管知道我的身份和来历，她似乎并不生气或失望。她充满好奇，有一种熟悉感萦绕在她身上，但我又说不出那是什么。

I think of something to say and strangely one question comes to mind, "Can I ask... what is going to happen to me?"  
我想找些话说，却奇怪地冒出一个问题，“我能问……我会怎么样吗？”

I pause for a moment, "It is my understanding that this facility was made for people to stay in on a temporary basis, am I right in assuming this is the case for me too?"  
我停顿了一下，“据我所知，这个设施是为人们暂时停留而建的，我这样理解对吗？”

Kodama let's out a sigh and shifts from one leg to the other, "Well actually that is why I'm here to talk to you. Your... situation is a unique one Kaworu. There is a lot of discussion going on above me that I'm not exactly privy too."  
Kodama 叹了口气，换了个站姿，“实际上，我正是为此来和你谈的。你的……情况很特殊，Kaworu。上面有很多讨论，我并不完全知情。”

"That is... understandable." I reply.  
“那是……可以理解的。”我回答道。

"Not just because of who you were but also because of who you are now, you see usually when people emerge and we know who they are we'll start a process of tracking down friends and family."  
“不仅仅是因为你过去的身份，还因为现在的你。你知道，通常当人们出现并且我们知道他们是谁时，我们会开始追踪他们的朋友和家人。”

It's hard for me to hide the sadness in my voice a I reply to her, "And I do not have either of those."  
我很难掩饰声音中的悲伤，回答她：“而我两者都没有。”

She steps forwards and places a warm comforting hand on my shoulder, "You don't have anything?"  
她向前一步，将一只温暖抚慰的手放在我的肩上，“你什么都没有吗？”

I shake my head, "Nothing, I was born into what the world knew as SEELE. My entire existence and upbringing were based around one thing and one thing alone. I... I was not supposed to live past that moment."  
我摇摇头，“什么都没有，我出生在世人所知的 SEELE。我的整个存在和成长都是围绕着一件事，而且只有这一件事。我……我本不该活过那一刻。”

"Kaworu..." She pulls me in closer, not quite hugging me completely but just enough to comfort me.  
“薰……”她将我拉得更近，虽然没有完全拥抱我，但足以给予我安慰。

"Friends and family were something I did not know, I am... alone in this world."  
朋友和家人是我未曾了解的概念，我...在这个世界上是孤独的。

There is a brief pause, she looks like she wants to say something but is hesitant. Finally, she does actually speak, "There is always Tokyo-2... We have rehomed most of the former NERV staff there and..."  
她顿了一下，看起来想说些什么却又犹豫不决。最终，她还是开口了，“还有东京-2...我们已将大部分前 NERV 员工安置在那里，而且...”

I take a step back and feel the fear rise up inside me as I shake my head, "N-No! I.. I do not think that after what I nearly did... I don't think It would be wise for me to be in such an environment."  
我后退一步，恐惧在心中升起，我摇着头说，“不！我...我不认为经历了那几乎发生的事...我觉得我再去那样的环境是不明智的。”

She steps puts her hand up to her chin and thinks about it for a moment, "I understand. Such things can... wait for the moment. As I mentioned the discussions are going on above me so I do not know the options available yet."  
她将手放在下巴上，沉思片刻，“我明白。这类事情可以……暂且等待时机。正如我所说，讨论正在我之上进行，所以我还不清楚有哪些选项可供选择。”

"I am... a unique and complex case." I say with some humour in my voice.  
“我……是一个独特且复杂的案例。”我带着几分幽默说道。

"Yeah... You certainly are." She smiles reassuringly at me, "It might take some time Kaworu but... whilst you're here I want to make sure you have everything you need to be happy. If you... If you need anything at all just reach out and ask me."  
“是啊……你确实如此。”她微笑着安慰我，“可能需要一些时间，卡沃鲁，但……在你在这里的这段时间，我想确保你拥有一切让你快乐的东西。如果你……如果你需要任何东西，尽管向我提出。”

It is quite an odd feeling to have someone ask me what it is I desire. It's a question I've never been asked before. Usually things were just given to me with an expectation that I would do what is required and no more or less. My upbringing was orchestrated by a committee and handled by many. It was broken down into stages and mapped out for me.  
有人问我想要什么，这种感觉颇为奇异。这个问题我从未被问及。通常情况下，事情会直接交到我手上，期待我按要求行事，不多也不少。我的成长由一个委员会精心策划，由许多人共同照料。它被分解成各个阶段，为我一一规划。

So now I have to think, is there anything that I... Kaworu Nagisa want? What do I desire? What are my likes and dislikes? Who... who exactly am I? I have shelter, I have access to food and I have some small comforts like a warm bed and a television. It's all provided to me and yet I am being offered more?  
所以现在我必须思考，我，碇真嗣，究竟想要什么？我渴望什么？我的喜好和厌恶是什么？我……我究竟是谁？我有住所，有食物可享，还有一些小小的舒适，比如温暖的床和电视机。这一切都已提供给我，然而现在却有人愿意给予更多？

Part of me would feel ungrateful and uncomfortable for asking for anything else. After all is this not enough? I have not exactly done anything to warrant anything else. Yet... there is something I do desire. Something that when I think back on did make me happy in the past and might help me now. I look at Kodama, "Actually... Is there a piano in this facility?"  
我的一部分会觉得要求更多显得不知感恩且不自在。毕竟，这难道还不够吗？我并未真正做过什么来换取更多。然而……我的确有所渴望。当我回想起过去，有些东西确实曾带给我快乐，现在或许也能助我一臂之力。我看向绫波，“实际上……这里有没有钢琴？”

"A piano?" She half smiles as she asks the question and I instantly feel uncomfortable asking for such a thing. Perhaps that was too much, too big of a thing to ask for.  
"一架钢琴？" 她半笑着问，我立刻感到不安，提出这样的要求或许太过分了。可能我要求得太多了，这事儿太大了。

I nod, "Yes... I... I used to enjoy playing the piano. I think... I think it might help if I could play again?"  
我点点头，"是的...我...我以前喜欢弹钢琴。我想...如果我能再弹的话，也许会有所帮助？"

Her smile widens, "I'm not sure but... I'll see what I can do."  
她的笑容更甚，"我不确定，但...我会尽力去办。"

**January 26****th** **- Afternoon** 1 月 26 日 - 下午

My fingers dance lightly across the piano as I feel myself completely lost in my own music. I pay no attention to the book in front of me instead I allow myself to play what it is I desire. I allow myself to play without any idea of what it is that'll come next. I skip from note to note, black key to white key, shifting scale and time signature exploring the full depth of what it is I can do.  
我的手指在钢琴上轻盈跳跃，完全沉浸在自己的音乐中。我不再关注面前的书本，而是任由自己弹奏心中所想。我让自己随心所欲地演奏，不去预想下一刻会是什么旋律。我跳跃在音符之间，黑键与白键交替，变换着音阶和节拍，探索着自己所能达到的深度。

Joy lights up my heart as I play, I feel free, a sensation unlike any I have felt before. I wonder if this is is how all those great musicians felt when they composed. Lost in their music and the worlds they created with their symphonies.  
随着演奏，喜悦点亮了我的心房，我感到自由，一种前所未有的感觉。我不禁思索，那些伟大的音乐家在创作时是否也感受到了这样的心境。迷失在他们的音乐中，以及他们用交响乐创造的世界里。

Kodama had, much to my great joy been able to find a piano. An older model that had been locked away in the facilities storage. It had been brought in when the centre had opened many years ago but put away again when the number of returnees had dropped off. I was of course the first person to emerge for quite some time, it was quite a shock to the people who worked here but they also seemed somewhat pleased to have me around.  
小灵非常高兴地找到了一架钢琴。这是一台较旧的型号，被锁在设施的储藏室里。许多年前，当中心刚开放时，它被搬了进来，但随着返回者人数的减少，它又被收了起来。当然，我是相当长一段时间内第一个出现的人，这对这里的工作人员来说相当震惊，但他们似乎也有些高兴有我在这里。

Since I have returned I have learned a few things from Kodama about this place. Before my return there had been talks of actually repurposing this facility for other usage. The area around Tokyo-3 had recently been discussed as a place of interest for certain groups. I do now know what for and I do not feel I need to know but as far as I have been told until they were certain no one would return this place would remain open.  
自从我回来后，我从小灵那里了解到了一些关于这个地方的事情。在我回来之前，曾有人讨论过将这个设施改作他用。东京-3 周边地区最近被某些团体讨论为感兴趣的地方。我现在不知道是为了什么，我也不觉得我需要知道，但据我所知，在他们确定没有人会回来之前，这个地方会一直开放。

I bring my improvisation to a halt and almost immediately I hear the sounds of polite applause from behind me. I feel myself blush immensely as I turn around and see Kodama beaming at me from across the room.  
我停止了即兴演奏，几乎立刻就听到了身后礼貌的掌声。我感到自己脸红得厉害，转过身去，看到小灵在房间的另一边对我微笑。

"That was amazing Kaworu! How long have you been playing for?"  
"那真是太棒了，薰！你弹琴多久了？"

I smile nervously, I am unused to praise for my abilities, in my past I was told what I did was adequate and no more.  
我紧张地笑了笑，我不习惯因我的能力而受到表扬，过去我被告知我所做的一切只是勉强合格，仅此而已。

"As long as I can remember." I say to her, "It was... one of the few forms of entertainment I was granted access to I suppose. My former handlers felt I should have some appreciation for human culture and so the piano was chosen for me along with the works of various classical composers."  
"从我有记忆开始。"" 我回答她，""我想，这是我被允许接触的少数娱乐方式之一。我的前任监护人认为我应该对人类文化有所欣赏，于是钢琴和各种古典作曲家的作品被选中给了我。"

"Was it one of their pieces you were playing just now?"  
"刚才你弹的是他们的作品之一吗？"

I allow myself a smile and shake my head, "It was not... I was... Improvising just now. I suppose you could call it my first act of rebellion against them."  
我微微一笑，摇了摇头，“不是的……我刚才……即兴演奏。我想你可以称之为我对他们的第一次反抗。”

"Rebellion?" She asks with some curiosity.  
"反抗？" 她带着几分好奇问道。

I smile sheepishly, "When I was with them I did enjoy what I was exposed to. I truly thought it was wondrous and the very height of human culture. How people could tell stories and convey emotion with notes on a page. Yet I was limited in what I could do, I was to play only works by the so-called greats. My days were filled with endless recitals of Back, Beethoven, Mozart and so on and so forth."  
我尴尬地笑了笑，“和他们在一起时，我确实享受了我所接触到的一切。我真心认为那是奇妙的，是人类文化的巅峰。人们如何用纸上的音符来讲述故事、传达情感。然而，我所能做的有限，我只能演奏那些所谓大师的作品。我的日子充满了无尽的巴赫、贝多芬、莫扎特等人的曲目。”

"And you didn't enjoy this?"  
“那你不喜欢这样吗？”

"At the time I didn't mind but... I no longer have a desire to go back to those. I wish to create my own path."  
“当时我并不介意，但……我不再有回到那里的欲望了。我希望开创自己的道路。”

Kodama sits herself down near to me, "Sounds like some really pushy parents. So... it was just the 'greats'? No modern stuff at all?"  
小球坐在我旁边，“听起来像是些非常强势的父母。那么...只有‘经典’作品吗？完全没有现代的东西？”

"I am afraid not." I reply, "The past one hundred and fifty years or so of human popular culture is little more than a blank to me. I know a few names here and there but I cannot say I have ever watched a television show properly, I have not seen a movie nor did I listen to anything modern. I was..."  
“恐怕是的。”我回答，“过去一百五十年左右的人类流行文化对我来说几乎是一片空白。我只知道一些零星的名字，但我从未完整地看过一部电视剧，没看过电影，也没听过任何现代音乐。我……”

I trailed off as I see her stand up and come over to me. She sits herself down next to me on the bench and puts an arm around me.  
我话音未落，只见她站起身朝我走来。她在我旁边的长椅上坐下，伸手搂住了我。

"I'm... so sorry you had to go through that Kaworu."  
"我...真的很抱歉，你经历了那些，渚。"

I shrug, "It is... something I have come to accept and I suppose I did not think about it at the time. My life was driven by one purpose, one goal and that was supposed to lead humanity onto its next stage... I..."  
我耸耸肩，“这是...我已经接受的事情，我想当时我并没有多想。我的人生被一个目的、一个目标所驱动，那本应引领人类进入下一个阶段...我...”

I trail off again and sniff as I feel the emotion well up inside of me. A tear trickles down my cheek as she hugs me closer to her.  
我又一次停了下来，吸了吸鼻子，因为情感在我内心涌动。当她更紧地拥抱我时，一滴泪水顺着我的脸颊滑落。

"I was not aware of how lonely my existence was."  
“我未曾意识到自己的存在有多么孤独。”

Her arm tightens, "You don't need to be alone anymore Kaworu. There is a huge world out there and plenty of time for you to explore all sorts of things.  
她的手臂收紧，“你不再需要独自一人了，卡沃鲁。外面有一个广阔的世界，你有足够的时间去探索各种各样的事物。”

I look at her and wipe the tears away, "I am... truly sorry for what I was Kodama..."  
我看着她，擦去泪水，“我……真的为曾经的自己感到抱歉，小玉……”

"you don't have to be." She replies sternly, "What happened... It wasn't your fault. We know what SEELE did to you and also to many others. We know how they hurt and manipulated people. The best thing you can do now is move forward Kaworu..."  
"你不必这样。" 她严肃地回答，"发生的事...不是你的错。我们知道 SEELE 对你和其他许多人做了什么。我们知道他们是如何伤害和操纵人们的。你现在能做的最好的事情就是向前看，Kaworu..."

"I... I guess." "我...我想是的。"

She looks at me, "Anyway I wasn't just hear to attend your little concert, it seems you have a visitor."  
她看着我，"无论如何，我来这里不仅仅是为了参加你的小音乐会，看来你有访客了。"

I look at her in confusion, "A visitor? For me? I do not understand, I don't know anyone here unless..."  
我困惑地看着她，“访客？找我？我不明白，我在这里不认识任何人，除非……”

I can feel my eyes widen as that now familiar feeling of fear rises up inside me again. There is no one in this world I have any attachment to but one but... he could not be the visitor, could he? If he is then... no... I can't face him. I can never face him.  
我能感觉到自己的眼睛因那熟悉的恐惧感再次在内心升起而睁大。在这个世界上，我没有任何牵挂的人，除了一个……但他不可能是那位访客，对吧？如果真的是他……不……我无法面对他。我永远无法面对他。

"Actually..." Kodama speaks up, "We were a little bit confused too, we didn't... think the two of you had any connection but he has insisted on seeing you. He says he wants to help put things right for you."  
“实际上……”Kodama 开口说道，“我们也有点困惑，没想到你们俩会有什么联系，但他坚持要见你。他说他想帮你把事情摆平。”

**Meeting Room 会议室**

I'm not quite sure what to expect as I follow Kodama silently through the corridors of the facility. I try to think about who this person might be, my mind running through a number of possibilities. I had not dared to ask Kodama who this person was fearing what the answer might actually be.  
我并不完全确定会遇到什么，只是默默地跟着 Kodama 穿过设施的走廊。我试图思考这个人可能是谁，脑海中闪过多种可能性。我甚至不敢问 Kodama 这个人是谁，害怕答案会让我难以接受。

My mind had of course wondered if it might be Shinji. When I think about what I know, or at least what I knew of Shinji it would be just like him to come to me wanting to make things right. It'd be just like him to blame himself for what had happened. Yet that was the Shinji of back then, a lot will likely have changed in the five years that have passed.  
当然，我心中也曾猜测过可能是 Shinji。想到我所了解的，或者说我所知道的 Shinji，他来找我想要弥补一切，把责任归咎于自己，这完全像是他会做的事。但那是过去的 Shinji，五年过去了，很多事情可能已经改变。

I of course do not know what I would do if it were Shinji, I sincerely hope it is not him. I am not in a position to face him nor do I think I will ever be. I hurt Shinji badly, I offered him friendship and love when he was at his lowest and I betrayed him. It matters not that my feelings for him were real, I cared for Shinji, I wanted to be friends with him and despite knowing him for a short time I dare say that I felt love for him.  
当然，我不知道如果是真嗣我会怎么做，我真诚地希望不是他。我没有面对他的立场，也不认为我会有那样的勇气。我深深伤害了真嗣，在他最低谷时我给予了他友谊和爱，却背叛了他。尽管我对他的感情是真挚的，我关心真嗣，想与他成为朋友，尽管与他相识时间短暂，我敢说我对他的爱是真切的。

Yet I could not do anything to fight against the cruel masters known as SEELE or the call that I felt within my heart. Yet these things matter not, it has all happened and I cannot go back. I cannot change what transpired. I can only go on knowing that my actions helped drive Shinji to his lowest point and hope that he has maybe found some peace.  
然而，我无法对抗那些被称为 SEELE 的残酷主宰或内心深处的呼唤。但这些都无关紧要，一切已经发生，我无法回到过去。我无法改变已经发生的事。我只能继续前行，知道我的行为将真嗣推向了最低谷，并希望他或许找到了一些安宁。

I try to think of other possibilities, perhaps I can eliminate Shinji as a possibility. Kodama said she didn't think me and this other person had any connection. There were others in NERV that had encountered me only a number of time. Yet I cannot think of anyone who would wish to make anything up to me.  
我试图考虑其他可能性，也许我可以排除真嗣的可能性。Kodama 说她不认为我和这个人有任何联系。在 NERV 中，还有其他人只与我有过几次接触。然而，我想不出有谁会对我编造任何事情。

There is another possibility, perhaps a fallen member of SEELE but then… which one would have had such a change of heart? They all treated me with such disdain, like the tool that I was. Those old men would never change, I am certain of that.  
还有一种可能性，或许是 SEELE 的某个堕落成员，但随后……会是哪一个突然改变了心意呢？他们所有人都对我如此鄙夷，就像对待我这个工具一样。那些老头子绝不会改变，我对此确信无疑。

As we move into another corridor I see Kodama stop and she turns to face me, "Are you nervous?"  
当我们走进另一条走廊时，我看到 Kodama 停下脚步，她转身面对我，“你紧张吗？”

I nod, "Somewhat, I cannot imagine who it is who would wish to meet with me nor can I think of anyone who would wish to put anything right with me. If anything it is I who has a lot to put right with others."  
我点头，“有点，我想不出谁会希望见我，也想不出有谁会希望与我修复关系。如果有的话，那也是我有许多需要与他人修复的关系。”

"You know… you yourself were not to blame for what happened Kaworu." Kodama looks at me sternly as she speaks, "In your situation I think… I think all of us would have acted in the same way. You were born into that organization, you were raised by them and conditioned by them. Yet when it came to it you did not destroy us, you tried… to give us some hope and allowed humanity to go forward."  
"你知道……你本人并没有因为发生的事情而受到责备，Kaworu。" Kodama 严肃地看着我说话，"在你的处境下，我想……我认为我们所有人都会做出同样的选择。你出生在那个组织，由他们抚养和训练。然而，当那一刻来临时，你没有摧毁我们，你试图……给我们一些希望，让人类继续前进。"

I look at her and shake my head, "I hurt someone who had placed all their trust in me in the process."  
我看着她，摇了摇头，"我在过程中伤害了一个完全信任我的人。"

"Perhaps you did but… the way I see it you didn't have a choice. You didn't know better." She replied, "Things ended up alright in the end and… well you have the opportunity to have a life now. Life in Tokyo-3… wasn't easy."  
"也许你确实伤害了，但……在我看来，你别无选择。你当时并不知道更好的方法。"她回答道，"最终事情还是解决了，而且……现在你有机会过上新的生活了。在东京-3 的生活……并不容易。"

I look up at her and find it hard to hide my surprise, "You were in Tokyo-3?"  
我抬头看她，难以掩饰我的惊讶，“你曾在东京-3？”

She shoots me a grin, "Yeah! Although we actually evacuated shortly before your arrival. If things had been different… well you probably would have been one of my sisters' classmates!"  
她冲我咧嘴一笑，“是啊！不过我们其实在你到来前不久就撤离了。如果情况不同的话……你可能就成了我妹妹的同学呢！”

"Y-Your sister?" “你-你的妹妹？”

Kodama nods, "Yup! Hikari, she was the class rep at that time!"  
木灵点头，“嗯！光，她当时是班代表！”

"Of course." I mutter, now I know where I have heard Kodama's name before. Hikari was one of the students that would have been in his class. He had been given a file about his fellow classmates before he was sent to Tokyo-3.  
“当然。”我喃喃自语，现在我知道在哪里听过木灵的名字了。光是他班上的学生之一。在他被派往东京-3 之前，他曾收到过一份关于同班同学的资料。

"I… I thought your name seemed familiar… I was… SEELE give me a list of people who would have been in my class."  
“我……我以为你的名字听起来很熟悉……我……SEELE 给了我一份可能在我班上的人的名单。”

She shakes her head, "You don't need to explain, anyway we shouldn't keep our guest waiting any longer."  
她摇了摇头，“你不必解释，反正我们也不该让客人久等了。”

Kodama opens the door for me and I look into the room and fix my gaze on the elderly man wearing a dark blue suit and tie. He has a folder tucked under one arm and I'm surprised to see a warm smile on his face. He looks towards myself and Kodama and with his gaze I feel myself rooted to the spot. Of all the possibilities I did not consider that my visitor would be the former NERV Sub Commander Kozo Fuyutsuki.  
Kodama 为我打开门，我望进房间，目光定格在一位身着深蓝色西装和领带的老人身上。他腋下夹着一个文件夹，我惊讶地看到他脸上挂着温暖的微笑。他转向我和 Kodama，他的目光让我感觉自己仿佛被钉在了原地。在所有可能性中，我从未料到我的访客会是前 NERV 副指挥官 Kozo Fuyutsuki。

He bows politely, "Ms Horaki, Mr Nagisa."  
他礼貌地鞠了一躬，“Horaki 小姐，Nagisa 先生。”

I bow my head politely, "H-Hello."  
我礼貌地低下头，“您好。”

Kodama also greets him politely, "Mr Fuyutsuki."  
Kodama 也礼貌地向他打招呼，“Fuyutsuki 先生。”

I avert my eyes for a moment and look around the meeting room. It was a fairly basic affair, they had set up a small coffee table along with a couch and some comfortable chairs. A few colourful plants and pictures had been placed around the edges for decoration. Guided by Kodama I make my way into the room and sit myself down on the couch next to her.  
我短暂地移开视线，环顾会议室。这里相当简朴，他们摆放了一张小咖啡桌，还有一张沙发和几把舒适的椅子。四周点缀着一些色彩鲜艳的植物和画作。在 Kodama 的引导下，我走进房间，在她旁边的沙发上坐下。

This was most certainly not what I was expecting. I admittedly know very little about Fuyutsuki. I know what he was Gendo Ikari's right hand man at NERV and had some history with both Gendo and Yui Ikari. Outside of that I know nothing else, he was a non-factor in my mission.  
这绝对不是我所预料的。坦白说，我对冬月了解甚少。我知道他是 NERV 中碇源堂的得力助手，与碇源堂和碇唯都有一段过往。除此之外，我一无所知，他在我的任务中无关紧要。

"Thank you for arranging this." He speaks to Kodama before turning to look at me, "How are you feeling Mr Nagisa?"  
“感谢你安排这次会面。”他对儿玉说道，然后转向我，“你感觉如何，碇先生？”

I nod, "I am… feeling okay."  
我点头，“我……感觉还好。”

"That is good to hear, I understand myself that emerging from the sea is not the most pleasant of feelings. I will not take up too much of your time."  
"听到这个消息真好，我自己也深知从海中出来并不是最愉快的感觉。我不会占用你太多时间。"

"I… do not mind." I say to him before continuing and expressing my confusion, "I must admit that I am somewhat confused by your being here. It was mentioned that… well you wanted to…"  
"我…并不介意。" 我对他继续说道，表达我的困惑，"我必须承认，我对您在这里感到有些困惑。之前提到过…嗯，您似乎想要…"

"Make things up to you?" Fuyutsuki finishes my sentence for me, "Yet you do not recall us meeting. This is true, we did not meet once during your brief moments in Tokyo-3."  
"弥补你？" 冬月替我把话说完，"但你却不记得我们见过面。确实如此，在你短暂停留在第三新东京市期间，我们未曾谋面。"

I nod, "Then… what do you have to make right with me?"  
我点头，“那么……你有什么要向我弥补的吗？”

He shakes his head and sighs, "Perhaps I used the wrong phrase. I suppose… well what I am doing is a little bit selfish on my part. An attempt to make myself feel better about what happened for aiding in ruining the lives of many. Since that Third Impact I have been… making an attempt to contribute and help those who need it."  
他摇摇头叹息道，“或许我用错了词。我想……好吧，我所做的是有点自私。试图让自己对参与毁掉许多人生活的事情感觉好一些。自从第三次冲击后，我一直在……努力贡献并帮助那些需要帮助的人。”

I look at Kodama in confusion and she starts to speak, "Fuyutsuki was actually one of the founding members of this facility. He left after the first year though to travel the world and provide medical aid to those who needed it in areas damaged by the two Impact incidents. Fuyutsuki was… also instrumental in making sure the survivors of Tokyo-3 were given appropriate support and compensation packages."  
我困惑地看着 Kodama，她开始解释，“Fuyutsuki 实际上是这个设施的创始成员之一。不过他在第一年后就离开了，去世界各地为那些在两次冲击事件中受灾的地区提供医疗援助。Fuyutsuki 还……在确保东京-3 的幸存者得到适当的支持和补偿方面发挥了重要作用。”

"I… I see…" I stutter out a response, "So… you wish to help me?"  
"我…我明白了…" 我结结巴巴地回应，"那么…你是想帮助我吗？"

He nods, "I do. I'm going to be travelling to Europe shortly and will be staying in Germany for quite some time. I'm in need of an assistant to help me in my work. It will not be difficult work, nothing you couldn't learn to do easily. You will of course be paid for your work and on top of that I will ensure you have a place to stay on top of the compensation package you'll receive as a former pilot."  
他点头道，"是的。我不久将前往欧洲，并在德国停留相当长的时间。我需要一位助手协助我的工作。这不会是困难的工作，你很容易就能学会。当然，你会得到报酬，除此之外，我还会确保你有一个住处，作为前飞行员，你还将获得额外的补偿。"

I look at him in confusion, "I don't understand, surely there are many others already more qualified to do this than I. After all you know the circumstances of what I was and who I am."  
我困惑地看着他，"我不明白，肯定有许多人比我更有资格做这份工作。毕竟，你知道我的过去和我的身份。"

He nods again, "Yes I do, I know who you are and what SEELE did for you. I know that you and the other pilots have all experienced something horrible in your lives and I also know that I am partly to blame for that."  
他再次点头，“是的，我知道你是谁，以及 SEELE 为你做了什么。我知道你和其他驾驶员都曾在生活中经历过可怕的事情，我也知道我对此负有部分责任。”

He pauses for a moment to sip from his coffee, "I know that if I were to live another hundred years I could not possibly erase all the damage I have done but I wish to do what I can whilst I can."  
他停顿了一下，啜饮了一口咖啡，“我知道即使我再活一百年，也无法弥补我所造成的所有伤害，但我希望在我还能做些什么的时候尽力而为。”

"So that includes helping me?"  
“所以这包括帮助我吗？”

"Yes. I… do not expect you to answer me right away and I will not mind if you choose to reject my offer. I understand if you want to leave this place and forge a new life away from me and all of this but I ask that you at least consider it."  
"是的。我……并不期望你立刻答复，如果你选择拒绝我的提议，我也不会介意。我理解你想要离开这个地方，开启远离我和这一切的新生活，但我恳请你至少考虑一下。"

"I-I see…" I nod again as he places a folder down on the table, "In which case I shall consider your offer."  
"我明白了……" 我再次点头，他放下一个文件夹在桌上，"那么，我会考虑你的提议。"

**February 9****th** **- Facility Entranceway**  
2 月 9 日 - 设施入口处

It has been two weeks now since Fuyutsuki come to me with his offer of aiding me in starting a new life and working for him. Since his visit I looked extensively over the information he provided trying to understand what it was I would be doing. It seems that I will be aiding Fuyutsuki mostly in an administrative capacity. It seems like fairly basic things, filling out reports and mailing them for him. Handling calls and arranging appointments. All things that I feel I'm capable of doing.  
自两周前冬月向我提出帮助我开启新生活并为他工作的提议以来，自他来访后，我仔细研究了他提供的信息，试图理解我将要做的事情。看来我将主要在行政方面协助冬月。似乎都是相当基础的事情，填写报告并为他寄出。处理电话和安排预约。这些都是我觉得自己能够胜任的工作。

For accepting this role I'll be paid a wage and given my own apartment in Berlin. This will be on top of a package I'll be receiving from the UN as part of my compensation. I still don't really understand why I'm owed anything for my role in NERV. If anything I nearly destroyed their world rather than saved it.  
接受这个职位，我将获得薪水，并在柏林拥有自己的公寓。这将在我作为补偿从联合国收到的包裹之外。我仍然不太明白为什么我因为参与 NERV 的角色而欠我什么。如果说有什么的话，我差点毁了他们的世界而不是拯救了它。

As I stand here I wonder if I am right in accepting Fuyutsuki's offer. I look at this as an opportunity to finally start to learn about the world and experience what life has to offer. As I stand her though all I feel is sadness and the familiar sense of fear once more.  
当我站在这里时，我怀疑接受冬月的提议是否正确。我将此视为一个机会，终于开始了解世界并体验生活所提供的一切。然而，当我站在这里时，我所感受到的只有悲伤和再次熟悉的恐惧感。

I look behind me at the entrance to the facility that I have called my home for the last month. This place has been a safe space for me that has helped shelter me from the pain that I know waits outside its walls. It is a place where all I had to fear were the thoughts inside my head, but out here I have so much more to be afraid of.  
我回头望向那座设施的入口，过去一个月里，我称之为家的地方。这个地方曾是我安全的避风港，让我免受墙外已知痛苦的侵扰。在这里，我所恐惧的不过是脑海中的思绪，但走出这里，我有着更多需要害怕的事物。

"Nervous?" I hear Kodama's voice from behind me.  
“紧张吗？”我听到 Kodama 从身后传来的声音。

I nod, "Before… Before I was sent to Tokyo-3… Keel and the others in SEELE would often tell me about this world. They would tell me how corrupt and unsafe it was, about how dangerous humanity was. They would inform me of news reports on terrorist attacks, wars, murder, sexual assault and more. They told me about the world dark history, its many genocides, slavery and violent conquests."  
我点点头，“在被送到第三新东京市之前……Keel 和 SEELE 的其他成员经常向我描述这个世界。他们告诉我这个世界多么腐败和危险，人类有多么可怕。他们向我通报有关恐怖袭击、战争、谋杀、性侵犯等新闻。他们还向我讲述了世界黑暗的历史，多次种族灭绝、奴隶制和暴力征服。”

"They really tried to get you to believe humanity was at a dead end didn't they?"  
"他们真的试图让你相信人类已经走到了绝路，不是吗？"

I nod again, "Yes… I think that even then I knew what they were doing. I knew they were hiding the positive and beauty of the world from me. After all how could a world so bad produce the beautiful music I heard and performed?"  
我再次点头，"是的……我想那时我就知道他们在做什么。我知道他们对我隐瞒了世界的积极与美好。毕竟，一个如此糟糕的世界怎能孕育出我所听到并演奏的美丽音乐呢？"

I shuffle my feet, "I know the beauty of this world but I know it is dangerous and I am afraid."  
我挪动着脚步，"我知道这个世界的美好，但我也知道它是危险的，我感到害怕。"

"I understand, it can be scary out there."  
"我明白，外面的世界可能很可怕。"

"Also…" I pause, "I will be returning to Germany… to Berlin the… place of my 'birth' as it were."  
"还有……" 我停顿了一下，"我将回到德国……回到柏林，那个可以说是'诞生'我的地方。"

"Do you remember anything of the city?"  
"你对这座城市还有记忆吗？"

I shake my head, "Nothing, only a few pictures. I was never allowed out into the city itself. I can only remember parts of the facility that I was raised in."  
我摇摇头，“没什么，只是几张照片。我从未被允许进入城市本身。我只记得我长大的那个设施的部分区域。”

"Well it's a beautiful city from what I hear. I'm sure you'll love it."  
“听说那是个美丽的城市。我相信你会喜欢它的。”

"I hope so." I smile and watch as a black car pulls up in front of us, "I suppose that this is goodbye."  
“希望如此。”我微笑着，看着一辆黑色汽车停在我们面前，“我想这就是告别了。”

She nods before grabbing and pulling me close to her and hugging me, "Good luck Kaworu, please promise you'll stay in touch. I want to know everything okay?"  
她点点头，随即抓住我，将我拉近并拥抱我，“祝你好运，卡沃鲁，请答应我会保持联系。我想知道一切，好吗？”

I nod, "I will. Thank you for everything Kodama."  
我点头，“我会的。谢谢你的一切，小玉。”

With those words she releases me from the hug. I pick up the small suitcase I have and walk towards the car. I'm greeted by a smiling man in a suit, he takes the case from me and places it in the boot of the car. I feel a cool breeze around me as I turn and give Kodama and the facility one last glance.  
说完这些话，她松开了拥抱。我提起小行李箱，走向汽车。一位西装革履的男子微笑着迎接我，他从我手中接过箱子，放入后备箱。我转身再次看向小玉和设施，感到一阵凉风拂过。

I get into the back of the car and moments later it slowly pulls away from the facility. I now take the opportunity to take the gift Kodama has given me from my pocket. A music player filled with music of influential musicians from the late 60s through to the present day. I hear the music fill my ears as I gaze out of the window.  
我钻进车后座，片刻后车子缓缓驶离了设施。现在我有机会从口袋里拿出小玉给我的礼物。一个装满了从 60 年代末到现代有影响力的音乐家作品的音乐播放器。我听着音乐充盈耳际，目光投向窗外。

I suppose this is onward towards my new future, a future that I did not expect I would ever have.  
我想这应该是朝着我的新未来前进，一个我未曾预料会拥有的未来。

### Chapter 2: Both Sides Of The Story  
第二章：故事的两面  

**August 15th 8 月 15 日**

**Cafe – Berlin – Early Morning  
咖啡馆 – 柏林 – 清晨**

As I step out of the hot morning sun that shines overhead in Berlin and into the cool air-conditioned space that the café offers I reach up and take off my sunglasses. I look around and see a few people are here already. University students mostly come to study or recover from a night out drinking. Finally, I spot my target, a small and empty seat by the window, a perfect spot for me. I walk over and set my laptop down on the table, plug it into the wall socket and prepare to start my work.  
当我走出柏林头顶炽热的晨光，步入咖啡馆提供的凉爽空调空间时，我伸手摘下了太阳镜。环顾四周，发现已经有几个人在这里了。大多是大学生，来这里学习或从一夜畅饮中恢复。最终，我找到了目标，一个靠窗的小空位，对我来说再合适不过了。我走过去，把笔记本电脑放在桌上，插上电源，准备开始工作。

I'm barely able to load up the document before I hear a loud voice from behind me call out my name, "Asuka! It's so nice to see you, your usual?"  
我还没来得及打开文档，就听到身后一个响亮的声音喊出了我的名字，“明日香！见到你真高兴，还是老样子吗？”

I turn to look and call back with a grin, "Of course!"  
我转过身，笑着回应道：“当然！”

I see the source of the voice get to work behind the counter. He's the owner of this café, a short, jolly rotund man with a bushy blonde moustache. I always thought he looked a bit out of place running a café like this. He looks more like he'd be at home as one of the Gauls from and Asterix and Obelix comic.  
我看到声音的主人在柜台后忙碌起来。他是这家咖啡馆的老板，一个矮小、圆润且总是笑呵呵的男人，留着浓密的金色八字胡。我一直觉得他经营这样一家咖啡馆有些格格不入。他看起来更像是从《阿斯泰利克斯历险记》里走出来的高卢人。

Yet here he is running a café like this, not only does he run it but he is very good at it. It's become quite a popular little place since it opened up about a year ago. I come here frequently to get on with my work.  
然而，他就在这里经营着这样一家咖啡馆，不仅经营得有声有色，而且非常擅长。自从大约一年前开业以来，这里已经变得相当受欢迎。我经常来这里工作。

In barely any time at all I find him stood behind me, setting my coffee down on the table.  
几乎没过多久，我就发现他站在我身后，将我的咖啡放在桌上。

I smile politely, "Thank you, is it only you wokring today?"  
我礼貌地微笑，“谢谢，今天只有你一个人上班吗？”

He shakes his head, "Sofia should be coming in shortly. So, what are you working on?"  
他摇摇头，“索菲亚应该很快就会来。那么，你在忙什么呢？”

I shrug, "Nothing overly important. I'm just trying to finish up a few edits for the book before I send it off to the publishers for review. It's still a bit of a rough draft but it seems they want to make the announcement early and get some previews made. They want to make sure they get the news out of the sequel whilst there is still some hype for the original."  
我耸耸肩，“没什么特别重要的。我只是想在把书稿发给出版社审阅之前，完成一些修改。虽然还是个粗糙的草稿，但他们似乎想提前宣布并制作一些预览。他们希望在原作还有些热度的时候，确保续集的消息能及时发布。”

"Oh! How exciting!" He booms, "Does that mean you'll be getting interviewed by the press?"  
"哦！多令人兴奋啊！" 他大声说道，"那是不是意味着你将要接受媒体的采访了？"

"No chance!" I exclaim and shake my head, "I'm not even bothered if the damn thing gets published. It was just because a friend opened their mouth to someone the first one got published, I just want to write them."  
"没门！" 我大声否认并摇摇头，"我根本不在乎那玩意儿会不会出版。只是因为一个朋友对某人说了什么，第一篇才得以发表，我只想写它们。"

"You don't fancy even a small bit of the publicity from it?"  
"你难道一点都不向往由此带来的那点儿名气吗？"

"Like I care about something like that!" I snort with laughter, "Why do you think I write under a pseudonym? I don't need to be noticed or popular, other people can do all that."  
“像我会在乎那种事似的！”我嗤之以鼻，笑了起来，“你以为我为什么要用笔名写作？我不需要被关注或受欢迎，其他人可以做这些。”

For a brief moment it seems as though his expression changes to one of disbelief or confusion but in a second he goes back to his smiling self. I suppose I can maybe forgive his confusion, after all it is perhaps strange that someone would go to the effort of working so hard on something like I did and when it's out there not wishing for any publicity but he doesn't know me. He doesn't know the real me anyway.  
有那么一瞬间，他似乎露出了难以置信或困惑的表情，但很快又恢复了笑容。我想我可以理解他的困惑，毕竟有人如此努力地创作，却不希望得到任何关注，这或许很奇怪。但他并不了解我，无论如何，他不知道真正的我。

Maybe once upon a time I'd have welcomed the publicity and opportunity to be noticed. I'd have demanded the publicity and been on hand to sign copies and have my name be known. I'm no longer that person though. Now I just want peace and quiet and for people to leave me alone. I'm not that bratty kid who demanded to be seen and be the centre of attention. I no longer desire for people to praise me constantly and worship the ground I walk on.  
也许曾经我会欢迎曝光和被关注的机会。我会要求曝光，亲自签名售书，让我的名字广为人知。但我已不再是那个人了。现在我只想要平静和安宁，希望人们不要打扰我。我不再是那个要求被看见、成为焦点的任性孩子。我不再渴望人们不断地赞美我，崇拜我走过的地面。

I am no longer Asuka Langley Soryu, the brash Evangelion pilot. I'm Asuka Langley Soryu, I live in Berlin and I write teen fiction as a hobby. Somehow, I managed to be quite good at it, a part of me isn't surprised though. It's not as if I don't normally become good at things I turn my hand to.  
我不再是那个鲁莽的 EVA 驾驶员——惣流·明日香·兰格雷。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，住在柏林，业余时间写写青少年小说。不知怎么的，我在这方面做得相当不错，虽然内心某处并不感到意外。毕竟，我通常一旦着手做什么事，总能做得很好。

Of course, to the owner of this café I'm just known as Asuka, a half Japanese, half German 19-year-old who has lived in the city all my life. He knows nothing of who I was, of who I used to be and nowadays no one knows that anymore. I made sure that no one would know where or who I was when I left Japan. I asked for all my records to be replaced with fresh ones, nothing would tie me to what had happened anymore. I asked for all contact to be cut off and to be left alone by the UN or whatever it was NERV would become.  
当然，在这家咖啡馆老板的眼中，我只是明日香，一个半日本半德国血统的 19 岁女孩，一生都生活在这个城市。他对我过去的身份一无所知，如今也没人再知晓了。离开日本时，我确保没有人会知道我的过去或我是谁。我要求用全新的记录替换掉所有旧档案，不再有任何东西能将我与那些往事联系起来。我请求切断所有联系，并希望联合国或无论 NERV 将变成什么组织，都不要来打扰我。

I'm not stupid though, I know that they're still out there watching me. I can sense their presence much in the same way that I could when I was younger. It's not Section 2 anymore but someone else but I know they're there. I was tempted at one point to contact them to tell them to stop and that they didn't need to watch over me but it'd just be more unnecessary hassle that I didn't need. Besides contacting them was a risk, if I contacted them the wrong person might say something and that would lead to people know where I was. So, I'll allow it for now, as long as they keep their distance and no promises get broken.  
我并不傻，我知道他们还在外面监视我。我能感觉到他们的存在，就像我年轻时那样。不再是第二区了，而是其他人，但我知道他们在那里。曾经有一刻我想联系他们，告诉他们停止监视，我不需要他们保护，但这只会带来不必要的麻烦。而且联系他们有风险，如果联系错了人，可能会泄露我的位置。所以，我现在允许他们这样做，只要他们保持距离，不违背承诺。

I'm about to go back to the document when I hear the owners voice again, "Will you be having lunch? Eggs are nice and fresh this morning."  
我正要回到文件前，又听到了主人的声音，“您要吃午饭吗？今天早上的鸡蛋很新鲜。”

My stomach rumbles at his offer, I skipped breakfast this mornign and it is coming up to lunch time. Maybe I should eat before I start work. I shoot him a smile, "Sound good, eggs it is then, scrambled and with bacon, sausage and toast I think."  
他的提议让我的肚子咕咕叫了起来，我今早没吃早餐，现在快到午饭时间了。也许我应该先吃点东西再开始工作。我对他笑了笑，“听起来不错，那就来份炒蛋，再加培根、香肠和吐司吧。”

**Tokyo 2 – Afternoon 东京 2 号——午后**

I'm sat nervously in the reception area of the building the UN has here in Tokyo-2. Laid carefully at my feet is my cello case and my eyes keep up a pattern of moving from the case to the clock on the wall and then at the receptionist as she does her work. It's been half an hour since I came in here and this pattern was started. All I want is for Misato to be finished with her meeting so that we can go home.  
我紧张地坐在联合国在东京 2 号设立的办公楼接待区。我的大提琴箱小心地放在脚边，我的目光不断在琴箱、墙上的时钟和正在工作的接待员之间来回移动。自从我半小时前进来这里，这种模式就开始了。我只希望美里能结束她的会议，这样我们就可以回家了。

I don't like being outside any longer than is necessary, if I can help It I barely go outside at all. I'm I'm told to then I will but most of the time I always have to be accompanied by someone. Being outside on my own terrifies me. I'm scared that someone might recognize me, know about me and what I've done.  
我不喜欢在外面待太久，如果可以的话，我几乎不外出。如果被要求外出，我会去，但大多数时候我总是需要有人陪同。独自在外面让我感到恐惧。我害怕有人可能会认出我，知道我的事情和我所做的一切。

There is a part of me that is trying hard to reject that. It's there using Misato's words, or the words of my friends to tell me that no one is going to recognize me and even if they did I haven't done anything wrong. They tell me that no one knows any of the pilot's identities and the pilots are the ones who saved the world, especially me.  
我内心有一部分正竭力抗拒这一点。它用美里的话，或是朋友们的言辞来告诉我，没有人会认出我，即便他们认出来了，我也没做错什么。他们告诉我，没有人知道任何驾驶员的身份，而这些驾驶员正是拯救了世界的人，尤其是我。

Yet those voices are so easily surprised by a louder one. It sounds like myself and it tells me that everyone I pass in the street secretly knows who I am and one day one of them is going to hurt me. It tells me that if they did hurt me that I deserve it. It tells me that when it does happen I'll have no one to blame but myself because I was really the one who nearly caused this world to end, I was the one responsible for the Third Impact and for ruining so many people's lives.  
然而，这些声音很容易被一个更响亮的声音所惊扰。那个声音听起来像是我自己，它告诉我，我在街上遇到的每个人其实都暗中知道我是谁，总有一天其中一个人会伤害我。它告诉我，如果他们真的伤害了我，那是我应得的。它告诉我，当这一切发生时，我只能怪自己，因为实际上是我差点导致了这个世界末日，我是引发第三次冲击和毁掉无数人生活的罪魁祸首。

I shake my head slightly, no. I mustn't think that. It wasn't like that, I wasn't to blame. I know it. I know I wasn't to blame.  
我轻轻摇头，不，我不能这么想。事实并非如此，我不是罪魁祸首。我知道的，我知道我不是罪魁祸首。

"Mr Ikari?" "碇先生？"

I nearly jump out of my seat at the sudden sound of the receptionist's voice. I look up to see her looking at me with an amused look on her face. I start to blush thinking about what an idiot I must have looked like.  
接待员突如其来的声音几乎让我从座位上跳起来。我抬头一看，只见她正带着一丝戏谑的表情看着我。想到自己刚才那副傻样，我不禁脸红起来。

"Can I get you something whilst you wait?"  
"您在等待的时候需要点什么吗？"

I shake my head, "N-No... No, thank you."  
我摇摇头，“不……不用了，谢谢。”

With those words the silence fills the room once more and I go back to my routine of looking from the clock to my cello case. I decide to leave the receptionist out of this now, still feeling like an idiot for jumping like that. In a way I'm thankful for that moment, it stopped the negative thoughts for a moment and now I can work on that.  
说完这些话，寂静再次填满了房间，我又回到了从时钟看到大提琴箱的日常。我决定现在不把接待员牵扯进来，仍然觉得自己刚才那样跳起来像个傻瓜。在某种程度上，我感谢那一刻，它让负面思绪暂时停止，现在我可以专注于处理这些了。

I need to remember what I've been told. Just slow my breathing and go through it all calmly. I knew something like this might happen today but I just need to remember what I tell myself when I go to school or out to get groceries. This is just slightly different to those times, I'm out longer and in a different part of the city.  
我需要记住别人告诉我的话。只需放慢呼吸，平静地应对一切。我知道今天可能会发生类似的事情，但我只需要记住自己去学校或外出购物时对自己说的话。这次只是稍微不同，我外出时间更长，身处城市的另一个区域。

I glance back down at my cello case as I keep making an effort to calm myself down. It's been a long time since I've played the thing. The last time was that night so many years ago, a night that is still fresh in my memory for all the wrong reasons. It feels like that night was the beginning or end of something, nothing that followed it was good and it was all my fault. If only I had acted differently then maybe... No... I can't... not again.  
我再次低头看向我的大提琴箱，努力让自己平静下来。已经很久没有碰过这把琴了。上次演奏还是在许多年前的那个夜晚，那个因种种错误原因而记忆犹新的夜晚。感觉那个夜晚是某种开始或结束，之后的一切都不好，而且都是我的错。如果当时我能有不同的举动，也许……不……我不能再这样了。

I feel my hands clench into a fist, my nails dig into the flesh in frustration as I once again try to get rid of those negative thoughts. It's just so difficult to do that today, I thought it would be but I just didn't know how hard. Why am I remembering that night, it happened years ago and I did nothing wrong. She did nothing wrong we were all... different then. You're not that Shinji anymore and Asuka... well she's gone now so that doesn't matter.  
我感到双手紧握成拳，指甲因沮丧而深深陷入肉中，我再次试图摆脱那些负面思绪。今天这样做太难了，我本以为会如此，只是没想到会这么难。我为什么要记起那个夜晚，那已经是多年前的事了，我并没有做错什么。她也没有做错，我们当时都……不一样。你不再是那个真嗣了，而明日香……她已经离开了，所以那已经不重要了。

I look up just in time to see the door under the clock open suddenly. I see two people enter the lobby in suits and for just a brief moment I see one of them look over at me with what seems to be a confused look on his face.  
我及时抬头，正好看到时钟下的门突然打开。我看到两个人穿着西装进入大厅，就在那一瞬间，我看到其中一人似乎带着困惑的表情朝我这边看了一眼。

He recognizes me, doesn't he? That's why he's looking at me like that! Any moment now he's going to come over here and I'll be...  
他认出我了，对吧？所以他才会那样看着我！随时他都可能走过来，而我将会……

My fingers dig more into my hands and the pain briefly snaps me out of it. Of course, he doesn't recognize me. He's probably confused as to what a 19-year-old kid is doing in a UN building with a cello at his feet.  
我的手指更加用力地掐进手掌，疼痛让我短暂地清醒过来。当然，他没有认出我。他大概只是困惑一个 19 岁的孩子怎么会在联合国大楼里，脚边还放着一把大提琴。

I know this, I know all of this. It makes sense and it's so logical but even with that I can't help but be terrified of them as they pass by me. I can't help but be sure I feel their eyes on me, piercing through me as if they know exactly who and what I am. I can feel time slow down as they go past me and I focus solely on the cello case. I feel sick and my leg starts to tremble slightly.  
我知道这些，我全都知道。这一切都合情合理，逻辑清晰，但即便如此，当他们从我身边经过时，我还是忍不住感到恐惧。我无法不确信我能感觉到他们的目光落在我身上，仿佛能穿透我，知道我究竟是谁，是什么。随着他们从我身边走过，我感到时间似乎变慢了，我全神贯注于大提琴箱上。我感到恶心，我的腿开始微微颤抖。

I hate this, I hate this so much. They're just ordinary people walking past. They aren't going to hurt me or recognize me. Yet it isn't until they finally pass through the entrance to the building and out onto the street that I can let go of the breath I've been holding, unclench my fist and start to try to calm down.  
我讨厌这样，我非常讨厌。他们只是普通的行人路过。他们不会伤害我，也不会认出我。然而，直到他们终于穿过建筑物的入口，走到街上，我才能松开一直屏住的呼吸，松开紧握的拳头，开始尝试平静下来。

This is too much, I should have just gone straight home rather than come here. I thought I was being brave but I'm just hurting myself by doing this. Thankfully I don't have to wait too much longer before the door opens and Misato walks through.  
这太过分了，我本应该直接回家，而不是来这里。我以为自己很勇敢，但这样做只是在伤害自己。幸运的是，我不用等太久，门就开了，Misato 走了进来。

"Shinji!" "真嗣！"

She doesn't hide her surprise at seeing me sat there waiting for her. I know she'd have expected me to go straight home after the lesson, she of all people knows how hard on me it is to be out like this. I half smile at her and nod, "H-Hey Misato."  
看到我坐在那里等她，她没有掩饰自己的惊讶。我知道她本以为我上完课后会直接回家，她最清楚我这样外出有多难。我朝她半笑了一下，点了点头，"嗨，Misato。"

She rushes over to me looking apologetic, "I'm so sorry I'm late! The meeting ran longer than I expected, have you been here long?"  
她急匆匆地朝我走来，面带歉意，“真对不起，我迟到了！会议比预期的要长，你等很久了吗？”

I stand up, "N-No... not too long anyway. Is everything alright?"  
我站起身，“不...不，也没等多久。一切都还好吗？”

She smiles at me and nods her head, "Everything is fine! I'll tell you about it in the car, I imagine you'll want to just get home now. We'll order food tonight, is that okay?"  
她对我微笑着点点头，“一切都好！我们上车再说吧，我想你现在可能只想回家。今晚我们点外卖，这样可以吗？”

I give her a nod and we make our way out of the building towards the car park. A few moments later I'm loading my cello into the boot of her car, a white Mazda Cosmo which she got shortly after we returned from the Third Impact. It was something she got to replace her Alpine and if I'm being honest I much prefer this car.  
我向她点头示意，我们便朝着停车场走去。片刻后，我将大提琴装进她的白色马自达 Cosmo 后备箱，这辆车是她从第三次冲击归来后不久买的，用以替代她的 Alpine。说实话，我更喜欢这辆车。

As I get into the front passenger seat and put my seatbelt on I already begin to feel a lot calmer. Even more so now that Misato is here.  
当我坐进副驾驶座并系好安全带时，已经感到平静了许多。尤其是现在美里在这里。

Misato gets into the driver's seat and gives me a sympathetic look. My nervous state clearly not going unnoticed by her, she places a calming hand on my leg and speaks, "I'm really proud of you Shinji, I know today won't have been easy for you."  
美里坐进驾驶座，给了我一个同情的眼神。她显然注意到了我的紧张状态，她轻轻地将安抚的手放在我的腿上，说道：“真嗣，我真的很为你骄傲，我知道今天对你来说并不容易。”

I hate it when Misato says she's proud of me. I always feel that little sting of tears behind my eyes when she does so. They're just words I was so unused to hearing and that I never thought I'd hear from anyone and I know she means it. I don't know if I can really express how much hearing that means to me from her, even if it is for something as simple as leaving our apartment.  
我讨厌 Misato 说她为我感到骄傲。每当她这么说时，我总感觉眼后隐隐有泪意。这些话我太不习惯了，也从没想过会有人对我说，我知道她是真心的。我不知道是否能真正表达出从她那里听到这些话对我意味着什么，哪怕只是因为我离开了我们的公寓。

"It... was really hard Misato." I admit to her with a weak smile, "I kept on thinking that at any one moment he was going to realize who I was. I... I don't know if I can do this."  
“这……真的很难，Misato。”我虚弱地笑着向她承认，“我一直想着他随时可能意识到我是谁。我……我不知道我是否能做到。”

The car starts to move onto the street, she keeps her eyes focused on the road as she talks to me, "Well you've done it once Shinji and that is something. It's really up to you whether or not you want to do it again."  
车子开始驶上街道，她目光始终盯着前方，边和我说话，“你已经成功过一次了，真嗣，这是件了不起的事。是否再做一次，真的取决于你自己。”

"Do you think I should?" I ask.  
"你觉得我应该吗？" 我问道。

"That's not my decision Shinji, that's yours to make. Do you want to continue?" Her tone shifts to sound a bit more serious, I already know what she is going to say next, "I don't want you to be doing this for me or for anyone else. I don't want you to do it because I said it might be good for you. You have to do this for yourself, you know I'll be proud of you no matter what, you're like a... no you are my son Shinji and I love you and want you to be happy."  
"这不是我的决定，真嗣，这是你自己的选择。你想继续吗？" 她的语气变得严肃了一些，我已经知道她接下来要说什么了，"我不想你为了我或任何人做这件事。我不想你因为我觉得这对你有好处才去做。你必须为自己做这件事，你知道无论怎样我都会为你骄傲，你就像……不，你就是我的儿子，真嗣，我爱你，希望你快乐。"

There is that phrase again and also the reminder that I am her son now. It's hard to blind away the emotion this time but I manage it. I take a moment to think about what she has said though. This is another thing I need to learn on top of not being afraid of everyone I encounter. I need to do things for myself.  
那句话再次出现，还有我现在是她儿子的提醒。这次很难忽视这种情感，但我还是做到了。我花了一点时间思考她的话。这是我需要学习的另一件事，除了不再害怕遇到的每个人之外。我需要为自己做事。

"I think I'll continue." I finally say after about a minute of thought, "I did... I really enjoyed the lesson despite being afraid."  
"我想我会继续下去。" 我终于在思考了一分钟后说道，"我确实……尽管害怕，但我真的很享受这堂课。"

"So, it went alright?" "那么，一切还顺利吗？"

I nod, "The teacher said I was a lot more advanced than he was expecting. He said that I didn't seem to have lost much of my ability over the years I haven't been playing. He could see where I was rusty and said it'll be a matter or practicing and going back over some of the things I've forgotten."  
我点头，"老师说我比他预期的要进步得多。他说我这些年没玩似乎并没有失去太多能力。他能看到我在哪些地方生疏了，并说这只是一个练习和复习一些遗忘内容的问题。"

I look around to see an eager look in Misato's eye, "Do you need anything? Books? New string? A new bow? Cleaning products? A stand?"  
我环顾四周，看到美里眼中热切的目光，“你需要什么吗？书？新弦？新弓？清洁用品？支架？”

I laugh at her enthusiasm, "No I don't need anything yet, I made sure it was all in good condition before I went to the lesson. My teacher let me know a website where I can buy sheet music too."  
我被她的热情逗笑了，“不，我现在什么都不需要，上课前我已经确保一切都处于良好状态。我的老师还告诉我一个可以购买乐谱的网站。”

"Well that's good then!" “那就好！”

"Yeah it is! I just…" I trail off as I remember what happened towards the end of the lesson.  
“是啊！我只是……” 我话说到一半，突然想起了课快结束时发生的事。

Misato of course notices what, "What?"  
美里当然注意到了，“什么？”

I try to shrug it off, "No… It's nothing…"  
我试图耸耸肩掩饰过去，“没什么……真的没什么……”

"Oh no you don't!" I cringe in my seat and look towards the window, "What is it Shinji?"  
“哦，不，你别想！”我缩在座位里，望向窗外，“怎么了，真嗣？”

I let out a sigh, "Well it's just… my teacher said that he would like to eventually get me on to playing with other people… Maybe even put on a performance one day."  
我叹了口气，“嗯，就是……我的老师说，他希望将来能让我和其他人一起演奏……也许有一天还能登台表演。”

I turn to see her nod, "I see… and what did you say to him?"  
我转头看她点头，“我明白了……那你跟他说了什么？”

"I kinda…" I shrink further down in my seat, "I said yes."  
"我有点…" 我更深地缩进座位里，"我答应了。"

"Even though you knew it might have been a problem for you?"  
"即使你知道这可能会给你带来问题？"

"I just…" I start but trail off and let out a sigh, "He seemed happy when he suggested it so I… I didn't mention it might have been a problem for me."  
"我只是…" 我开口却没说完，叹了口气，"他提出时看起来很高兴，所以我就… 我没提这可能会给我带来问题。"

I shake my head as I return to looking out of the window. I know what she is thinking and it's the same thing I'm thinking. For all the progress I might have made over the years I'm still that same old Shinji. I'm still just saying and going along with things just because it'll make others happy with me.  
我摇了摇头，重新望向窗外。我知道她在想什么，那也正是我在想的。尽管这些年我可能有所进步，但我依然是那个老样子，依旧是那个真嗣。我仍然只是随声附和，顺从行事，只因为这样会让别人对我感到满意。

"Is that something you would like to do?"  
“那是你想做的事吗？”

I hear her ask but I continue looking out of the window pretending I didn't hear her. For doing that she prods me in the leg and asks again, "Shinji! Is that something you would like to do?"  
我听到她问，但我继续假装没听见，望着窗外。为此，她戳了戳我的腿，再次问道：“真嗣！那是你想做的事吗？”

All I can do this time is muster up a simple shrug, "I don't know… I mean I do like playing and I want to continue but the idea of playing with others I just… I don't think I'm ready for it yet. I don't know… If I'll ever be ready but I also… I don't want him to be mad with me or disappointed."  
这次我能做的只有简单地耸耸肩，“我不知道……我的意思是，我喜欢演奏，也希望能继续下去，但和其他人一起演奏的想法，我只是……我觉得自己还没准备好。我不知道……我是否会有准备好的一天，但我也不想……让他对我生气或失望。”

"Well you have to explain that to him Shinji. I'm sure he isn't going to be mad or disappointed. I'm sure he'll understand, it's not an easy thing for anyone to do." She replied, "I'm sure he's just enthusiastic about his new student. Just… do what is right for you Shinji."  
“嗯，你得向他解释清楚，真嗣。我相信他不会生气或失望的。我确信他会理解的，这对任何人来说都不是件容易的事。”她回答道，“我敢肯定他对新学生充满热情。只是……做对你自己正确的事，真嗣。”

I nod and look back out of the window, "I… I'll try."  
我点点头，再次望向窗外，“我……我会试试。”

**Berlin – Early afternoon 柏林 —— 午后时分**

I set my coffee down on the table and give my recent edits another quick glance. I'm still not completely satisfied with what I have there but it'll have to do for now, it's something I can send to my publisher at the very least. I swap to my e-mail client and begin to write the e-mail.  
我将咖啡放在桌上，再次快速浏览了一遍最近的修改。我对现有的成果仍不完全满意，但眼下只能如此，至少这是可以发给出版商的内容。我切换到电子邮件客户端，开始撰写邮件。

Before I click on the send button I take a moment to prepare myself for what will come next. I ask myself if I really want to do this, if I really want to go through that again. The first time was just an accident, it was never supposed to happen. It shouldn't have happened but she… she persuaded me. Appealed to that stupid pride that lingers inside of me.  
在点击发送按钮之前，我稍作停顿，为即将到来的事情做好心理准备。我问自己是否真的想这么做，是否真的想再次经历这一切。第一次只是个意外，本不该发生的。它不应该发生，但她……她利用了我那愚蠢的骄傲，说服了我。

So I'll send this off and then they'd release the press release. I'd see it in the media with my pseudonym on it. After that I'll start getting the stupid requests to talk to the press, they'll tell me how good of an opportunity it'll be and how it'd be cool for people to meet the person behind the book. Just as with the first book I'll decline it all and stay anonymous. The publisher can handle all of that.  
所以我会把这稿子发出去，然后他们就会发布新闻稿。我会在媒体上看到我的笔名。之后，我就会开始收到那些愚蠢的请求，让我接受媒体采访，他们会告诉我这是个多好的机会，让人们认识书背后的作者有多酷。就像第一本书时一样，我会拒绝所有这些请求，保持匿名。出版社可以处理所有这些事。

It wouldn't be cool for any of them to meet the person behind the book because of who the person behind the book really is. I don't want to be known, I don't deserve to be known not after… not after everything I used to be. I'm trying to get away from all that and somehow I've ended up with this situation. A part of me wishes I had never been persuaded to take the first book to a publisher. Not people are going to expect things and… I know I'll eventually let them down. Just like I did before.  
他们中没有人会因为书背后的真实身份而觉得认识作者很酷。我不想被人知道，我不配被人知道，尤其是在……在经历了我曾经的一切之后。我试图远离那些过去，不知怎么的，我却陷入了这种境地。我的一部分希望自己从未被说服将第一本书交给出版社。现在人们会期待一些事情，而我……我知道我最终会让他们失望。就像我以前那样。

I sigh and look at the screen trying to force those thoughts out of my mind but I know now will come the other feelings. Those fears that I sometimes get when I look around in crowded spaces and I see other people looking at me. Of course they're not looking at me really but I can't help but think that. Third Impact had that effect on me, for a brief moment I was… we were all linked as one being. Of course I can't remember any of it and I know no one else can. Most of them don't even know it happened but I do and it's enough for me to worry.  
我叹了口气，盯着屏幕，试图将这些念头赶出脑海，但我知道接下来会有其他感觉涌上心头。那些我在拥挤的空间里环顾四周时偶尔会产生的恐惧，看到其他人似乎在盯着我。当然，他们并不是真的在看我，但我忍不住这么想。第三次冲击对我产生了那种影响，有那么一瞬间，我……我们所有人都被连接成一个存在。当然，我记不清任何细节，也知道其他人同样无法回忆。他们中的大多数甚至不知道这件事发生过，但我记得，这足以让我担忧。

What if one of them recognizes me? What if they figure out I was the one who nearly caused the Third Impact? I was the spiteful, hateful person that nearly pushed Shinji towards it. I was the abusive one who failed everyone and took it out on whoever was nearby. I was…  
如果他们中的某个人认出了我怎么办？如果他们发现我就是那个差点引发第三次冲击的人怎么办？我就是那个充满怨恨、几乎将真嗣推向深渊的人。我就是那个对所有人施暴、失败后迁怒于身边人的家伙。我就是……

I clench my hand into a fist and bring it down on my knee carefully enough that no one will see it but just enough for me to feel it. The short burst of pain brings me out of this spiral. I look back at the screen, I have an e-mail to send.  
我紧握拳头，小心翼翼地捶打在膝盖上，确保没人看到，但足以让我感受到。这短暂的疼痛让我从这种螺旋中抽离出来。我再次看向屏幕，有一封电子邮件要发送。

I'm about to hit the send button when my phone starts to vibrate on the table top. I contemplate ignoring it but a quick look at the caller ID and I grab it and answer immediately, "Hello!"  
我正要按下发送键，手机却在桌面上震动起来。我本想无视它，但瞥了一眼来电显示后，我立刻抓起手机接听，“喂！”

A few moments later a very soft and familiar voice is heard through the other end, _"Hello Asuka! I was just calling to see how you were?"_  
片刻后，电话那头传来一个柔和而熟悉的声音，“你好，明日香！我只是打电话来看看你怎么样了？”

I lean back in my seat and smile, "I'm doing fine! I'm actually just about to send out a sample of the next book to the publisher!"  
我靠在椅背上，微笑着说，“我很好！实际上，我正准备把下一本书的样稿发给出版社呢！”

_"Oh good!"_ She replies, _"So is it nearly finished?"_  
"哦太好了！" 她回答，"那是不是快完成了？"

"Mostly, I still need to work on some details for the ending and I'm not overly happy with a few of the scenes but it's good enough for them to look at. How come you're calling me now anyway? I thought you said you'd be in America around now?"  
"基本上，结尾的一些细节还需要打磨，有几个场景我也不太满意，但给他们看看足够了。话说回来，你现在怎么打电话给我？我记得你说过这时候会在美国的？"

There is another pause before she replies, _"I was but I'm actually at the airport about to board a plane for Germany. Would you like to meet up?"_  
她停顿了一下才回答，"我原本是的，但现在我在机场，正准备登机去德国。你想见个面吗？"

I feel myself frown at hearing her say that, my heart rate picks up just a little bit and I grip my laptops mouse a bit tighter in my hand, "Is there anyone with you?"  
听到她这么说，我不禁皱起了眉头，心跳微微加速，手中紧握着笔记本电脑的鼠标，问道：“你身边有人吗？”

_"No one, I am alone."  
“没有，我一个人。”_

"Will anyone know about it? Will you… will you be telling them where you are?"  
“会有人知道这件事吗？你会……你会告诉他们你在哪里吗？”

There is another pause and her voice comes back, it's easy to hear the disappointment, _"If you do not wish me to come then I will not. I will not inform them though and they still do not know I am in contact with you."_  
又是一阵沉默，她的声音再次传来，失望之情清晰可闻，“如果你不希望我来，那我就不来。但我不会告诉他们，他们仍然不知道我和你有联系。”

My frown deepens at hearing her disappointment, "No it's… I want to I just… you know the situations. I-I'm sorry I make you do that but you understand why don't you?"  
听到她的失望，我的眉头皱得更深了，“不，不是……我想要你来，只是……你知道情况的。我——我很抱歉让你这么做，但你明白为什么，对吧？”

_"I am your friend Asuka and I do understand. It will just be me and I promise they will not get to know unless it is something you want."  
“我是你的朋友，明日香，我理解。只有我会来，我保证他们不会知道，除非这是你想要的。”_

"Okay then! We'll meet up. When will you be here?"  
“好的！我们会面吧。你什么时候到？”

_"My flight will arrive late tonight in Germany, so tomorrow morning. Do you still live in the same place?"  
“我今晚的航班会晚点到德国，所以是明天早上。你还住在老地方吗？”_

I nod, "Yeah I do… I'll be in all day so just… let me know when you're on your way."  
我点头，“是的，我还住那儿……我整天都在，所以……你出发时告诉我一声。”

_"I will… Thank you Asuka, I look forward to seeing you."  
"我会……谢谢你，明日香，期待与你相见。"_

"I'll see you tomorrow, goodbye Rei."  
"明天见，再见，绫波。"

As I set my phone down my hands are trembling and I take a few moments to calm myself down from talking to Rei. I take a quick drink of my coffee and look back at the e-mail, I quickly finish it off and hit send my thoughts now turning towards seeing Rei tomorrow.  
当我放下手机时，双手颤抖着，我花了几分钟时间从与绫波的对话中平静下来。我迅速喝了一口咖啡，再次看向电子邮件，我迅速完成它并点击发送，现在我的思绪转向了明天与绫波的见面。

Rei is not one of, if not the only friend I actually have. Of all the people from my past life she is the only one I actually have any contact with. A rather bizarre turnaround for anyone who might have known me back then. I can just imagine what that younger Asuka would say to think that she was friends with that same girl she considered a rival that girl that she swore she hated.  
丽就算不是我唯一的，也是我真正拥有的朋友。在我前世的所有熟人中，她是唯一一个我还保持联系的。对于任何可能认识我过去的人来说，这真是一个相当奇怪的转变。我几乎可以想象，那个年轻的明日香会怎么想，她居然和那个她视为对手、发誓讨厌的女孩成了朋友。

Of course I didn't really hate Rei back then. I hated myself but I just took that out on everyone else. It didn't matter who it was be it Shinji, Misato, Rei or even Hikari. I just ended up hurting others because I couldn't deal with who I was. That's why I'm alone now, that's why I want to stay alone and not have anyone around me because I know if I even dare to let someone in I'll hurt them and maybe just maybe in the off chance I don't… they'll find out who I was and leave me.  
当然，那时候我并没有真正讨厌丽。我讨厌的是自己，只是把这种情绪发泄到了其他人身上。无论是真嗣、美里、丽还是甚至光，我都不在乎。我最终伤害了别人，只是因为我无法接受自己。这就是为什么我现在孤身一人，这就是为什么我想保持孤独，不想让任何人靠近我，因为我知道，如果我敢让某人进入我的生活，我会伤害他们，也许有那么一丝可能我不会伤害他们……但他们会发现我过去的真面目，然后离开我。

I know I'm being stupid. Rei has told me as much when I apologized to her the last time, I think that was apology one hundred and fifty two or something. Yet it doesn't stop me from remembering and thinking all of that and I know that tomorrow I'll apologize to her again.  
我知道我这样做很愚蠢。上次我向丽道歉时，她就这么告诉过我，我想那大概是第一百五十二次道歉了吧。然而，这并不能阻止我回忆和思考这一切，我知道明天我还会再次向她道歉。

I look back at the document, I know I'll do no more work today. My thoughts are all jumbled up, I need a distraction. I'll go browse that music shop I like and maybe go and look for a new game. Something to get away from my thoughts.  
我回头看了一眼文件，知道今天不会再工作了。思绪乱成一团，我需要分散注意力。去逛逛我喜欢的音乐店，或许再找款新游戏。总得摆脱这些念头。

**Tokyo-2 – Evening 东京-2 – 傍晚**

I enter the apartment and go straight into my room to put away my cello and get changed. As I do so Misato's words continue to ring in my ears and I start to wonder what I should do next. I try to separate what it is I think other people want from me and just what it is I want to do.  
我走进公寓，径直回到房间放下大提琴，换下衣服。过程中，美里的话依旧在耳边回响，我开始思考下一步该做什么。试图区分别人对我的期望和我真正想做的事。

It's a question I ask myself quite often, it's not as if I want to be like this. I don't want to be afraid of people but I am. I don't want to just go along with others to make them happy but I do. I won't want to be in the habit of putting my own happiness to the side so that I can hear some praise from others but I can't break that habit.  
这个问题我时常自问，并非我愿意如此。我不想害怕人群，但我确实害怕。我不想仅仅为了取悦他人而随波逐流，但我却这样做了。我不想养成牺牲自己的快乐以换取他人赞扬的习惯，但我无法打破这个习惯。

The problem is even if I do try to do something for myself I start to question it. When it comes to taking lessons on the cello I wonder who am I really doing this for? Is it just something to make Misato happy, so that she can see me being out and about and doing something? Is it so that she'll say she is proud of me?  
问题是，即使我尝试为自己做些什么，我也会开始质疑。当涉及到学习大提琴的课程时，我会想，我究竟是为了谁在做这件事？是为了让美里高兴，让她看到我外出并做些什么吗？是为了让她说她为我感到骄傲吗？

I let out a sigh of frustration with myself. I know Misato would be proud of me no matter what I chose. I'm like her... well I am her son now I guess. Shortly after Third Impact she made it official, she adopted me and become my mother. I just... the way her face lit up when she suggested it... how could I have said no?  
我无奈地叹了口气。我知道无论我选择什么，美里都会为我感到骄傲。我像她一样...好吧，现在我是她的儿子了。在第三次冲击后不久，她正式收养了我，成为了我的母亲。我只是...当她提出这个建议时，她脸上的光彩...我怎么能拒绝呢？

Even the story of why I play the cello is frustrating. I only started playing it because of my teacher and guardian at the time suggesting it to me. He thought it'd be good for me to learn to play an instrument, said it'd help me develop some confidence and told me an appreciation for music is always a good thing.  
就连我为何拉大提琴的故事也令人沮丧。我之所以开始拉大提琴，只是因为当时我的老师兼监护人向我推荐了它。他认为学习乐器对我有好处，能帮助我建立自信，并告诉我欣赏音乐总是件好事。

Strangely enough when I think about it, it was actually me who picked out the cello. I can remember it quite clearly, we were in the music shop and looking at the variety of instruments. Drums, guitars, piano, violins and so much more. Something about the cello appealed to me though. The shopkeeper gave us a demonstration and I just... I become attached to it. I took lessons and it did make my teacher happy that I was doing something.  
奇怪的是，当我回想起来，实际上是我自己选择了大提琴。我记得很清楚，当时我们在乐器店里，看着各种各样的乐器。鼓、吉他、钢琴、小提琴等等。但不知为何，大提琴吸引了我。店主为我们演示了一番，我...我就对它产生了依恋。我上了课，这让我的老师很高兴，因为我有所行动。

I did enjoying playing it though. I know deep down I wasn't just doing it for him but because I wanted to. I liked it and yes, I did want him to be proud of me and say that but I liked playing. I liked the way I could lose myself in what I was playing. I liked exploring the range of music composed for it and even trying to compose my own.  
不过，我的确喜欢拉大提琴。我知道我内心深处不仅仅是为了他，而是因为我自己想拉。我喜欢它，是的，我希望他能为我感到骄傲，说出来，但我喜欢拉琴本身。我喜欢沉浸在自己演奏的音乐中。我喜欢探索为大提琴创作的音乐范围，甚至尝试自己作曲。

I let out another sigh as I sit on the edge of my bed. I look down at the cello and go back to thinking about the lesson. My instructor had been a nice man. He was a lot younger than I expected. He did actually tell me that he also worked with a number of students and that I would fit right in. I couldn't help myself but say yes as soon as he asked if I'd be interested.  
我坐在床边，又叹了口气。低头看着大提琴，思绪又回到了那堂课上。我的老师是个好人，比我想象中年轻许多。他确实告诉我，他带过不少学生，我加入正合适。他一问我对这事儿感不感兴趣，我就忍不住答应了。

I couldn't help myself but he seemed so happy and enthusiastic about it and he offered praise. I'm like some dumb moth crashing into a lightbulb. I know I'm not ready for that sort of thing yet, I'm too scared to meet other people but I can't really explain that to him. How can I explain that I'm part of the reason Third Impact happened and that now everyone terrifies me?  
我情不自禁，他看起来那么开心和热情，还给予了我赞扬。我就像只愚蠢的飞蛾，一头撞向灯泡。我知道自己还没准备好面对这些，我害怕见其他人，但又无法向他解释。我怎么能告诉他，我是第三次冲击发生的原因之一，现在每个人都让我感到恐惧呢？

The worst thing about it is that deep down if it wasn't the fear of it I do want to do that. I want to be part of that group and I want to play cello with them. I want to be part of productions with audiences coming to see us play and I want to write and compose but I'm too damn messed up to admit or do anything about it.  
最糟糕的是，内心深处，如果不是因为恐惧，我确实想这么做。我想成为那个团队的一员，想和他们一起拉大提琴。我想参与有观众来观看的演出，想创作和作曲，但我太混乱了，无法承认或采取任何行动。

I just wish I could move forward! Every day since Third Impact has been some stupid struggle and I'm sick of it. I'm fed up of being afraid of people. I'm fed up of knowing I have no reason to be. I'm sick of having those old feelings of uselessness or feeling that people are going to abandon me. It isn't fair, none of it is fair! I just... I just want to be happy, don't I deserve that?  
我真希望能向前迈进！自从第三次冲击以来，每一天都是些愚蠢的挣扎，我受够了。我厌倦了对人们感到恐惧。我厌倦了明知自己没有理由这样。我厌倦了那些无用感或觉得人们会抛弃我的旧情绪。这不公平，这一切都不公平！我只是……我只是想快乐，难道我不配吗？

I can't help but shake my head sympathetically as I watch Shinji slip into his room and close the door behind him. I take this chance to go into my own room so that I can get changed into something more comfortable.  
我不禁同情地摇了摇头，看着真嗣溜进自己的房间并关上门。我趁机回到自己的房间，以便换上更舒适的衣服。

These past few years have been tough for those of us who were at the center of what happened. I know it's been especially tough on Shinji though. I can't even begin to imagine just what it is he is going through. He literally had the fate of the world in his hands at one point and for a brief few seconds it almost went. God only knows what it must feel like to be him.  
过去几年对我们这些身处事件中心的人来说很艰难。我知道这对真嗣尤其艰难。我甚至无法想象他正在经历什么。他曾一度掌握着世界的命运，有那么几秒钟几乎要失败了。只有上帝知道他是什么感觉。

Shinji has made some progress over the years though. We suffered a slight setback when Asuka left. He was heartbroken to see her go but it wasn't entirely unexpected. Yet it was a shame, I had hoped that maybe they would realize their feelings for each other and something would happen. Still maybe it was for the best, maybe the chance for them to be apart and find themselves will help them more. I just wish she hadn't cut off contact completely from us all. I'm sure she is alright but I don't know where she is now or anything.  
这些年，真嗣确实有了些进步。但当明日香离开时，我们遭遇了小小的挫折。看到她离去，他心碎了，虽然这并非完全出乎意料。可惜的是，我曾希望他们能意识到彼此的感情，或许会发生些什么。不过，也许这样最好，让他们分开并找到自我，可能会更有帮助。我只希望她没有完全切断与我们所有人的联系。我确信她没事，只是不知道她现在在哪里。

Shinji did seem to get over it eventually though. I don't know if he still thinks of her, I imagine he does. We talk about her from time to time, wonder what she is up to and if she is alright. I'm careful to not tease him about her. I enjoy a joke but I've come to realize that there are some jokes that shouldn't be made.  
不过，真嗣最终似乎还是走出来了。我不知道他是否还会想起她，我猜他会。我们偶尔会谈论她，想知道她在做什么，是否安好。我小心地不拿她来取笑他。我喜欢开玩笑，但我逐渐意识到有些玩笑是不该开的。

As I slip my suit jacket off I hear my phone start to ring. I let out a laugh as I pick it up and see Ritsuko's name on the caller ID, right on cue Rits.  
当我脱下西装外套时，听到手机开始响了。我笑着拿起手机，看到是律子打来的，真是准时啊，律子。

"Hey Rits! Calling to check in on us, are you?"  
"嘿，Rits！打电话来关心我们，是吗？"

I hear her let out a laugh on the other end, _"I just wanted to make you didn't blow your big meeting today, I know it was an important one."_  
我听到她在电话那头笑出声来，“我只是想确认你今天的大会没搞砸，我知道那很重要。”

She can't see me but I pout, "You have that little faith in me huh?"  
她看不见我，但我还是撅起了嘴，“你就这么不相信我啊？”

_"Actually I have complete faith in you which is why I know I can make a joke about it. So how did it go?"  
“实际上，我对你完全有信心，所以我才敢开这个玩笑。那么，情况如何？”_

I shrug, "About as well as could be expected for a first meeting on this sort of subject. A lot of people introducing themselves and telling us why they're important. A lot of discussion about the objectives on the meeting followed by setting estimated dates on when objectives should be confirmed by. This was followed up by discussing the arranging of further meetings between different departments to confirm more dates for meetings. A load of bureaucratic bullshit really."  
我耸耸肩，“第一次在这种话题上见面，情况还算符合预期。很多人自我介绍，告诉我们他们为什么重要。会议目标讨论了很多，然后设定了确认目标的预计日期。接着讨论了安排不同部门之间进一步会议以确认更多会议日期的事宜。基本上就是一堆官僚主义的废话。”

She lets out a chuckle, _"So no word on whether or not you guys will be allowed into Tokyo-3 or what will happen to the Emergence Facilities?"_  
她轻笑一声，“那么，关于你们是否能进入东京-3，或者紧急设施会发生什么，还没有消息吗？”

"Nope, nothing yet. It seems we have some competition when it comes to wanting to go back into Tokyo-3. Each one has different goals. Some want to do a full sweep, take as much technology from NERV that they can and build from it. Some think that they should go in, take what they can and destroy it all. Reuse the land for housing or whatever. We're somewhere in the middle."  
"不，还没有动静。看来我们在重返第三新东京市这件事上遇到了一些竞争。每个人的目标都不尽相同。有些人想要彻底搜刮一番，尽可能从 NERV 那里获取技术，并在此基础上发展。有些人则认为应该进去，能拿多少拿多少，然后将其全部摧毁。将土地重新用于住宅或其他用途。我们则处于两者之间。"

_"Well that's surprising, I'd have thought you'd want to see the entire thing destroyed."  
"这倒是挺意外的，我本以为你会希望看到整个设施被彻底摧毁。"_

I shrug, "Initially I did but after talking with Maya and some of the others they persuaded me that some of it might be of use to us. We had some pretty advanced technology and it'd be a shame for it to go to waste if we can help people. Also in the back of my mind I keep thinking… what if… well…"  
我耸耸肩，"起初我确实这么想，但和真希波以及其他一些人交谈后，他们说服了我，认为其中一些技术或许对我们有用。我们拥有相当先进的技术，如果能够帮助人们，让它白白浪费就太可惜了。而且在我内心深处，我一直在想……万一……嗯……"

_"They're gone Misato, there won't be anymore_." He voice comes through loud and clear and is in a very stern tone, _"The Angels, SEELE… it's done."_  
"他们已经消失了，美里，不会再有了。" 他的声音清晰而严厉，"使徒，SEELE……一切都结束了。"

I let out a sigh, I know she is right of course but I still feel a need to say something, "I know that but… say someone tries to carry on the things they did or… I don't know we messed something up and an Angel like thing appears. Maybe… just maybe having some of the heavier stuff around would be useful."  
我叹了口气，我知道她是对的，但我仍然觉得需要说些什么，"我知道，但是……如果有人试图继续他们所做的事情，或者……我不知道我们搞砸了什么，然后出现了类似使徒的东西。也许……只是也许，保留一些重型装备会有用。"

_"And how exactly would you define what is or isn't the right sort of stuff? It's one thing when it might benefit mankind, you're right our medical tech was far beyond what we have now as was our energy production tech but the military stuff… the Eva's…"  
"那你究竟如何定义什么是或不是合适的装备呢？当它可能造福人类时，你是对的，我们的医疗技术远超现在，能源生产技术也是如此，但军事装备……EVA……"_

"I know…" "我知道……"

_"Do you want my opinion?"  
"你想听我的意见吗？"_

"Always." "一直都想。"

_"Destroy the lot of it Misato, get rid of it all and use the land for something else. The medical tech… the energy production all relied on what we got from the FAR. Keep the Emergence Support facilities open and just let NERV and SEELE go, what happened… it can't happen again, what they need is gone so we should just get rid of the rest."  
“全部摧毁吧，美里，把它们都清除掉，用这块地做点别的。那些医疗技术……能源生产全都依赖我们从 FAR 获得的东西。保持紧急支援设施开放，让 NERV 和 SEELE 就这样消失，发生过的事……不能再重演，他们所需的一切已不复存在，所以我们应该把剩下的也一并清除。”_

"Destroy everything?" I ask in surprise, "Even the MAGI there?"  
“全部摧毁？”我惊讶地问，“连那里的 MAGI 系统也包括在内吗？”

_"Especially the Tokyo-3 MAGI, if there is anything left of it." She replies, "That's… what I'd do anyway."  
“尤其是第三新东京市的 MAGI，如果它还有什么残留的话。”她回答道，“无论如何，这是我……会采取的做法。”_

"I don't know… if I could do that. The medical tech… it could help a lot of people…"  
"我不知道……我能否做到。这项医疗技术……它可以帮助很多人……"

_"I know and that's why you're the one who'll make the decision Misato and not me. You… always knew the right way to do things."  
"我明白，这也是为什么由美里你来做决定，而不是我。你……总是知道正确的方法。"_

I smile faintly at hearing her words, "We'll see what happens when it's all documented. It could be that there is nothing of use there at all. It's been years since anyone actually went into the ruins but… I think it's worth looking at and I think it should be my people."  
听到她的话，我微微一笑，"我们会看到一切被记录下来后的结果。可能那里根本没有什么有用的东西。已经很多年没有人真正进入过那些废墟了，但是……我认为值得一看，而且我认为应该由我的人去。"

_"I'm sure it will be."_ She pauses for a moment, _"So how did things go for Shinji anyway?"_  
"我相信会的。" 她顿了一下，"那么，真嗣那边情况怎么样？"

Another sigh escapes me, "I think they went well. He seemed to enjoy the lesson but…"  
我又叹了口气，"我觉得挺好的。他看起来挺喜欢这堂课的，但是……"

_"He was scared of being recognized?"  
"他害怕被认出来吗？"_

"Yeah…" I confirm to her.  
"是啊…" 我向她确认道。

_"That's understandable, I think it's something we're all dealing with in our own way."  
"这可以理解，我想这是我们都在以自己的方式应对的事情。"_

"I'm just worried about him Rits. I don't want him to feel like he has to do this for me or for anyone else I want him to do it for himself not because I said it might be a good idea."  
"我只是担心他，Rits。我不希望他觉得必须为了我或任何人去做这件事，我希望他是为了自己，而不是因为我提过这可能是个好主意。"

_"It's entirely possible that Shinji doesn't even know himself."_ Ritsuko says, _"He probably wants to make you happy but he also enjoys playing the instrument. Our reports on him indicated that he was a natural talent with it and his teacher even said that Shinji would spend a lot of time practicing when he was younger."_  
“完全有可能真嗣自己都不清楚。” 律子说道，“他可能想让你开心，但他也喜欢弹奏乐器。我们的报告指出他在音乐方面天赋异禀，连他的老师都说真嗣小时候会花很多时间练习。”

Hearing her say that lightens my heart somewhat, "So he does enjoy it?"  
听到她这么说，我心里稍微轻松了些，“所以他确实喜欢弹奏？”

Ritsuko chuckles, "_I don't think you get to be the level Shinji was at without enjoying it. Just give him time and encouragement. I'm sure he'll figure things out for himself. He said the lesson went alright though?"_  
律子轻笑道，“我不认为能达到真嗣那样的水平会不喜欢。给他一些时间和鼓励，我相信他自己会想明白的。他说课上得还不错，对吧？”

"Yeah." I nod my head, "Well… He did mention that the instructor suggested at one point that Shinji join a group of them who all play."  
"嗯。" 我点点头，"呃… 他确实提到过，教练曾建议他加入一个他们一起玩的团队。"

_"And Shinji immediately said yes didn't he?"_ Ritsuko asks with some hint of amusement in her voice.  
"然后真嗣立刻就答应了，对吧？" 律子带着一丝戏谑的语气问道。"

"Of course." I confirm to her, "He didn't want to disappoint his instructor."  
"当然。" 我向她确认，"他不想让教练失望。"

_"Well that's just a part of who Shinji is. Maybe it'll be good for him in the long run though, he can always stop if it's too much."  
"嗯，那只是真嗣性格的一部分。不过从长远来看，这对他也许是件好事，如果感到太过沉重，他随时可以停下来。"_

"Maybe… I just don't want him to get hurt or feel he has to do things to please others. I want him to know he has a loving home and friends who won't abandon him."  
"也许吧……我只是不想让他受伤，或者觉得必须做些什么来取悦别人。我希望他知道，他有一个充满爱的家和不会抛弃他的朋友。"

_"Deep down he will know that but it's not exactly easy to break those old habits. It's something I think we're all learning but I'm sure he'll be alright."  
"他内心深处会明白的，但打破那些旧习惯并不容易。我认为我们都在学习这一点，但我确信他会没事的。"_

"I hope so… I really do." I stare down at the ground, "So how was your day anyway?"  
"我也希望如此……我真的这么希望。" 我低头盯着地面，"那么，你今天过得怎么样？"

_"Not too bad, I have a lot of marking to do this evening and I need to plan for next week's lessons but nothing I can't do. Still… if I'm being honest I do understand what Shinji is going through. I keep on thinking when I see the students and their parents that maybe one of them will recognize me… It's not as if the Akagi name is hidden away."  
"还不错，今晚我有很多批改作业的工作要做，还得为下周的课做准备，不过这些我都能应付。尽管如此……说实话，我确实理解真嗣正在经历的事情。每次看到学生和他们的家长，我都会想，也许他们会认出我来……毕竟，赤木这个姓氏并不是什么秘密。"_

I nod again, "I know… It's the same for Katsuragi. I have that feeling too from time to time but it won't happen."  
我再次点头，"我知道……对于葛城也是一样。我有时也会有那种感觉，但那不会发生的。"

_"No it won't."_ She reassures me, _"Anyway I'd better go. Maya is due back any minute. Good luck to the both of you. We should arrange something soon."_  
"不，不会的。" 她安慰我，"无论如何，我最好走了。玛雅随时可能回来。祝你们俩好运。我们应该尽快安排点什么。"

"Yeah… I'd like that. Goodbye Rits."  
"是啊……我很期待。再见，立夏。"

I can't suppress the smile on my face as I glance down at the forms in my hand once more and walk through the wonderful streets of Berlin. It's been almost six months since I arrived in this country and this city I now call home.  
当我再次低头看着手中的表格，走在柏林美丽的街道上，我无法抑制脸上的笑容。自从我来到这个国家，这座我现在称之为家的城市，已经快六个月了。

Most of my time is spent working for Fuyutsuki. I assist him in an array of administrative tasks from filing basic progress reports for his staff, taking notes during meetings he is in, I arrange appointments for him and compose e-mails for him. It's not overly difficult work but I enjoy it.  
我的大部分时间都花在为冬月先生工作上。我协助他处理一系列行政事务，从为他手下员工整理基本进度报告，到在他参加会议时做笔记，我还为他安排预约并代写电子邮件。这份工作并不特别困难，但我乐在其中。

Since I arrived Fuyutsuki has been careful to slowly educate me on the state of this world since I was last in it. He explained to me exactly what has happened since the Third Impact and the little ways in which the world has changed. He told me what it was he now did and also informed me of the status of organizations such as NERV and the group who handled me, SEELE.  
自从我来到这里，冬月先生一直小心翼翼地逐步向我介绍自上次我离开后这个世界的变化。他详细地向我解释了第三次冲击以来发生的一切，以及世界在细微之处发生的改变。他告诉我他现在的工作，并告知我诸如 NERV 和负责我的组织 SEELE 等机构的状态。

It seems that after Third Impact and people returned information was released to the public and world governments about SEELE and their role in the whole thing. Names were kept away from the public eye but it was enough that the world knew the truth about who was the true enemy. If anything I was pleased to learn that the people who were a part of NERV were alive and well.  
似乎在第三次冲击之后，随着人们回归，有关 SEELE 及其在整个事件中角色的信息被公开给公众和世界各国政府。虽然具体姓名未被公开，但足以让世界知道谁是真正的敌人。令我欣慰的是，我得知参与 NERV 的人们都安然无恙。

There are certain subjects I have dared to not ask about as of yet. These particular things have been the subject of numerous nightmares I've experienced since returning. I dare not ask what happened to Shinji Ikari, Rei Ayanami or even the other pilot who was there in my short stay. I assume from what Fuyutsuki told me about former NERV personnel being alive and well that they are okay but I don't dare go any deeper than that.  
有些话题我至今未敢触及。自从归来后，这些特定的事情就成了我无数噩梦的主题。我不敢询问真嗣·碇、绫波零，甚至是我在短暂停留期间见过的那位驾驶员发生了什么。我从冬月那里得知前 NERV 人员都安然无恙，所以我推测他们应该没事，但我并不敢深入探究。

Maybe… Maybe one day I'll work up the nerve to find out but not until I know I'm ready for it. I'm still trying to adjust to this life, one I didn't think I'd ever have. I've been given a gift, a chance to explore so many things I never knew before.  
也许……也许有一天我会鼓起勇气去了解，但前提是我确定自己已经准备好了。我仍在努力适应这种生活，一种我从未想过会拥有的生活。我被赋予了一份礼物，一个探索我以前从未知晓的众多事物的机会。

Music had of course been my first port of call. I've been able to explore numerous eras and genres beyond the classical material they forced me to listen to. The playlist Kodama gave me was a huge benefit. I took notes of each artist to listen to moments and pieces I enjoyed. It seems she put a lot of work into making that playlist, managing to cover a variety of genres, eras, artists from around the world.  
音乐自然成了我的首选。我得以探索众多时代和流派，超越了他们强迫我听的古典音乐。儿玉给我的播放列表带来了巨大的帮助。我记录了每个艺术家，以便聆听我喜欢的时刻和作品。看来她在这份播放列表上下了很多功夫，成功涵盖了世界各地的各种流派、时代和艺术家。

With my background in classical music and playing the piano I did find myself drawn towards the progressive genres of rock. I enjoy the longer tracks and slightly complex arrangements these songs offer. I also like how they made a habit of utilizing a wide array of instruments in their songs although admittedly they could be a bit obtuse lyrically although I suppose knowing the way I speak is probably another reason that the genre appeals to me.  
我自幼学习古典音乐并弹奏钢琴，因此对摇滚乐中的前卫流派情有独钟。我喜欢这些歌曲提供的较长曲目和略显复杂的编排。我也欣赏他们在歌曲中广泛运用各种乐器的习惯，尽管不可否认，歌词有时可能略显晦涩，但我想，这或许也是该流派吸引我的另一个原因，毕竟我的言谈方式也与之相仿。

Beyond that I have found I don't have much of an affinity for sports. I appreciate what various athletes and sports stars are capable of, I just don't really enjoy watching them. In fact I don't find myself watching much television at all nor have I had the chance to see a movie in a theater yet. I would like to but I don't know what it is I would watch.  
除此之外，我发现我对体育并没有太多兴趣。我虽然敬佩各类运动员和体育明星的才能，但并不热衷于观看他们的比赛。事实上，我很少看电视，也从未有机会在影院观看电影。我希望能有机会，但不知该选择什么影片。

I have also found that I quite enjoy the human act of cooking too. In my previous life I did not get an opportunity to partake of this particular pastime. As an Angel I didn't require as much food as a regular human would and being under the care of SEELE meant any meals were carefully monitored and structured to provide what my body needed. It was usually bland and functional,  
我还发现，我非常享受烹饪这一人类活动。在前世，我未曾有机会体验这一爱好。作为天使，我不需要像普通人那样进食，而 SEELE 的照料意味着我的每一餐都经过精心监控和安排，以满足身体所需。那些食物通常平淡无味，仅具功能性，

Unfortunately learning to cook came with some dangers. There had been one incident involving an errant pan and my apartment nearly burning down and another in which some undercooked meat had given me a night I don't wish to experience ever again. Yet I suppose it is a part of the learning process, I will not be the first nor the last to under-prepare meat like that.  
不幸的是，学习烹饪伴随着一些危险。曾有一次，一个失控的平底锅差点让我的公寓化为灰烬，还有一次，未煮熟的肉让我经历了一夜，我再也不想体验。然而，我想这是学习过程的一部分，我不会是第一个也不会是最后一个那样准备不足的人。

I turn onto another street and see a small coffee shop come into view. I decide that it would be a shame to go straight back to my apartment now and this place looks appealing so think it'd be a good idea to head inside and grab something to drink and relax. I clutch the forms I'm holding tightly in my hand and walk down the street.  
我拐进另一条街道，看到一家小咖啡馆映入眼帘。我觉得现在直接回公寓太可惜了，这家店看起来很吸引人，所以我认为进去喝点东西放松一下是个好主意。我紧紧抓着手里拿着的表格，沿着街道走去。

The forms I'm holding are application forms to help me on my first step towards become a music teacher. Fuyutsuki had given me the idea a few weeks ago after hearing me play the piano. He had at first suggested I find overs to play with but admittedly I do not think I would mix well with a group at this time and being honest being in larger groups scares me somewhat.  
我手里拿着的是成为音乐教师的第一步所需的申请表。几周前，冬月给了我这个建议，当时他听我弹钢琴。他起初建议我找人一起演奏，但老实说，我不认为自己现在能很好地融入一个团体，而且说实话，大型团体让我有些害怕。

Yet the more I thought about it the more I realized that one on one situations might be better suited to me and I would like, if anything, to share what I have and maybe inspire others. Fuyutsuki liked my idea and helped me find a means to getting the correct qualifications.  
然而，我越是思考，越意识到一对一的情况可能更适合我，我希望能分享我所拥有的，或许还能激励他人。冬月喜欢我的想法，并帮助我找到了获得正确资格的途径。

I look at the forms again, there are still a few things to fill out on there. My name and address are at the top but there are other questions on there. How long have I been playing? My inspirations and prior qualifications. Nothing complex but I'm very eager to fill it in and get this all started.  
我又看了看表格，还有一些地方需要填写。我的名字和地址在顶部，但还有其他问题。我玩了多久？我的灵感来源和之前的资格。虽然不复杂，但我非常渴望填写并开始这一切。

I continue to walk forward my eyes still focused on the paper until finally I hit something, not something but someone. I feel a sharp pain in my head as I connect with them, I hear a loud scream from them as I'm sent falling onto my backside and the form flies out of my hand.  
我继续前行，眼睛仍紧盯着那张纸，直到最终撞上了什么，不是东西，而是某个人。我感到头部一阵剧痛，随着与他们的碰撞，我听到一声尖叫，自己被撞倒在地，表格也从手中飞了出去。

I rub my head with my hand and hear an angry voice yell at me, "Idiot! Weren't you watching where you were going?"  
我用手揉着头，听到一个愤怒的声音对我吼道：“白痴！你没看路吗？”

I shake my head and my vision starts to come back to me, the pain however does not subside, "I apologize… are you hurt?"  
我摇了摇头，视线开始恢复，但疼痛并未减轻，“对不起……你受伤了吗？”

I slowly start to get to my feet and hold out a hand to help the fallen girl to her feet.  
我慢慢站起身，伸出一只手帮助那位摔倒的女孩站起来。

"Yeah well… just be more careful! Could have broken something!" She remarks as she gets to her feet and picks up a small laptop bag she dropped. I take a step back and for the first time I actually see the girl I walked into.  
"哎，好吧……小心点！差点就弄坏了什么东西！" 她一边说，一边站起身来，捡起她掉落的小笔记本包。我后退一步，第一次真正看清了那个我撞到的女孩。

Almost immediately I feel my eyes get wide with fear. I feel that sickly feeling in the pit of my stomach as I take in all of her features. Her shoulder length red hair, her bright blue eyes, a soft but angered expression and a thin scar over her left eye. She's older than I remember seeing her but there is no mistaking who this is.  
几乎立刻，我感到恐惧让我的眼睛瞪大。我感受到胃里那种恶心的感觉，当我注意到她所有的特征时。她齐肩的红发，明亮的蓝眼睛，柔和但带着怒意的表情，以及左眼上方的一道细疤。她比我记忆中看到的要年长，但毫无疑问，这就是她。

"N-No…" I stutter, "I-Impossible…"  
"不-不可能……" 我结巴着说，"这-这不可能……"

She looks at me in confusion, "What? Never saw a pissed off redhead before?"  
她困惑地看着我，“什么？没见过生气的红发女孩吗？”

I shake my head, "N-No… I…I'm sorry… I have to go!"  
我摇摇头，“不，不……我……我很抱歉……我得走了！”

I immediately turn around and run away from her as fast as I can. I don't stop to look back at any point until I'm several streets away. I don't know if she called after me or if she recognizes me, all I know is I have to get away from her. I have to get away from Asuka Langley Soryu, The Second Child.  
我立刻转身，尽可能快地逃离她。直到跑过几条街，我都没有回头看一眼。我不知道她是否在后面叫我，或者是否认出了我，我只知道我必须远离她。我必须远离明日香·兰格雷，第二适格者。

### Chapter 3: Lost Boy  
第三章：迷失的男孩  

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

**Berlin – Early Morning 柏林 – 清晨时分**

The nightmares came back last night. The ones in which I get found out, the ones in which the fragile social bonds I've made with people are shattered and everyone turns there back on me. The ones where I wake up crying knowing that if that did happen I'd deserve it.  
昨晚噩梦又回来了。那些梦里我被揭穿，那些梦里我与人建立的脆弱社交关系被粉碎，每个人都背弃我。那些梦里我哭着醒来，知道如果真发生了那种事，我活该。

I didn't sleep for the rest of the night, from four o'clock onwards I've been awake sitting in my front room. I tried doing some further editing to my book, that didn't happen so instead I put on a game instead. I spent the majority of the morning scoring goals past any and all opposition as I try to put what happened yesterday out of my mind.  
那一夜我再也没睡，从四点开始就一直醒着坐在客厅。我试着继续编辑我的书，但没做成，于是改玩起了游戏。整个早上我大部分时间都在攻破所有对手的防线，试图把昨天发生的事抛诸脑后。

Why did he run away from me like that? Did he know who I was? Does he know what I did? That shouldn't be possible though, I know logically it shouldn't be possible. I've spoken about it with Rei in the past, He... he has the same concerns but no one knows who we are. If they do they just know we were the Evangelion pilots who helped save the world.  
他为什么那样从我身边逃开？他知道我是谁吗？他知道我做过什么吗？这按理说不应该啊，我理智上知道这不应该。我以前和丽讨论过，他……他也有同样的担忧，但没人知道我们是谁。如果他们知道，也只晓得我们是帮助拯救世界的 EVA 驾驶员。

Yet that annoying awkward fear remains. It doesn't help that I'm seeing Rei today either. It isn't her fault, I know she is my friend but I can't help but worry each time I see her that it will be the time that our friendship is revealed to be nothing but a fraud. That she comes here with the others to tell me how much they hate me. To tell me how disgusting I am and that I deserve to be alone and abandoned. To bring up all those things I did in my past and throw it in my face. I'd deserve it aswell wouldn't I?  
然而那种恼人的尴尬恐惧依旧挥之不去。今天还要见丽，这更让我不安。我知道这不是她的错，她是我朋友，但我每次见她都不禁担心，我们的友谊会不会被揭穿只是个骗局。她会不会和其他人一起来告诉我他们有多恨我，告诉我我有多恶心，活该孤独被抛弃。会不会把我过去的所作所为都翻出来，甩在我脸上。我也该受这些，不是吗？

I shake my head and force those thoughts away. That isn't going to happen, Rei is my friend now and everything is in the past. She's told me numerous times, even with some annoyance that I'm forgiven for how I acted back then.  
我摇摇头，强迫自己抛开这些念头。不会发生的，丽现在是我的朋友，一切都过去了。她多次甚至有些不耐烦地告诉我，我当时的所作所为她已经原谅了。

It's all that guys fault, if he hadn't had ran away then I wouldn't be like this right now. No, that isn't true. I'd be like this anyway, he's just made it more prominent. I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror, I look rough. I can see the bags under my eyes and I know no amount of make-up will hide them. I've tried to make an effort but I know Rei will see through it. She always does, it's who Rei is.  
都怪那家伙，如果不是他逃走了，我现在就不会这样。不，这不是真的。无论如何我都会这样，他只是让这一切更加明显了。我从镜子里瞥了自己一眼，看起来很憔悴。眼下的黑眼圈清晰可见，我知道再多的化妆品也遮不住。我试着打扮了一下，但我知道丽会看穿这一切。她总是能看穿，这就是丽。

I finally open the door ao reveal Rei standing on the other side. She's a far cry from the dour girl I knew so many years ago. She's looking upwards, a faint smile on her face and wearing a short red skirt, complemented by a black top with a white jacket over it. In one of her hands is a bag that I recognize from one of the nearby cafes.  
我终于打开门，露出站在另一边的丽。她与我多年前认识的那个阴郁女孩相去甚远。她抬头望向天空，脸上带着淡淡的微笑，穿着一条红色短裙，搭配黑色上衣和白色夹克。她手中提着一个袋子，我认出那是附近一家咖啡馆的。

"Hello Asuka." She announces, "I brought lunch if that is alright?"  
“你好，明日香。”她宣布道，“我带了午餐，可以吗？”

I laugh and step aside to let her in, "Of course, come on in!"  
我笑着侧身让她进来，“当然可以，快请进！”

I watch her as she enters the apartment and I allow myself a smile as well. I feel happy to see the life that now exists within Rei. It's good to see she finally has the chance to have a life. I follow her through into the kitchen and watch as she places the bag up on one of the counters. I'm interested in seeing what it is she has bought, moments later she pulls out two boxes each one filled with luscious smelling pancakes.  
我看着她走进公寓，也忍不住微笑起来。看到丽现在有了生活的气息，我感到很高兴。很高兴她终于有机会过上自己的生活。我跟着她走进厨房，看着她把袋子放在其中一个台面上。我很好奇她买了什么，不一会儿，她从袋子里拿出两个盒子，每个盒子里都装满了香气扑鼻的煎饼。

My mouth starts to water at the sight of them and I step forward. Rei sees this and smiles and immediately turns herself around and pulls me into a warm but tight hug.  
看到这些煎饼，我的口水开始分泌，我向前迈了一步。丽看到了，微笑着立刻转过身来，给了我一个温暖而紧实的拥抱。

"I've missed you Asuka!" “我好想你，明日香！”

I laugh and return the hug, "I've miss you too Rei, it's been quite a while hasn't it?"  
我笑着回抱她，“我也想你，丽，真是好久不见了，对吧？”

She releases me from the hug, "Almost a year since we last met."  
她松开拥抱，“我们上次见面差不多快一年了。”

"Yeah." I say guiltily, "How was your flight?"  
“是啊。”我内疚地说，“你的航班怎么样？”

She shrugs slightly, "It was okay. I arrived late last night so I was able to get a good amount of sleep."  
她微微耸肩，“还不错。我昨晚很晚才到，所以睡了个好觉。”

"I'm glad." I reply as I go into one of my kitchen cupboards to grab some plates for our pancakes, "These smell delicious Rei."  
“那就好。”我一边回答，一边走进厨房打开橱柜拿盘子准备装我们的煎饼，“这些闻起来真香，丽。”

"They do, I was wondering what to do for lunch and saw a place selling these. I have become quite a fan of pancakes whilst being in America, I am eager to try these."  
“确实很香，我正想着午餐吃什么，就看到有地方卖这个。在美国这段时间，我成了煎饼的忠实粉丝，很期待尝试这些。”

I am as well and I get out some plates and cutlery for us. The pancakes are plain but the café Rei got them from supplied her with a variety of spreads to try with them. Rei reaches for the strawberry jam for hers, I go for the classic chocolate spread for my first one.  
我也一样，于是我拿出一些盘子和餐具为我们准备。这些煎饼是原味的，但 Rei 买它们的咖啡店提供了多种酱料供我们尝试。Rei 选择了草莓酱，而我则选择了经典的巧克力酱作为我的第一份。

"So how come you're here in Germany, I thought the plan was to travel America for a few more weeks?"  
“那么你怎么会来德国呢？我记得计划是还要在美国旅行几周的？”

"it was but I realized halfway through the trip that it was coming up to a year since I last saw you, so I sought to rectify that."  
“确实如此，但我在旅途中途意识到，自从上次见你已经快一年了，所以我决定来弥补这一点。”

I almost choke in shock, "Y-You... Rei that's too much money just to come and visit me!"  
我几乎被惊得噎住，“你...丽，这钱太多了，就为了来看我！”

She shrugs again, "I do not think so. As I said it has almost been a year and I think the chances of you visiting me and Japan are somewhat slim."  
她又耸了耸肩，“我不这么认为。正如我所说，已经快一年了，我觉得你来日本看我的可能性相当渺茫。”

That little pang of guilt I feel at hearing her say that is suppressed for a moment by me swallowing a bit of my pancake. I gave down at the counter, "Yeah well... You know why that is Rei."  
听到她这么说，我心中那丝愧疚感被咽下的一口煎饼暂时压了下去。我低头看着柜台，“是啊，好吧...丽，你知道为什么的。”

"Yes. Although I must disagree with your stance, I am sure they would like to see you again."  
"是的。虽然我不同意你的立场，但我确信他们希望再次见到你。"

"No Rei... They wouldn't like to see me." I look up at her and let out a sigh, "Look, it's... it isn't that I don't believe you it's just that... I can't see them again and that's for the best. I hurt them a lot and it's just best I stay away. They... They're better off without me in their life, I'm not a good person."  
"不，丽...他们不会想见我的。" 我抬头看着她，叹了口气，"听着，不是我不相信你，只是...我不能再见到他们，这样最好。我伤害了他们很多，最好还是保持距离。他们...没有我在他们的生活中会更好，我不是个好人。"

"I do not become friends with bad people Asuka."  
"我不会和坏人交朋友的，明日香。"

I feel my cheeks glow red, "Yeah well... maybe I'm the exception to the rule."  
"我感觉脸颊发烫，红了起来，“嗯，好吧……也许我就是那个例外。””

"I do not believe so, I believe you are being too hard on yourself."  
“我不这么认为，我觉得你对自己太苛刻了。”

I shrug, "Maybe... Maybe not... I guess... they still don't know that we're friends do they?"  
“我耸耸肩，“也许吧……也许不是……我想……他们还不知道我们是朋友，对吧？””

"I have not told them anything of our friendship and I will continue to keep this a secret for as long as you desire it. As far as they are concerned you left Japan years ago and are living comfortably and off the grid."  
"我并未向他们透露我们之间的友谊，只要你希望，我会继续保守这个秘密。在他们看来，你多年前就离开了日本，过着舒适且隐居的生活。"

"T-Thank you, I'm sorry I am making you keep this a secret."  
"谢-谢谢你，很抱歉让你替我保守这个秘密。"

"I do not mind." She replies coolly, "That is what you wish and as your friend I will not betray that wish."  
"我并不介意。" 她冷静地回答，"这是你的愿望，作为你的朋友，我不会辜负这份心愿。"

"Thank you." I nervously shift from one foot to the other, "So... how are they doing?"  
"谢谢。" 我紧张地左右脚换着重心，"那么...他们现在怎么样？"

"Misato has begun work with an organization known as WILLE. I believe that she wishes to start operations in Tokyo-3 to salvage what is left of NERV."  
"美里已经开始在一个名为 WILLE 的组织工作。我相信她希望在第三新东京市启动行动，以挽救 NERV 剩余的部分。"

Another pang in my stomach at hearing the name of NERV spoken, I quickly supress it with another chocolate covered piece of pancake. I'm nearly done with this one, I should get another. Maybe not chocolate spread this time, I might try the jam, Rei seemed to enjoy that one.  
听到 NERV 这个名字，我的胃又是一阵抽痛，我迅速用另一块裹着巧克力的煎饼压下这种感觉。这块快吃完了，我应该再拿一块。也许这次不要巧克力酱了，我可能会试试果酱，丽似乎挺喜欢那个的。

"is there even anything left to recover?" I ask, "I mean... we didn't exactly leave it in a reusable state."  
"还有什么可恢复的吗？" 我问道，"我的意思是...我们并没有让它保持在一个可再利用的状态。"

Rei nods, "NERV was much bigger than any of you... even I knew. There are parts of it that will still be there and might have something of benefit to us... or something that should be destroyed. I trust that Misato will make the right decision."  
丽点头道，"NERV 比你们任何人...甚至我都知道的还要庞大。它的一些部分仍然存在，可能对我们有益...或者有些东西应该被摧毁。我相信美里会做出正确的决定。"

"Hah, making the right decision and Misato?" I start to joke but trail off, Rei seems amused but halfway through I realize the joke just isn't funny to me, "Yeah... She will. What about... well... you know who?"  
"哈哈，做出正确决定和美里？" 我开始开玩笑，但话说到一半就停住了，丽似乎觉得有趣，但我意识到这个笑话对我来说并不好笑，"是啊...她会的。那...呃...你知道是谁吗？"

She seems to take a moment to think, "He is doing well."  
她似乎花了一会儿时间思考，“他做得很好。”

She lies to me, a strange thing about Rei is that she isn't a very good liar. She always looks off in the same direction when she does so and her hand twitches on doing so. I decide to not press her on it though. I don't have any right to be too concerned about him or know more considering who I am.  
她对我撒了谎，关于丽的一个奇怪之处是，她并不擅长撒谎。每次撒谎时，她总是朝同一个方向看，而且手会不自觉地抽动。不过我决定不去追问她。考虑到我的身份，我没有权利过于关心他或了解更多。

"He has signed up to take music lessons."  
“他已经报名参加音乐课了。”

I look at her in confusion and shock, "Music lessons? What the hell would he need music lessons for? I... I heard him years ago, he was... he was very good."  
我困惑又震惊地看着她，“音乐课？他到底需要音乐课干什么？我……我多年前听过他演奏，他……他非常出色。”

It was just a shame that I had to go and ruin his night by being... me. I force the memory away as Rei replies to me, "It has been many years since he last played so he believes his skills to be somewhat rusty. He had his first lesson yesterday but I have not yet been in contact to find out how it went."  
只是可惜我不得不破坏他的夜晚，因为我就是……我。我强迫自己忘掉这段记忆，Rei 回答我，“他已经很多年没弹奏了，所以他觉得自己的技艺有些生疏。他昨天上了第一节课，但我还没联系他了解进展如何。”

"He is doing alright though?" I ask once more, in a way hoping that maybe Rei will be more truthful with me.  
“不过他应该还好吧？”我再次问道，心里暗自希望 Rei 能对我更坦诚些。

"Yes." She replies but her tone again indicating that he isn't as good as she is letting on.  
"是的。" 她回答道，但语气再次表明他并不像她表面上显得那么出色。

"I'm glad." I finally reply, "He... He deserves to be happy."  
"我很高兴。" 我终于回答，"他... 他值得幸福。"

My hand clenches into a fist as I avert my eyes from Rei. Those little daggers of guilt appear once more as I think about him, "Especially after everything that I-"  
我的手紧握成拳，目光从丽身上移开。那些小小的内疚之箭再次出现，当我想到他时，"尤其是在经历了我所做的一切之后——"

"Asuka!" Rei cuts me off sternly. I slowly look up into those piercing red eyes of hers. They're frightening and I instantly go quiet, "You should forgive yourself for all that happened. I have told you on numerous occasisions that not only you but we were all very different people back then."  
"明日香！" 绫波严厉地打断了我。我缓缓抬起头，迎上她那双锐利的红色眼眸。它们令人畏惧，我立刻安静了下来，"你应该原谅自己所发生的一切。我多次告诉过你，不仅是你，我们那时都是截然不同的人。"

"I-" I start to protest but Rei doesn't allow me in. After Third Impact Rei did find her voice and she isn't afraid of using it.  
"我——" 我正要反驳，但绫波不给我机会。在第三次冲击之后，绫波确实找到了自己的声音，并且毫不畏惧使用它。

"You are a good person Asuka and... I know that you were back then as well. You might not have always shown it but you were. If you weren't I would not have made such an effort to find you after you left Japan."  
"你是个好人，明日香……我知道你那时也是。你可能并不总是表现出来，但你是的。如果不是这样，我不会在你离开日本后如此努力地寻找你。"

"Yeah but..." "不过但是……"

"I know you see yourself solely as the Asuka who always yelled and shouted at others, who belittled other people and believed herself to be better than other people. The Asuka who would lash out frequently."  
"我知道你只看到那个总是大喊大叫、对别人冷嘲热讽、自认为高人一等的明日香。那个经常发脾气的明日香。"

I feel so much better now.  
我现在感觉好多了。

"But that is not who you are now and not all you were back then. I can look back and see the Asuka who was brave in front of monsters that threatened this world. The Asuka who tried to encourage her teammates to do better. The Asuka who risked her life to protect her friends. A frightened Asuka who wanted to reach out to others. I saw an Asuka who was unselfish, who made an effort to include someone like me when she had no reason to. That Asuka who took us to the ramen cart that night."  
但那不是现在的你，也不是过去的全部。我可以回望，看到那个在面对威胁这个世界的怪物时勇敢的明日香。那个试图鼓励队友做得更好的明日香。那个冒着生命危险保护朋友的明日香。一个想要向他人伸出援手的恐惧的明日香。我看到了一个无私的明日香，她没有理由却努力包容像我这样的人。那个带我们去拉面摊的明日香。

I'd cry on hearing her words if that wouldn't be unbelievably pathetic of me and if I hadn't already used up my weekly supply of tears after my nightmare. So instead I blink rapidly and force the stinging feeling behind my eyes to go away. She mentioned that damn ramen cart again, she has a thing for that.  
如果我不会因此显得无比可悲，如果我在噩梦后没有用尽每周的泪水配额，我会在听到她的话时哭泣。所以我快速眨眼，强迫眼中的刺痛感消失。她再次提到了那个该死的拉面摊，她对那有特别的情感。

I laugh, "Well... Misato couldn't really afford a steak dinner and... you're vegetarian so what else was I supposed to do."  
我笑了，“嗯...美里其实负担不起牛排晚餐，而且...你是素食主义者，我还能做什么呢。

"You were not supposed to do anything. It was not your responsibility, Misato should not have made the promise if she were not able to keep it. Yet you did do something and I am grateful for it."  
"你本不该做任何事的。那不是你的责任，美里如果不能遵守承诺，就不应该做出那样的承诺。但你确实做了些什么，我对此心存感激。"

"Alright!" I try to put an end to this, "You've made your point... I guess I wasn't completely awful. Maybe only 95% awful."  
"好吧！" 我试图结束这个话题，"你已经表达了你的观点...我想我并没有完全糟糕。或许只有 95%糟糕吧。"

She glares at me, "It is an improvement I suppose."  
她瞪了我一眼，"我想这算是一种进步吧。"

I watch as she leans over to grab another pancake. She seems to stop mid motion as her eyes are drawn to something on the counter. Rei does something of a double take as she looks intently at the piece of paper I had left lying there. Her mouth opens slightly as if she is shocked and I take a step forward.  
我看着她俯身去拿另一张煎饼。她的动作似乎在半空中停住了，目光被柜台上的某样东西吸引。丽盯着那张我留在那里的纸条，做了个类似双重视线的动作。她的嘴微微张开，仿佛震惊了，我向前迈了一步。

"Rei… Is everything alright? You've been looking at that piece of paper for nearly a minute now."  
“丽……一切都好吗？你已经盯着那张纸条看了一分钟了。”

She looks up at me and her expression as changed, it's hardened and for a brief moment I wonder if this is it. Is this finally the moment she is going to call me out for all the bad I've done just as I deserve. Naturally she doesn't do that, she instead picks up the piece of paper and holds it in front of me.  
她抬头看向我，表情变了，变得坚硬。有那么一瞬间，我在想这是不是就是那个时刻。她会不会终于要因为我所做的坏事而指责我，正如我所应得的那样。当然，她没有那么做，而是拿起那张纸条，举到我面前。

"This document, where did you get it?"  
"这份文件，你从哪儿弄来的？"

I look at the document she is holding and my heart starts to beat faster in my chest. It's the one that guy dropped yesterday. I can see his name written at the top followed by an address. I don't know why I picked it up, after what happened I probably should have left it there but it looked important. I was going to post it.  
我看着她手中的文件，心跳不由得加速。那是昨天那个男人掉落的，上面写着他的名字和一个地址。我不知道为什么捡了起来，经历了那些事后，我本该让它留在原地，但它看起来很重要。我原本打算寄出去的。

I lean casually on the counter trying to not show any trace of being bothered by Rei holding it up to me or by my memories of yesterday.  
我随意地靠在柜台上，试图不显露出被丽拿着文件质问或昨日记忆所困扰的痕迹。

"Oh that?" I shrug, "I... found it yesterday... some guy was coming into the café I was working in and he didn't look to see where he was going. Idiot bumped right into me and sent us both spilling to the ground. He left and dropped it."  
"哦，那个吗？" 我耸耸肩，"我……昨天发现的……有个家伙走进我打工的咖啡馆，他没看路。笨蛋直接撞上了我，结果我们俩都摔倒了。他走了，还掉了这个。"

Rei is eying me oddly, does she know what happened? Rei has a weird sense of just knowing things from time to time. She looks at the name on the form as if confirming what it says, "You... met this guy? Did anything else happen?"  
丽正用奇怪的眼神看着我，她知道发生了什么吗？丽有时候有种奇怪的直觉，能从一些事情中察觉到什么。她看着表格上的名字，仿佛在确认上面写的是什么，"你……见过这个人吗？还发生了别的事吗？"

I swallow and nod, "Well he... looked at me and he got frightened... he ran away from me. He didn't stop to pick it up he just ran. I... He knew who I was... He knew me Rei, he was frightened of me and he..."  
我咽了咽口水，点点头，"嗯，他……看了我一眼，然后就害怕了……他逃离了我。他没有停下来捡起它，只是跑了。我……他认识我……他认识我，丽，他害怕我，他……"

In a blur of motion Rei sets the form down on the table and moved into wrap me in another of her warm hugs. I don't even try to resist and I put my arms around her and rest my head on her should. I can feel myself on the verge of tears again, "He knew who I was... I've been found out Rei... I've been..."  
"在一阵模糊的动作中，丽将表格放在桌上，随即又用她温暖的拥抱将我环绕。我甚至没有试图抵抗，只是伸出双臂环抱住她，将头靠在她的肩上。我感到自己再次濒临泪水的边缘，“他知道我是谁...我被发现了，丽...我被...””

Rei shakes her head, "No... No, you haven't Asuka. You don't recognize the name on that form do you?"  
"丽摇了摇头，“不...不，你没有，明日香。你不认识表格上的那个名字，对吧？””

Still in her embrace I shake my head, "No... Why would I?"  
"在她怀中，我摇了摇头，“不...我为什么要认识？””

"Asuka that person you met… Kaworu Nagisa, he was the Fifth Child and… he was the final Angel." She informs me darkly and I feel my stomach drop, "I… I need to make a phone call."  
“明日香，你遇到的那个人……渚薰，他是第五适格者，而且……他是最后的使徒。”她阴沉地告诉我，我感到胃里一阵翻腾，“我……我需要打个电话。”

Rei breaks the hug and starts to walk towards her handbag. I reach out and grab her wrist before she can make any motion. I can't let her make a phone call just yet. I need to know more, what does she mean he was the Fifth Child? What does she mean he was the final Angel?  
绫波挣脱了拥抱，开始走向她的手提包。我伸出手抓住她的手腕，阻止她任何动作。我还不能让她打电话。我需要了解更多，她说的第五适格者是什么意思？她说的最后的使徒又是什么意思？

That person who recognized me yesterday was an Eva pilot? That person knew me because of that? I certainly didn't know him so how is that possible. I need to know more information and... I know it's selfish of me considering what she said but I can't let anyone know I'm here.  
昨天认出我的那个人是 EVA 驾驶员？那个人因为那个原因认识我？我当然不认识他，这怎么可能。我需要更多信息，而且……我知道考虑到她说的那些话，我很自私，但我不能让任何人知道我在这里。

"Wait!" I tell her, "No phonecalls, not yet."  
"等等！" 我告诉她，"现在还不能打电话。"

She looks at me, "Asuka, this is serious. He was…"  
她看着我，"明日香，这很严重。他曾是……"

I nod my head, "I know and I believe you Rei it's just… I need to know more first. What do you mean he was both the Fifth Child and the final Angel?"  
我点点头，"我知道，我相信你，丽，只是……我需要了解更多。你说他既是第五适格者又是最后的使徒是什么意思？"

I keep my hand in place and continue to look at Rei. She stares back at me before finally relaxing her pose and putting her handbag on the counter. She walks out of the kitchen into the front room where we both sit opposite one another on the seating. She sighs before looking at me, "I apologize, I… forgot that your memory of that time period is not complete."  
我保持手的位置不变，继续看着丽。她回望着我，最终放松了姿势，将手提包放在柜台上。她走出厨房，来到我们面对面坐在座位上的前厅。她叹了口气，然后看着我说：“我道歉，我……忘记了你对那段时间的记忆并不完整。”

I shake my head, "It's fine, it's not like I ever asked for those blanks to be filled in before. Not really a period of time I want to remember. Start from the beginning, who is Kaworu Nagisa?"  
我摇摇头，“没关系，我以前从未要求填补这些空白。那并不是我想回忆的时期。从头开始，碇真嗣是谁？”

Rei pauses and seems to be deep in thought for a few moments. I can imagine she is finding it tough to come up with the right words to say to me, so I decide to make it easier for her, "The Fifth Child… Shinji was the Third, Touji was the Fourth but he was injured during the activation test so the Fifth Child would have been my replacement right?"  
丽停顿了一下，似乎陷入了深深的思考。我能想象她在努力寻找合适的词句对我说，所以我决定让她更容易些，“第五个孩子……真嗣是第三个，东治是第四个，但他在启动测试中受伤了，所以第五个孩子应该是我的替代者，对吧？”

Rei nods, "Yes… He turned up around the time you…"  
丽点点头，“是的……他出现在你……”

Again I step in to make things easier, "After I ran away and tried to… kill myself?"  
我又一次介入，试图让事情变得简单些，“在我逃跑并试图……自杀之后？”

She nods again and edges closer to me holding out her hand. I place mine on top of hers and tighten around it, "It's alright Rei… I know… what I tried to do. We don't need to avoid the subject."  
她再次点头，并向我靠近，伸出她的手。我将手放在她的手上并握紧，“没事的，丽……我知道……我试图做的事。我们不需要回避这个话题。”

"You are correct, Kaworu was your replacement and arrived shortly after you were found and hospitalized. He immediately befriended Shinji. Shinji was in a very bad place at that time. He had discovered the truth of what I was and had just witnessed me die and become a different person. His friends had left Tokyo-3, you were hurt, Misato wasn't around…It was very easy for someone like Kaworu to manipulate him."  
"你说得没错，渚薰是你的替代者，在你被发现并送医后不久就来到了这里。他很快就和真嗣成为了朋友。那时的真嗣正处于非常糟糕的状态。他发现了我的真实身份，亲眼目睹了我死去并变成了另一个人。他的朋友们离开了第三新东京市，你受了伤，美里也不在身边……像渚薰这样的人很容易操纵他。"

There was genuine venom in Rei's words as she spoke of the boy. It's a little bit unnerving if I'm being honest, I've heard the girl get angry and frustrated before but never anything like this.  
丽提到那个男孩时，话语中确实带着真正的恶意。说实话，这有点让人不安，我以前听过这女孩生气和沮丧，但从未像这样。

"Manipulate him? How so?"  
"操纵他？怎么个操纵法？"

"He became friends with Shinji. He told Shinji things that he wanted to hear and Shinji fell for it and I believe for him."  
"他和真嗣成了朋友。他告诉真嗣他想听的话，真嗣信以为真，我相信他也是。"

"Fell for him?" I ask in some shock, "You mean…"  
"信以为真？" 我有些震惊地问，"你是说…"

I trail off unsure of how to phrase my question. I would not be entirely surprised if he was not in fact heterosexual but the truth was in the time I knew him I never known him to show a romantic interest in anyone, except of course… for those brief fleeting moments when we kissed and when we encountered each other in Third Impact.  
我话没说完，不确定如何表达我的疑问。如果他实际上不是异性恋，我也不会完全惊讶，但说实话，在我认识他的这段时间里，我从没见过他对任何人表现出浪漫的兴趣，当然，除了…那些短暂而转瞬即逝的时刻，我们接吻的时候，以及在第三次冲击中相遇的时候。

Rei nods again, "I do not doubt that there was some romantic attachment on the part of Shinji. Whether it is because of Kaworu appearing at the right time or not I do not know. My brother has never shown any romantic or sexual interest in anyone. I wanted to say or do something at the time but things were very muddle for me in my third body… Also given what Shinji has just discovered about me I did not feel he would trust me."  
丽再次点头，“我不怀疑真嗣对渚薰有某种浪漫情感。至于这是否因为渚薰恰逢其时出现，我不得而知。我弟弟从未对任何人表现出浪漫或性方面的兴趣。当时我想说些什么或做些什么，但我的第三使徒形态让我感到非常混乱……而且，鉴于真嗣刚刚发现我的秘密，我觉得他不会信任我。”

"So what happened?" “那后来发生了什么？”

"Barely a couple of days after he arrived Kaworu snuck into NERV and hijacked Unit 02. His Angel form allowed him to manipulate the Eva and he used it to descend towards Central Dogma."  
“他到达后不过几天，渚薰就潜入了 NERV 并劫持了二号机。他的使徒形态使他能够操控 EVA，并利用它向中央教条区降落。”

Anger flares up inside of me at hearing Rei say this, not so much at the betrayal but at the fact that he used my Unit 02 to do it. How dare he do such a thing, how dare he takes what was mine!  
听到丽这么说，我心中怒火中烧，倒不是因为背叛，而是他用我的零二号机做了这件事。他怎么敢这样做，怎么敢夺走属于我的东西！

"On reaching Central Dogma he found out that he was standing in front of Lilith and now Adam like he thought. He realized that much like he had used Shinji, SEELE had used him and meant for him to fulfil his role in their plan and die. It was Shinji who dealt the final blow. It… broke Shinji. Kaworu wasn't human but he looked, sounded and smelled human. He was much more human than I was, Shinji not only had to deal with the loss and betrayal of a friend but with killing what was a living person."  
到达中央教条区后，他发现自己正站在莉莉丝和亚当面前，正如他所料。他意识到，就像他利用了真嗣一样，SEELE 也利用了他，意图让他完成他们在计划中的角色并死去。是真嗣给予了最后一击。那……击垮了真嗣。渚薰虽非人类，但他看起来、听起来、闻起来都像人类。他比我更像人类，真嗣不仅要面对朋友的失去和背叛，还要面对杀死一个活生生的人的事实。

I lower my eyes, I know what happened after this. I know the events afterwards, "I see, no wonder he…"  
我垂下眼帘，我知道这之后发生了什么。我知道后续的事件，“我明白了，难怪他会……”

I can remember those moments before Third Impact quite clearly. Being in my Eva and fighting, waiting, hoping that he would show up to save the day. I had never wanted it to happen so badly but it wasn't to be. I died on that day except… I didn't really die. Instead I was pulled into Instrumentality and forced to relive moments and try to untangle the mess of my fucked up life.  
我清晰地记得第三次冲击前的那些时刻。身处我的 Eva 中战斗、等待，期盼着他能出现拯救一切。我从未如此渴望它发生，但终究未能如愿。那天我死了，然而……我并没有真正死去。相反，我被卷入了人类补完计划，被迫重温那些瞬间，试图解开我那混乱不堪的生活。

I feel Rei's warm hand tighten around mine, "I apologize for making you relive your memories of those moments. I know they are painful, they are for me too. If you wish I will go."  
我感到丽温暖的手紧紧握住我的，“我为让你重温那些记忆而道歉。我知道它们很痛苦，对我来说也是如此。如果你愿意，我会离开。”

I look up at her and shake my head, "No please… stay. I'm glad you're here it's just… a lot to take in. I just… I didn't know about any of this. No one told me and I never bothered to ask. It just… puts a lot of things in perspective now."  
我抬头看着她，摇了摇头，“不，请……留下来。我很高兴你在这里，只是……这一切难以消化。我只是……我对此一无所知。没人告诉我，我也从未问过。现在……这让我对很多事情有了新的认识。”

As I speak I hear my voice start to tremble slightly. I blink away the tears again, in some way my heart feels somewhat lighter at hearing the strange tale of Kaworu Nagisa. He did recognize me and he must have been frightened of me but not for the reasons I thought, it was because he must have thought I knew what he did and I'd hurt him.  
当我说话时，我听到自己的声音开始微微颤抖。我再次眨去泪水，不知为何，听到渚薰那奇异的故事，我的心感到一丝轻松。他确实认出了我，他一定被我吓到了，但不是我以为的原因，而是因为他一定以为我知道他所做的事，我会伤害他。

I look up at Rei's frowning face and feel that if I were to hurt Kaworu I'd have to get into a queue behind Rei. The only thing is I have no wish to hurt him, I don't want to be that angry person, I don't want to hurt people anymore even if they do deserve it in some way.  
我抬头看着绫波皱眉的脸，感觉如果要伤害渚薰，我得排在绫波后面。唯一的问题是，我并不想伤害他，我不想成为那个愤怒的人，我不想再伤害任何人，即使他们某种程度上应受惩罚。

I don't really understand why Kaworu would have ran from me though. If he is an Angel then why would he be afraid fo a human like me.  
我不太明白为什么渚薰会从我身边逃开。如果他是使徒，那他为什么会害怕像我这样的人类。

"He must have… known who I was yesterday then. That's why he ran like that but… if why would he run?" I ask Rei to see if maybe she knows.  
"他昨天肯定……知道我是谁了。所以他才那样跑掉，但是……如果他为什么要跑呢？" 我问丽，看她是否可能知道。

"I do not know." Rei replies to me, "I do not know why he is alive right now but I wish to find out. I also want to make sure no harm comes to you or anyone. He will not hurt one of my friends again."  
"我不知道。" 丽回答我，"我不知道他为什么现在还活着，但我希望能弄清楚。我也想确保你或任何人不受伤害。他不会再伤害我的朋友了。"

I muster up a grin, "I can take care of myself Rei. I'll… let you make your phone call, just… don't… mention… if you can."  
我勉强挤出一个笑容，"我能照顾好自己，丽。我会……让你打你的电话，只是……别……提到……如果可以的话。"

"Do not worry, I will be sure to not mention your involvement in this."  
"别担心，我保证不会提及你在这件事中的参与。"

"Thank you." "谢谢你。"

**Misato Katsuragi 葛城美里**

**Tokyo-2 – Early Evening  东京-2 —— 傍晚时分**

I leave the small meeting room and head straight down the corridor towards my temporary office. The meeting was admittedly not quite as productive as I'd have hoped. A lot of the focus was on them questioning me and my actions during the war against the Angels.  
我离开那间小会议室，径直沿着走廊走向我的临时办公室。坦白说，这次会议并没有我期望的那么有成效。大部分时间他们都围绕着我在对抗使徒战争中的行为对我进行质询。

I know why they did it, they want to find out who I am, who I was and whether I'm worthy enough to accomplish what I need to do. They want to see if I'm capable and strong enough and want to see if my personal feelings aren't getting in the way. They want to make me look stupid so they can all get their people in there and freeze us out.  
我明白他们的意图，他们想弄清楚我是谁，我过去是谁，以及我是否有能力完成我需要做的事情。他们想确认我是否足够能干和坚强，同时也要看看我的个人情感是否会成为障碍。他们试图让我显得愚蠢，以便他们能安插自己的人进来，把我们排挤出去。

I can't say I didn't expect any of it though, it was something that I discussed in length with Maya and the others before we decided to go into this. So, I did my best to remain calm and focused. I answered any and all questions as professionally as I could. I deflected when I was able to and tried to keep everything on track to what to do with Tokyo-3.  
虽然我不能说我完全没有预料到这些，但在我们决定进入这个领域之前，我已经和真希波和其他人详细讨论过了。因此，我尽力保持冷静和专注。我尽可能专业地回答了所有问题。当我能够时，我会巧妙地转移话题，并试图将一切保持在处理第三新东京市的轨道上。

In a way I am still questioning why I'm doing this. Maybe my personal feelings are getting in the way somehow but Fuyutsuki persuaded me I was the best person for it and I'd make the right decisions. He wants me to do this and I believed him.  
在某种程度上，我仍然在质疑自己为什么要这样做。也许我的个人情感在某种程度上影响了判断，但冬月说服了我，我是最适合做这件事的人，我会做出正确的决定。他希望我这样做，我相信他。

It isn't as if no progress was made during the meeting though. We now have a date for the next meeting and we know that each interested party will be presenting their team to do an exploratory sweep of the abandoned zone. I've already selected Maya and Makoto as my team. If there are any people best suited for it it'd be those two. Ritsuko would have course been an ideal candidate too but nothing will persuade her to join us. She seems happy teaching at a local school now and I can't blame her.  
尽管如此，会议并非毫无进展。我们现在有了下一次会议的日期，并且知道每个感兴趣的团体都将派出他们的团队对废弃区域进行勘察。我已经选定了真希波和真琴作为我的团队。如果有最适合的人选，那一定是他们两个。律子当然也是一个理想的人选，但没有什么能说服她加入我们。她现在似乎很高兴在当地学校教书，我不能责怪她。

As I enter the office I feel my phone vibrating in my bad. I quickly pull it out and glance at the caller ID. It's Rei, that's unusual, I thought that she was enjoying herself in America at this moment. Why would she be calling me now?  
当我走进办公室时，感觉到手机在包里震动。我迅速掏出手机，瞥了一眼来电显示。是丽，这很奇怪，我以为她现在正在美国享受呢。她为什么现在给我打电话？

Hoping everything is alright I answer, "Hello, Rei? Is everything alright?"  
希望一切都好，我接起电话，“喂，丽？一切都好吗？”

There is a small pause and I hear the sound of a door closing, "Hello Misato, everything is fine."  
电话那头稍稍停顿了一下，我听到了关门的声音，“你好，美里，一切都好。”

I relax my shoulders and breathe out a sigh of relief, "Oh good! How is America?"  
我放松了肩膀，松了一口气，“哦，太好了！美国那边怎么样？”

There is another brief pause, "I am not currently in America. I am actually in Germany right now, Berlin to be precise."  
又是一阵短暂的停顿，“我现在不在美国。实际上，我现在在德国，准确地说是在柏林。”

"Berlin?" I exclaim, what the hell is Rei doing in Berlin?  
“柏林？”我惊呼道，Rei 到底在柏林干什么？

"What are you doing in Berlin?" I ask her, I already have a suspicion, one I've had for quite some time but I've never spoken or asked about it. It's a bit of an unwritten rule in our home that we don't speak of certain things. I wonder if... Well I doubt Rei will say one way or the other.  
"你在柏林做什么？" 我问她，我心里已经有了一个猜测，这个猜测我已经揣摩了很久，但从未提起或询问过。在我们家里，有些事情是不成文的规定，我们不谈论。我在想，如果……嗯，我怀疑丽不会明确表态。

"America bored me." She replied, "So I decided to come to Europe instead. It was something of an impulsive decision I made yesterday."  
"美国让我感到无聊。" 她回答道，"所以我决定来欧洲。这是昨天我一时冲动做出的决定。"

"Oh." I shrug casually, "As long as you're alright."  
"哦。" 我随意地耸了耸肩，"只要你没事就好。"

"I am doing fine but... there is a reason I am calling you. Since arriving I have... seen something..."  
"我一切都好，但是...我打电话给你是有原因的。自从到达这里，我...看到了一些东西..."

I feel a little pang of nervousness in my stomach as she says that. My mind immediately begins to wander to dark places, I can't help it. I worry about her, I know she is sensible, probably the most sensible out of all of us and she is incredibly mature too considering she has only really started to explore her own humanity over the last few years but she is not invincible.  
听到她这么说，我感到一丝紧张在胃里翻腾。我的思绪立刻飘向了阴暗的角落，我无法控制。我担心她，我知道她很理智，可能是我们中最理智的一个，而且考虑到她只是在过去几年才开始真正探索自己的人性，她的成熟程度也令人难以置信，但她并非无懈可击。

Added with the fact that she is currently in Germany I begin to run over other worst-case scenarios. That thing which we don't speak of, is it something to do with that? Has Rei seen her? Is...  
再加上她现在在德国，我开始设想其他最坏的情况。那个我们不提的东西，是和它有关吗？丽是否看到了她？还是...

My own thoughts are cut off by Rei speaking, "Kaworu Nagisa is alive."  
我的思绪被丽的话语打断，“渚薰还活着。”

My jaw drops, that was certainly not what I was expecting to hear. In a million years I would not have ran that scenario through my head. I find myself unable to say anything in response to her. In a way I'm relieved that it was not one of the things I had thought of, in another I'm terrified knowing what this could represent.  
我惊得下巴都掉了，这绝对不是我预料中的答案。就算给我一百万年，我也想不到会是这种情况。我发现自己无法回应她。一方面，我松了口气，因为这不是我之前想到的任何一种可能；另一方面，我感到恐惧，因为这可能意味着什么。

"Misato are you there?" “美里，你在吗？”

Rei's voice brings me back down to Earth, I have to make sure she did in fact say what I thought she did.  
丽的声音将我拉回现实，我必须确认她确实说了我以为她说的那句话。

"Rei... Can you repeat that please?"  
“丽……你能再说一遍吗？”

"Yes. Kaworu Nagisa is alive."  
“是的。渚薰还活着。”

Kaworu Nagisa... A name I haven't heard of in a long time. If that other subject is not spoken about in our home then the subject of Kaworu is even more complicated. My mind immediately wanders to Shinji and how he would react to this news. I know exactly how Shinji feels about Kaworu. I know Shinji still harbours feelings of guilt towards what he did, towards what he had to do. I can understand it though, killing someone is not a pleasant thing... even if they are your enemy.  
渚薰...一个我许久未曾听闻的名字。如果家里不提及另一个话题，那么关于渚薰的话题则更为复杂。我的思绪立刻飘向了真嗣，想象他会如何回应这个消息。我清楚真嗣对渚薰的感情。我知道真嗣仍对所做之事心怀愧疚，对不得不做的事感到内疚。我能理解，毕竟，杀人绝非愉快之事...即便对方是敌人。

"Okay Rei..." I try to focus myself and make an attempt to switch to Major Katsuragi mode, "Tell me more, when did you see him? How did you see him? Are you certain it was him?"  
“好的，绫波...”我努力集中精神，试图切换到葛城美里少校模式，“告诉我更多，你何时见到他的？如何见到的？你确定是他吗？”

So Rei tells me, keeping her words short and to the point, "I saw him yesterday, he was entering a small café in the city but I do not recall the name. I am certain it was him, there is no mistaking that."  
绫波简洁明了地告诉我：“我昨天见到他，他正进入城里的一家小咖啡馆，但我不记得名字了。我确信是他，绝不会认错。”

"Right." I nod my head, "And did he see you at all?"  
"好的。" 我点点头，"那他有没有看到你？"

"No."

"Good." I nod again, "Look Rei, I know you're on holiday but I'm going to ask you to cut it short. I want you to come back to Japan as soon as you can, I'm going to find out more about this."  
"很好。" 我又点了点头，"听着，丽，我知道你在度假，但我希望你能提前结束。我想让你尽快回日本，我要查清楚这件事。"

"Understood." "明白了。"

"Goodbye Rei, see you soon."  
"再见，丽，很快见。"

"See you soon Misato." "很快见，美里。"

Rei hangs up the phone and I stand there in disbelief for at least a minute. Kaworu Nagisa is back on this Earth and has somehow found himself in Berlin. That one thing I have been afraid of for so long has happened. If Nagisa is back then what else does that mean? Does it mean more Angels can return? Does it mean SEELE are back?  
丽挂断电话，我站在那里难以置信至少一分钟。渚薰回到了地球，不知怎么地出现在柏林。那个我长久以来一直害怕的事情发生了。如果薰回来了，那还意味着什么？是否意味着更多使徒能够回归？是否意味着 Seele 也回来了？

I try to focus my thoughts, there is no point jumping to conclusions just yet. What I need to do is gather information first if I rush into doing something then people are going to get hurt, most of all that kid who is sitting back in my apartment right now. I need to protect him most of all.  
我试图集中思绪，现在就急于下结论毫无意义。我需要先收集信息，如果贸然行动，人们会受到伤害，尤其是现在正坐在我公寓里的那个孩子。我最需要保护的就是他。

So, what do I do now? There are a few people I can contact but I suppose my first port of call will be the person I always turn to for advice. I'll start with her, she might know something before I go further down the rabbit hole.  
那么，我现在该怎么办？有几个我可以联系的人，但我想我的首选应该是我总是寻求建议的那个人。我会先找她，也许在我进一步深入之前，她已经知道些什么了。

It doesn't take long before answers the phone. She sounds happy and I immediately feel bad for what I'm about to say, "Hello MIsato, just finished your meeting I'm guessing."  
电话很快就被接通了。她的声音听起来很高兴，我立刻为自己即将说的话感到内疚，“你好，美里，我猜你的会议刚结束吧。”

I don't greet her, "Ritsuko, Kaworu Nagisa is back."  
我没有向她打招呼，“律子，渚薰回来了。”

There is silence and I imagine her in very much a similar state to what I was when Rei told me. Her voice comes back moments later, "Can you repeat that?"  
一片寂静，我想象着她的状态与我听到绫波告诉我时相似。片刻后，她的声音传来，“你能再说一遍吗？”

"Kaworu Nagisa is back." “渚薰回来了。”

She isn't silent this time, "Are you sure? How do you know?"  
这次她没有沉默，“你确定吗？你怎么知道的？”

"Rei just phoned to tell me, she is currently in Berlin and she saw him."  
“丽刚刚打电话告诉我，她目前在柏林，并且看到了他。”

"When?" “什么时候？”

"Some point yesterday, he was entering a café there. He didn't see her though fortunately."  
"昨天某个时刻，他正走进那里的咖啡馆。不过幸运的是，他没看到她。"

"You're sure she didn't just make a mistake."  
"你确定她不是搞错了。"

"Ritsuko, this is Rei we're talking about here, if she says she saw him then we can be sure of it. Besides... how many people do you think there are who look like Kaworu Nagisa?"  
"律子，我们说的是绫波，如果她说她看到了他，那我们就可以确信。再说...你觉得有多少人长得像渚薰？"

"True..." Ritsuko pauses for a moment, "I don't understand though, how can he be back? He was..."  
"真的..." 赤木律子顿了一下，"不过我不明白，他怎么可能回来了？他曾经..."

"An Angel?" I finish Ritsuko's sentence for her, "I don't know Rits, I was hoping you might know something."  
"成了天使？" 我替赤木律子说完这句话，"我不知道，律子，我本以为你可能知道些什么。"

"I'm afraid I can't really help you, I know nothing about him either. His name came up on reports back then but that was literally just it, a name and a date of birth. I didn't have access to any further information on him, you know how NERV was and by the time he arrived I wasn't exactly in good standing with others..."  
"恐怕我也帮不上忙，关于他我也一无所知。他的名字和出生日期当时出现在报告上，但也就仅此而已。我没有权限获取更多关于他的信息，你知道 NERV 那时的状况，而且他出现时，我与其他人的关系并不融洽..."

I bow my head at hearing her say that, in my panic to try to learn more I had forgotten just what had happened to Ritsuko at that point in time. With the way she carries herself now it's easy to forget that she was deep into her own personal hell back then too."  
听到她这么说，我低下头，在急于了解更多情况时，我忘记了那时丽津子经历了什么。现在她这样从容不迫，很容易让人忘记她当时也深陷个人地狱。

"I know... Sorry." “我知道……对不起。”

"It's fine, out of all the people back then I am the one most likely to know something. The best I can offer is that Kaworu seemed to be similar to Rei, a hybrid of Angel and human, he was also a part of SEELE's dummy plug system."  
“没关系，在那时的人中，我最有可能知道一些事情。我能提供的最好信息是，渚薰似乎和绫波零类似，是天使与人类的混血，他也是 SEELE 的傀儡系统的一部分。”

"So like Rei... he would have had spares..."  
"就像丽...他应该有备用品..."

"Exactly. Although anything like that would have been kept in SEELEs main strongholds which were raided years ago. I don't remember them finding anything like that."  
"没错。尽管这类东西应该都存放在 SEELE 的主要据点，而这些据点多年前就被突袭了。我不记得他们找到过类似的东西。"

"Well if they did they could have kept it secret, Rei and Kaworu... were miracles of science really. I imagine a lot of people would want to keep hold of that sort of thing." My mind then leaps immediately to the worst case, "You don't think that... SEELE might still be..."  
"如果他们真的找到了，可能会保密。丽和薰...确实是科学的奇迹。我想很多人都会想保留这种东西。"" 我的思绪立刻跳到了最坏的情况，""你不会认为...SEELE 可能还在..."

"We shouldn't jump to conclusions yet." Ritsuko says to me, "I'm just offering one possibility, there are others. He could have... returned just like Rei did."  
"我们还不应该急于下结论。" 律子对我说，"我只是提出一种可能性，还有其他的。他可能...就像丽一样回来了。"

I know she is right, I shouldn't leap to the worst-case scenario but I want to prepare myself just in case. There is a brief pause before she speaks again, "Are you going to tell Shinji?"  
我知道她是对的，我不应该直接想到最坏的情况，但我想要做好准备以防万一。短暂的停顿后，她再次开口，"你要告诉真嗣吗？"

"No... Not yet, he's... having a tough time at the moment with the music lessons thing and I don't want to add to that. Until I learn more I think I'll keep this quiet."  
"不...暂时不告诉他，他...现在因为音乐课的事情已经很艰难了，我不想再给他增加负担。在我了解更多之前，我想我会保持沉默。"

"A wise decision." She pauses again, "Speak to Fuyutsuki, I know you don't like dealing with him and... well I'm not a fan either but he does seem to be genuinely trying to help. If anyone is likely to know something it'll be him."  
"明智的决定。" 她再次停顿，"去找冬月谈谈，我知道你不喜欢和他打交道，而且……好吧，我也不太喜欢他，但他似乎确实在努力帮忙。如果有人可能知道些什么，那一定是他。"

I sigh, "I know... Fuyutsuki it is then. Bye Rits."  
我叹了口气，"我知道了……那就找冬月吧。再见，律子。"

"Goodbye Misato and... good luck."  
"再见，美里，还有……祝你好运。"

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

**Berlin – Mid Afternoon 柏林 – 午后时分**

I shift myself around on my seat trying to get comfortable and reach across the desk for my cup of coffee. My fingertips grace the top of the plastic cup and I gently grip and lift it. I raise it slightly from the desk when a sudden knock at the door causes me to jump in fright. I let out a noise and drop the cup, it falls to the desk, some of the contents spilling onto my hand and the rest down the desk onto the floor below.  
我挪动着身体，试图在座位上找到一个舒适的姿势，然后伸手去拿桌上的咖啡杯。我的指尖轻触到塑料杯的顶部，轻轻握住并将其提起。当我正要将杯子从桌上稍稍举起时，突然的敲门声让我吓了一跳。我发出一声惊呼，杯子从手中滑落，掉在桌上，一些咖啡溅到了我的手上，剩下的则顺着桌子流到了地板上。

I look up and see Fuyutsuki enter the office, he looks around briefly taking in the sight of the mess I've made and then the sight of me clutching my hand in pain, "Nagisa! Are you alright?"  
我抬头看见冬月走进办公室，他环顾四周，目光扫过我制造的混乱，然后看到我痛苦地紧握着手，“渚！你还好吗？”

I nod my head angrily, annoyed at myself for letting this happen and ending with me looking like an idiot in front of Fuyutsuki. Ever since last night I've been a bag of nerves. I barely got any sleep last night and I've been unable to focus on anything so far today. I keep on shaking and every noise is getting to me. Coming into work was a struggle, I keep on expecting to see her wherever I go, I keep on expecting to see the others and expecting them to give me what I deserve.  
我愤怒地点头，对自己让这种情况发生并在冬月面前显得像个傻瓜感到恼火。自从昨晚以来，我一直紧张不安。昨晚我几乎没怎么睡，今天一整天都无法集中注意力。我一直在发抖，每一个噪音都让我心烦意乱。来上班是一场挣扎，我走到哪里都期待看到她，我走到哪里都期待看到其他人，期待他们给我应得的。

Fuyutsuki takes a look at my hand and shakes his head, "Wait here I'll go and get you a cloth. I don't think you've burnt anything."  
冬月看了看我的手，摇了摇头，“在这儿等着，我去给你拿块布。我觉得你没有烫伤什么。”

I nod again as Fuyutsuki leaves the office and slips into the kitchen down the corridor. In the meantime I sit myself down on my seat and let out a sigh as I watch the spilled coffee drip off of the desk onto the floor. I suppose I should think myself lucky that it didn't hit anything on my desk.  
我再次点头，看着冬月离开办公室，悄悄走进走廊尽头的厨房。与此同时，我坐回自己的座位，叹了口气，看着洒出的咖啡从桌面上滴落到地板上。我想我应该庆幸它没有溅到桌上的任何东西。

As I sit and wait for Fuyutsuki to return my mind once again replays the scene from yesterday. My unfortunate encounter with the former Second Child, Asuka Langley Soryu. I find myself asking a number of questions about it, what was she doing here? Is anyone else here with her? Did she even recognize me?  
当我坐着等待冬月回来时，昨天的那一幕再次在我脑海中重演。我与前二号适格者，惣流·明日香·兰格雷不幸的相遇。我不禁对这次遭遇提出了一系列问题，她在这里做什么？还有其他人跟她在一起吗？她是否认出了我？

I try to think about what I know about her. I know she is originally from Germany but from what I understood she had made Japan her home as a pilot. I only had access to minimal files on her but my understanding was that her family situation was complicated and she had expressed a desire to her guardian to remain in Japan.  
我试图回忆我对她的了解。我知道她原本来自德国，但据我所知，作为驾驶员，她已将日本视为自己的家。我只能接触到她有限的档案，但我的理解是，她的家庭状况复杂，她曾向她的监护人表达过希望留在日本的愿望。

I lean back and wonder about my other questions. She seemed to be alone at the time but that doesn't mean anything. She could have been meeting someone in the café or going to meet someone after being in there. As for whether or not she recognized me, she was incapacitated when I went into NERV but I'm sure in all the years that have passed for her someone would have told her about me.  
我向后靠去，思索着其他问题。她当时似乎是一个人，但这并不意味着什么。她可能在咖啡馆里与人会面，或者在那儿之后要去见某人。至于她是否认出了我，我进入 NERV 时她已经无法行动，但我确信，这些年过去了，总会有人告诉她关于我的事。

She didn't seem to recognize me but in the confusion of it all I don't think she had the chance to properly take a look. Still I know myself I'm not exactly normal looking so there is a chance she'll have recognized me.  
她似乎没有认出我，但在那一片混乱中，我想她没有机会仔细看清楚。尽管如此，我了解自己，我看起来并不普通，所以她有可能认出了我。

Fuyutsuki finally reenters the room with a cloth and a handful of paper towels. I take them from him and start to clean up the mess I've made. As I do so I can feel his eyes on me and I wonder if he is angry at me for what happened. I look up and see the same sympathetic eyes I've seen from him since I first met him.  
冬月终于带着一块布和一把纸巾回到了房间。我从他手中接过，开始清理我造成的混乱。在清理的过程中，我能感觉到他的目光在我身上，我不知道他是否因为发生的事情而对我生气。我抬头看去，看到的依旧是自初次见面以来他那充满同情的眼神。

"Nagisa, Is everything okay with you today? You have seemed somewhat distracted all day and it is most unlike you, did something happen at the interview yesterday?"  
渚，你今天一切都好吗？你一整天都显得有些心不在焉，这可不像你啊，昨天面试是不是发生了什么事？

I avert my gaze from him and I actually consider lying to him and telling him I'm fine. It seems embarrassing to admit the truth but I know that if I don't things might get worse. So I swallow what little I have of my pride and shake my head, "I… The interview went fine yesterday, they are eager for me to start."  
我避开他的目光，甚至考虑对他撒谎说自己没事。承认真相似乎很尴尬，但我知道如果我不说，情况可能会变得更糟。于是我咽下仅存的一点自尊，摇了摇头，“我……昨天的面试挺顺利的，他们急着让我开始工作。”

"I see, so what is the issue?"  
“这样啊，那问题出在哪里呢？”

"On the way back from the interview I was going to go into a small café to relax and… there was an incident. I… encountered someone…"  
"从面试回来的路上，我本打算进一家小咖啡馆放松一下，然后……发生了一件事。我……遇到了某个人……"

His expression turns from sympathetic to deathly serious and he steps forward, "Was this someone you know?"  
他的表情从同情转为极其严肃，他向前一步，"你认识这个人吗？"

"Yes… Well no… sort of…" I fumble my words, "I don't know them exactly but I know of them and I fear that I am known to then. I saw… the Second Child… I saw Asuka Langley Soryu."  
"是的……呃，不……算是吧……" 我结结巴巴地说，"我不确切认识他们，但我听说过他们，而且我担心他们也知道我。我看到了……第二适格者……我看到了惣流·明日香·兰格雷。"

"Ah!" Fuyutsuki takes a step back from me and shakes his head, "I see… I was afraid that something like this might happen eventually."  
"啊！" 冬月从我身边退后一步，摇了摇头，"我明白了……我担心这种事情最终会发生。"

"Y-You were afraid of something like this happening?" I ask him and find it hard to hide my surprise, I don't know if I should be angry or not at hearing this, "Did you know Asuka was here in Berlin?"  
"你担心会发生这种事？" 我问他，难以掩饰自己的惊讶，不知道听到这个消息是否该生气，"你知道明日香在柏林吗？"

"He gives a small nod and goes to sit down at his desk, "I am afraid I did know but I did not anticipate any issues. Belin is a vast city and the odds of you two meeting were slim."  
"他微微点头，走到桌前坐下，"我确实知道，但没想到会有什么问题。柏林是个大城市，你们俩相遇的几率很小。"

I finish cleaning my desk and the area around it and deposit the kitchen towel into the small bin before sitting back down at my desk. My hand is still stinging from where the coffee hit it and I try to process what Fuyutsuki has told me.  
我清理完桌面及周围区域，将厨房毛巾丢进小垃圾桶，然后重新坐回桌前。我的手仍因咖啡溅到而刺痛，我试图消化冬月告诉我的事情。

"I must apologize to you Nagisa, perhaps I should have told you before that there was a risk of you encountering her but from what is known of her we didn't think it'd be a factor. Can I ask… did anything happen when you saw her?"  
“我必须向你道歉，渚，也许我早该告诉你有可能会遇到她，但根据已知信息，我们没想到这会成为问题。我能问一下……你见到她时发生了什么吗？”

"No…" I say to him, "I accidentally bumped into her when she was coming out of the café, she yelled at me and I tried to help her up to her feet. When I realized who she was I… I turned and ran away. I don't think she recognized me."  
“没有……”我对他说，“我在她从咖啡馆出来时无意中撞到了她，她对我大喊大叫，我试图扶她起来。当我意识到她是谁时，我……转身跑开了。我想她没有认出我。”

"Perhaps she didn't… A lot of time has passed and I don't think Asuka has ever been properly informed of that period of time. Asuka…" Fuyutsuki bows his head, "Asuka decided shortly after Third Impact to return to Germany and cut off all contact with her former friends and colleagues. We do of course monitor her for her own safety but she wishes nothing to do with us."  
“或许她并不知情……时间已经过去很久，我不认为明日香曾被妥善告知那段时期的情况。明日香……” 冬月低头说道，“在第三次冲击后不久，明日香决定返回德国，并切断了与所有旧友和同事的联系。我们当然出于她的安全考虑对她进行监控，但她希望与我们毫无瓜葛。”

Fuyutsuki stops there and I wonder if there is anything more to the story than he is telling me. I wonder why Asuka chose to leave Japan behind and why she decided to cut off contact from others. I know little else about her, my focus when I went to Tokyo-3 was on Shinji as he was the only other active pilot. I decide now is not the best time to inquire about such things.  
冬月说到这里便停下了，我不禁猜测他是否还有更多未透露的故事。我想知道明日香为何选择离开日本，又为何决定与他人断绝联系。我对她的了解甚少，我在东京-3 时主要关注的是真嗣，因为他是唯一活跃的驾驶员。我决定现在不是询问这些事情的最佳时机。

Fuyutsuki addresses me again, "Again I apologize that I did not tell you that there was a risk of this. If you wish you can take the rest of the day off and we can look into rehoming you elsewhere to prevent such things."  
冬月再次向我致意，“再次为我没有告知你这种风险而道歉。如果你愿意，可以休息一天，我们可以考虑为你重新安排住处，以避免此类事情发生。”

I shake my head, "N-No… I would… This place is my home now and I am grateful to be here and to be able to work here. I want to continue living here. I have very little here but what I do have I like and I don't want to lose it, I would rather stay."  
我摇摇头，“不……我不会……这里现在是我的家，我很感激能在这里，能在这里工作。我想继续住在这里。我拥有的东西不多，但我喜欢我所拥有的，我不想失去它们，我宁愿留下来。”

"Very well." He replies, "If you have any issues please let me know. I don't want to see you hurt."  
“很好。”他回答，“如果你有任何问题，请告诉我。我不想看到你受伤。”

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

**Berlin – Early evening 柏林 —— 傍晚时分**

Why am I doing this? It's a question that I've been asking myself constantly since I left my apartment just under thirty minutes ago. I round a street corner and pull the envelope out of my pocket and pop the small form out. I glance at the address and compare it with the apartment block I'm now stood in front of. This is definitely the right place.  
我为何要这么做？自从大约三十分钟前离开公寓，这个问题就一直萦绕在我心头。我转过一个街角，从口袋里掏出信封，取出里面的小纸条。瞥了一眼地址，与眼前这栋公寓楼对比确认。这里无疑就是目的地。

My hand hovers over the buzzer and I once again ask myself just why I'm doing this. I don't have any answer except that I'm curious. I'm curious as to why Kaworu Nagisa fled from me yesterday, I'm curious as to who he is and how he came back, I'm curious as to why he is in Berlin right now. I continue to stand in front of the buzzer as a certain saying about cats and curiosity runs through my head.  
我的手悬停在门铃上方，再次自问究竟为何要这么做。除了好奇，我找不到其他答案。我好奇为什么渚薰昨天从我身边逃离，好奇他是谁、又是如何回来的，好奇他此刻为何会在柏林。我站在门铃前，脑海中不禁浮现出那句关于猫和好奇心的俗语。

I dread to think what Rei would think or say if she knew I was doing this. My finger finally presses the buzzer and I wait, there is no sound from the device and I press it again. There is still no sound and I look down at the door and see the lock is broken. I shake my head and gently push the door open and step inside the lobby.  
我不敢想象丽如果知道我在做这件事会怎么想或说什么。我的手指终于按下了门铃，我等待着，设备没有发出任何声音，我又按了一次。仍然没有声音，我低头看向门，发现锁是坏的。我摇了摇头，轻轻推开门，走进了大堂。

It would have been so easy for me to just post this to him but for some reason I was compelled to deliver it to him myself. After a bit of walking I finally reach his door, it's an unassuming brown wooden door just like the many others in the hallway. I knock twice and wait, listening out for sounds of movement. I take one cautious step back from the door and prepare for the worst.  
我本可以很容易地直接寄给他，但不知为何，我被驱使着亲自送给他。走了一段路后，我终于到了他的门前，这是一扇不起眼的棕色木门，就像走廊上的许多其他门一样。我敲了两下，等待着，留意着是否有动静的声音。我小心翼翼地后退一步，准备应对最坏的情况。

Yesterday is replaying in my head, how I collided with him and we were both sent spilling to the ground. How he got up and ran from me and how I lost a night's sleep because of it. I think about all those things Rei told me about him in her attempt to fill in some of the blanks. This guy was the last Angel, strange I didn't think they could take human form.  
昨天的一幕在我脑海中重现，我如何与他相撞，我们俩都摔倒在地。他如何起身逃离我，以及我因此失眠了一整夜。我想起了丽试图填补空白时告诉我的关于他的那些事。这家伙是最后一个天使，奇怪的是，我没想到他们能以人类形态出现。

I wonder if I should be scared of him, judging by his reaction yesterday probably not but then what should I feel about him? Should I be angry at him? For doing what he did to… for what he did to a certain other person? For nearly destroying this world. In that way he is no different from me but at least I suppose I was at least honest about what a horrible person I was.  
我不知是否该怕他，从他昨天的反应来看或许不必，但那我又该对他有何感受？我该对他生气吗？因为他对……对某个人所做的事？因为他差点毁了这个世界。在这点上，他和我没什么不同，但至少我想我对自己是个多么糟糕的人还算坦诚。

After a time, I hear the sounds of a lock opening and the door opens slowly to reveal Kaworu Nagisa to me. I'm only able to catch a glimpse of him, it looks like he is still in his work clothes, he's wearing a pair of smart grey trousers, a plain white shirt and orange tie. That is all I'm able to see of him before he locks eyes with me, he jumps backwards and immediately tries to slam the door in my face.  
过了一会儿，我听到开锁的声音，门缓缓打开，露出的是渚薰。我只来得及瞥他一眼，看起来他还在工作状态，穿着一条灰色西裤，一件白色衬衫和橙色领带。在我与他目光相接之前，这一切是我所能看到的全部，随即他猛地后退，试图当着我的面把门关上。

As if expecting him to do that I place my foot in between the door and doorframe and I yelp out in pain as the door collides with my foot.  
仿佛预料到他会这么做，我将脚卡在门和门框之间，随着门撞到我的脚，我痛得叫出声来。

"Wait!" I manage to choke out through the pain, "I'm not... I'm not here to hurt you, you idiot!"  
"等等！" 我忍痛喊道，"我不是……我不是来伤害你的，你这个白痴！"

I realize angrily calling him an idiot might not be too persuasive as he continues to try to shut the door on me. He's strong and I consider withdrawing my foot, letting him shut the door and walking away. Unfortunately for my foot an older part of me has taken over and I'm not willing to let him win.  
我意识到愤怒地叫他白痴可能不太有说服力，因为他继续试图把门关上。他很强壮，我考虑收回脚，让他关门然后走开。不幸的是，我内心深处的一部分已经占据了主导，我不愿意让他赢。

I lean myself up against the door and look around the corridor hoping that no one else here can hear this exchange or comes out right now. The last thing I need is for someone to see me doing this. I push against the door, "Listen to me! I'm not... I'm here to deliver that damn letter you dropped yesterday!"  
我靠在门上，环顾走廊，希望没有其他人能听到这段对话或现在出来。我最不希望的就是有人看到我这样做。我推着门，"听我说！我不是……我是来送你昨天掉的那封该死的信的！"

My words seem to have had some effect on him as I feel the force stop from his end, something my poor right foot is very grateful for. I stay exactly where I am not pushing on the door anymore but keeping it propped open. I'm sure I can hear him take a step away from me before I hear a weak voice, "Could... Could you please post it and leave?"  
我的话似乎对他产生了些许影响，我感觉到他那边的力道停止了，这让我的右脚感到十分庆幸。我保持原位不动，不再推门，只是让它保持敞开。我确信我能听到他后退一步的声音，然后是一个微弱的声音传来，“能……能请你贴好并离开吗？”

This is really the Fifth Child and final Angel? The one who nearly doomed all of mankind? This is the person who made Rei so angry just by seeing his name? I consider his request, maybe I should just leave him alone but again I feel that compulsion to find out more. I want to know why he is so terrified.  
这真的是第五使徒，也是最后的使徒吗？那个几乎让全人类陷入绝境的存在？就是这个人，仅仅因为他的名字就让绫波如此愤怒？我考虑着他的请求，也许我应该让他独自一人，但那种探究更多的冲动再次涌现。我想知道他为何如此恐惧。

I push the door slightly and I see him stood on the far side of the corridor his eyes wide with fear. He backs himself up into the corner like some sort of frightened puppy. I hesitate to move any closer and feel my own heart rate increase. I'm really having this effect on him, I'm really scaring him this much because of this aren't I? I should leave, I should never have come here at all.  
我轻轻推开门，看到他站在走廊的另一端，眼中满是恐惧。他像一只受惊的小狗一样退到角落。我犹豫着是否再靠近，感到自己的心跳也在加速。我真的对他有这么大的影响吗？我真的让他如此害怕，这都是因为我，对吧？我应该离开，我根本就不该来这里。

I stand there awkwardly in the doorway before repeating, "I'm not here to hurt you."  
我尴尬地站在门口，然后重复道：“我不是来伤害你的。”

He looks at me with a look of disbelief and I take a step back. His eyes... they're the same eyes I had seen from another certain person in the past. That fear of the monster I am, does Kaworu know about me then? Does he know what I was? Is that why he is so scared of me?  
他用一种难以置信的表情看着我，我后退了一步。他的眼睛……和我过去在某个特定人物身上见过的眼睛一模一样。我内心的怪物所带来的恐惧，碇真嗣知道我的事吗？他知道我是什么样的人吗？是不是因为这个他才这么怕我？

I weakly smile and hold out the envelope, "Here... Take it, I'll... I'll go. I'm sorry, I didn't realize I scared you that much."  
我虚弱地笑了笑，递出信封，“给……拿着吧，我……我会走的。对不起，我没意识到我吓到你了。”

Kaworu looks at me again before taking a tentative step forward. He slowly reaches out and takes the envelope from me before looking at the form within. I see his eyes light up for a moment and he half smiles at me.  
渚薰再次看向我，然后小心翼翼地向前迈了一步。他缓缓伸出手，从我这里接过信封，然后看向里面的表格。我看到他的眼睛亮了一下，然后对我露出了半个微笑。

"T-Thank you." He says as he takes a step back, "I... I appreciate you bringing this."  
“谢、谢谢你。”他说着后退了一步，“我……我很感激你带这个来。”

I shrug, "Yeah well... it was no big deal. Look I'll just go, I just thought... Never mind... You should probably look at getting that front door fixed too."  
我耸耸肩，“嗯，也没什么大不了的。瞧，我这就走了，我只是觉得……算了……你或许也该考虑修一下前门。”

I turn around to leave and hear him speak, "It is... a big deal to me... I am really grateful."  
我转身准备离开，听到他说：“这对我来说……很重要……我真的很感激。”

I freeze up, some communication finally, "Good."  
我愣住了，终于有了交流，“很好。”

I don't leave my spot in the door yet and wonder If he is about to say anything else. After thirty seconds of awkwardness he does, "I... I should apologize about yesterday... I hope... I did not hurt you..."  
我还没有离开门口的位置，心想他是否还要说些什么。三十秒的尴尬过后，他开口了：“我……我应该为昨天道歉……希望……我没有伤害到你……”

I finally turn around to face him, "It's fine... I just... Why did you run away from me?"  
我终于转过身面对他，“没事的……我只是……你为什么要从我身边逃走？”

He averts his eyes from me, I'm sure I see some redness of embarrassment come to his pale cheeks, "I… I thought you were going to hurt me… That you knew who I was… but you know that now don't you?"  
他避开了我的目光，我确信我看到他苍白的脸颊上泛起了尴尬的红晕，“我……我以为你要伤害我……以为你知道我是谁……但现在你知道了，对吧？”

I nod my head, "I didn't yesterday but I've had a few of the blanks filled in for me now."  
我点点头，“昨天我还不知道，但现在我已经填补了一些空白。”

He glances at me before backing himself up against the wall, "Then you know what I was and what it was I did?"  
他瞥了我一眼，然后背靠墙退后，“那么你知道我曾是怎样的人，以及我做过什么吗？”

I nod again, "Yes I do…"  
我再次点头，“是的，我知道……”

"How much do you know?"  
“你知道多少？”

"Enough. I know that you were sent to NERV to replace me and I know you ended up being an Angel." I tell him realizing there is no point beating around the bush, "I know that you befriended… "  
“够了。我知道你是被派来 NERV 取代我的，我也知道你最终成了使徒。”我告诉他，意识到拐弯抹角毫无意义，“我知道你和他成了朋友……”

I trail off for some reason finding myself unable to say his name. Kaworu is looking at me with a wounded expression, "I know that you hurt him too."  
我不知为何突然说不下去了，无法说出他的名字。渚薰看着我，脸上带着受伤的表情，“我知道你也伤害了他。”

He recoils at my words and shakes his head, "No it was not… I had no choice… I…"  
他听到我的话后退了一步，摇着头说，“不，不是那样的……我别无选择……我……”

He looks directly at me now, "It was too much… SEELE and the compulsions I felt I… I didn't want to hurt him. I didn't want to hurt anyone but…"  
他现在直视着我，“那太过分了……SEELE 和我感受到的强迫……我……我不想伤害他。我不想伤害任何人，但是……”

"But you did." “但你还是做了。”

"Yes… I did…" He admits, "And I regret it, I've regretted it every day since I returned… I should not be here… I should…"  
“是的……我做了……”他承认道，“而且我后悔了，自从我回来后，每一天都在后悔……我不该在这里……我应该……”

"Stop it." I order him not wishing to hear him say these things. It's not that I don't have sympathy for him but because those are the same words I've used countless times in the past about myself. I hate hearing them in my own head, never mind from someone else.  
"别说了。" 我不愿听他说这些，命令道。并非我对他没有同情，而是那些话我也曾无数次对自己说过。我讨厌在脑海中听到它们，更别提从别人口中听到。

I try to move the subject on, "So what are you now?"  
我试图转移话题，"那你现在是什么？"

"I'm as human as you or anyone else is." He answers me immediately. It was just as I suspected and the fear he is feeling starts to make sense. He's not only going to be afraid of me but everyone else. He doesn't have whatever powers he could rely on as an Angel to protect him and his human side has taken over.  
"我和你或其他人一样，都是人类。" 他立刻回答。正如我所料，他内心的恐惧开始变得合理。他不仅会害怕我，还会害怕所有人。他不再拥有作为天使时可依赖的任何力量，人类的特质已经占据主导。

An awkward silence falls upon us as I step further into the hallway, his front door closes extinguishing an amount of the light that was coming in. In the darkness I can still make him out and I can see his red eyes looking towards me reflecting the little light that is coming in from one of the other rooms. Finally he speaks, "W-Would you like to come inside?"  
我走进走廊，一阵尴尬的沉默随之降临。他的前门关闭，熄灭了部分透进来的光线。在黑暗中，我仍能辨认出他的身影，他的红眼睛朝我看来，反射着从其他房间透入的微弱光线。终于，他开口了，“你……你想进来吗？”

His question takes me by surprise and I find myself nodding and following him into his front room. His front room is immaculate, not surprising considering the total lack of anything in it. He has a simple black couch placed in one part of the room with a television opposite. A small coffee table sits in between the two.  
他的问题让我有些意外，我不由自主地点头，跟着他走进了客厅。他的客厅一尘不染，考虑到里面空无一物，这并不令人惊讶。房间的一角摆放着一张简单的黑色沙发，对面是一台电视机。两者之间放着一张小咖啡桌。

On one of the far walls is a small piano with a bookcase next to it filled up with what I presume to be music books. Next to that is a table with a music player on it. There is nothing else in the room, no plants, pictures or ornaments. The walls are a plain and dull white making it look as if he has just moved in here.  
在远处的墙边，有一架小钢琴，旁边是一个书架，里面塞满了我认为是乐谱的书。旁边还有一张桌子，上面放着一台音乐播放器。房间里再无其他物品，没有植物，没有照片，也没有装饰品。墙壁是单调乏味的白色，让人感觉他好像刚搬进来不久。

"How long have you been here?" I ask him.  
"你在这里多久了？" 我问他。

"Almost six months…" He replies, "I… returned in January and spent a month in the facility there."  
"差不多六个月了……" 他回答，"我……一月份回来的，在那里待了一个月。"

Six months here and this is all he has, even Rei didn't take that long to start amassing things. I wonder how Kaworu lives and what he does. He can't just sit and play piano all the time, he can't just listen to music all the time. Does he not have anything else?  
在这里六个月了，他只有这些，连丽都没花这么长时间就开始积攒东西。我想知道渚薰是怎么生活的，他都做些什么。他总不能一直坐着弹钢琴，也不能一直听音乐。他就没有别的事情做吗？

"So you came to Berlin after being in the facility, do you know people here?"  
“所以你离开设施后来了柏林，你在这里有认识的人吗？”

He shakes his head, "I… not really. It was Fuyutsuki… he offered me an opportunity here. I work for him, he's helped me a great deal."  
他摇摇头，“我……不太认识。是冬月……他给了我这里的机会。我为他工作，他帮了我很多。”

I don't know if I should be surprised at that. Fuyutsuki has, since we all returned been making an attempt to make up for what he was a part of. In the early days he visited each of us and ensured we got fair treatment and suitable payouts and support for what we all went through. I can imagine that he is also behind ensuring those people still watch over me, despite me saying I wanted nothing to do with any of them.  
我不知道这是否该让我惊讶。自从我们回来后，冬月一直在努力弥补他所参与的事情。起初，他拜访了我们每一个人，确保我们得到了公正的待遇和适当的补偿，以及对我们经历的支持。我能想象他也在幕后确保那些人继续关注我，尽管我说过不想和他们有任何瓜葛。”

"Fuyutsuki huh? So he is still trying to help people is he… even if they used to be an Angel…"  
"冬月啊？看来他还是在尽力帮助人们，即便他们曾经是天使……"

I feel bad almost immediately after saying it, even more so when I see him flinch, "He has… been very helpful and kind to me."  
我几乎立刻就感到内疚，尤其是看到他退缩的样子，“他……对我非常友好和热心。”

"Good. I'm glad." I state flatly before taking another look around this barren and somewhat alien room. It unnerves me, it's so sterile and basic. It doesn't feel lived in at all.  
"那就好。我很高兴。"我平淡地说道，然后再次环顾这个荒凉且略显异样的房间。它让我感到不安，如此无菌和简陋，完全没有生活气息。

"Thank you once again… for bringing the form I mean. It is… It is really important to me."  
"再次感谢你……我是说，把表格带给我。这对我……真的很重要。"

I shrug, "Don't mention it, so what exactly is it anyway that's so important?"  
我耸耸肩，"别客气，那到底是什么事情这么重要？"

"I am applying to become a music tutor." He wanders over to his piano and smiles, "As you have probably noticed I don't have much here. I… don't really know how to live yet, most of my life was spent in isolation with minimal contact with other people. Music is… one thing I have always had though and playing the piano is one thing I am able to do and I would like to share my gift with others."  
"我正在申请成为一名音乐导师。"他走到钢琴旁，微笑着说，"你可能已经注意到了，我这里没什么东西。我……还不太会生活，大部分时间我都是独自一人，很少与他人接触。音乐……是我一直拥有的东西，弹钢琴是我能做到的事情之一，我想把这份天赋分享给其他人。"

At least he knows what he wants, that is something. I walk over to his piano and take a look at it with him. It's a nice looking instrument but the thing that really catches my eye is the piece that he has displayed on the stand. I have to do a double take, "You're learning Firth of Fifth?"  
"至少他知道自己想要什么，这已经很难得了。我走到他的钢琴旁，和他一起端详起来。这架钢琴外观很漂亮，但真正吸引我目光的是他放在谱架上的那首曲子。我不得不再次确认，“你在学《五度峡湾》？””

He smiles at me, "You know the song?"  
"他朝我微笑，“你知道这首歌？””

I grin, "Of course I know it! It was one of my…"  
"我咧嘴一笑，“当然知道！它曾是我……””

I trail off partway through my sentence and shake my head. I don't really want to explain to this guy I barely know just why that sort of music resonates with me. I used to tell people it's because it was music for smarter people, that the musical complexity was made for people like me and the lyrical depth was something you wouldn't get in their simpler forms of music.  
我话说到一半就停了下来，摇了摇头。我并不想向这个几乎不认识的家伙解释为什么那种音乐会触动我。我曾告诉别人，那是因为这种音乐是为更聪明的人准备的，其音乐复杂性是为我这样的人量身定做，而歌词的深度是他们在更简单的音乐形式中所找不到的。

It was of course all bullshit. The real reason I know and like this song and this sort of music is because my mother liked it. One of the few things I have left of her is her record collection. I would listen to the songs repeatedly, absorbed in the stories they tell and the musical journeys they took me on. It was one of the few things that allowed me to get close to my mother. He looks at me expecting me to finish my sentence, instead I smirk at him, "Play it."  
当然，这一切都是胡说。我之所以知道并喜欢这首歌和这种音乐，真正的原因是我母亲喜欢它。我母亲留下的少数几样东西之一就是她的唱片收藏。我会反复聆听这些歌曲，沉浸在它们讲述的故事和带我踏上的音乐旅程中。这是让我接近母亲的少数几件事之一。他看着我，期待我完成句子，而我却对他微微一笑，"放吧。"

"Play… Firth of Fifth?" "放……《Firth of Fifth》？"

"Yes! Play it! I want to hear you!"  
"好啊！弹吧！我想听你弹！"

"O-Oh but I…" "哦-哦，但我…"

"Oh come on." I challenge him, "You want to be a tutor right? You have to get used to having an audience."  
"哎呀，别这样。" 我向他挑战，"你想当家教对吧？你得习惯有观众。"

"Okay… I shall try…" “好的…我试试…”

I step away from the piano and he takes his seat and looks over the sheet a couple of times. I watch as he stretches his hands out and I watch as his hands hover over the piano keys for a moment. I wonder if he is really going to do it, he seems hesitant but then he nods his head four times and his slender pale fingers come down on the keys launching into the wondrous introduction of the song.  
我离开钢琴，他坐下，几次翻看乐谱。我看着他伸展双手，然后悬停在琴键上方片刻。我好奇他是否真的会弹，他似乎有些犹豫，但随后他点了四次头，纤细苍白的手指落在琴键上，奏出了乐曲美妙的引子。

I remain still, my mouth slightly open in awe as he plays the entire introduction to the song flawlessly. I look and see his face deep in concentration as his hands glide across the piano. It's such a far cry from that frightened puppy of a boy I had witnessed only moments ago. A minute and some later he brings it to an end and I give him some light applause, "Very good."  
我静静地站着，惊讶得微微张嘴，他完美无瑕地弹完了整段引子。我看着他专注的脸庞，双手在钢琴上流畅地移动。这与片刻前那个惊慌失措的男孩判若两人。一分钟后，他结束了演奏，我轻轻鼓掌，“非常好。”

"Y-You think so?" He looks embarrassed by the praise.  
"你-你这么认为吗？" 他对这番赞扬显得有些不好意思。

"Of course! So you like this sort of music?"  
"当然！那你喜欢这种音乐吗？"

He nods enthusiastically, "Very much so, I just find it a shame that many of these artists are no longer active. I have exhausted a lot of their discographies."  
他热情地点头，"非常喜欢，我只是觉得遗憾的是，许多这些艺术家已经不再活跃了。我已经听遍了他们很多专辑。"

I laugh, "Well a lot of those bands were quite turbulent or they changes drastically."  
我笑着说：“很多乐队都经历过动荡或剧变。”

"Yes, this one was no exception, two of their members leaving only a few years apart and their sound changing. Tell me, which era do you prefer?"  
“是的，这个乐队也不例外，两位成员在短短几年内相继离开，风格也发生了变化。告诉我，你更喜欢哪个时期的他们？”

I shrug, "I like both, sometimes I found the earlier stuff a bit too wordy but sometimes the later stuff could be a bit too poppy or droning. There is a lot to like from both sides though."  
我耸耸肩，“两个时期我都喜欢，有时候觉得早期的作品过于冗长，但有时候后期的作品又可能过于流行化或单调。不过两边都有很多值得喜欢的地方。”

"I see, I admit I find myself preferring the older material but later tracks such as Domino, Home by the Sea and Fading Lights are wonderful."  
"我明白了，我得承认我个人更喜欢早期的作品，但后来的曲目如《多米诺》、《海边之家》和《渐暗之光》也非常精彩。"

"They are." I reply and then I'm hit by a strange idea.  
"确实如此。" 我回答道，随即脑海中闪过一个奇怪的念头。"

"Say… Kaworu there is… a band playing nearby tonight… a tribute act funnily enough and they cover only the earlier material. I have two tickets for it and I was going to go with a friend but she unfortunately had to leave to go home earlier today."  
"这么说吧，卡沃鲁，今晚附近有一支乐队演出……说来有趣，这是一支致敬乐队，他们只演奏早期的作品。我有两张票，原本打算和朋友一起去，但她不幸今天早些时候回家了。"

He looks at me, "Oh… That is unfortunate."  
他看着我，“哦……那真是遗憾。”

I can't help but think that for Kaworu it's actually quite fortunate considering just what it is Rei wants to do to him. I probably shouldn't mention Rei right now, a part of me thinks I shouldn't even be doing this but something inside me feels bad for the guy. He's been here six months and it's obvious he hasn't experienced… anything. Going to a concert will be good for him and he'll have me to protect him from anything.  
我不禁想到，对渚来说，这其实相当幸运，考虑到丽想要对他做什么。我或许现在不该提丽，一部分的我甚至觉得我不该做这件事，但内心深处，我为这家伙感到难过。他在这里已经六个月了，显然他什么都没经历过……去听一场音乐会对他有好处，而且有我在，可以保护他免受任何事情的干扰。

"So would you like the spare ticket?"  
“那么，你想不想要这张多余的票？”

"I-I do not know… I… there will be many people there… I…"  
"我…我不知道…我…那里会有很多人…我…"

"You have nothing to worry about, no one knows who you are and besides you're going to be with me. I'll make sure no harm comes to you."  
"你不用担心，没人知道你是谁，而且你还会和我在一起。我会确保你不会受到任何伤害。"

He smiles, "In which case… I would like that… thank you."  
他微笑着说："那么…我很愿意…谢谢你。"

### Chapter 4: Mr Blue Sky?  
第四章：蓝天先生？  

**Rei Ayanami 绫波零**

**Tokyo-2 – Morning 东京-2 —— 清晨**

I step through into the arrivals lounge, my backpack feels heavy on my shoulders and I'm wheeling my pale blue case behind me as I look around for Misato. A group of people move past me, rushing towards their loved ones or just taxi drivers waiting to pick them up as I try to spot her purple hair through the semi busy terminal. I move forward and before long I can hear her excitedly yelling my name.  
我穿过通道进入到达大厅，背包沉甸甸地压在肩上，我拖着淡蓝色的行李箱四处寻找美里。一群人从我身边匆匆走过，有的奔向心爱的家人，有的则是等待接客的出租车司机，我试图在半忙碌的航站楼中寻找她那紫色的头发。我向前走去，不久便听到她兴奋地喊我的名字。

"Rei!" “丽！”

I glance upwards and smile as I finally catch sight of my adoptive mother. She quickly moved towards me and nearly knocks me off my feet as she pulls me into a tight embrace, "How was your flight?"  
我抬头望去，终于看到了我的养母，脸上露出微笑。她迅速向我走来，紧紧拥抱我，几乎让我站不稳，“飞行怎么样？”

"It was pleasant, although I do not think you should have gone to all the effort to arranging all of that for me. I would have been happy to have done it myself."  
"虽然我觉得你不该费心为我安排这一切，我自己也能搞定，但这种感觉确实不错。"

She breaks the hug and shakes her head, "It wouldn't have been fair to expect you to do it yourself considering I was the one who asked you to come back so suddenly. Besides it wasn't me who arranged your upgrades."  
她松开拥抱，摇了摇头，"考虑到是我突然叫你回来的，让你自己安排就不太公平了。而且，给你升级的事也不是我安排的。"

I raise an eyebrow out of curiosity, "Who was it?"  
我好奇地挑了挑眉，"那是谁？"

"Fuyutsuki, after I informed him of what had happened and said you were on your way back he pulled some strings."  
"冬月，我告诉他发生的事情后，他说你正在回来，于是他动用了一些关系。"

"I see, in which case I shall have to think him if I encounter him." I frown in my reply, my business class experience somewhat soured by the knowledge of who arranged it. If I had known it was he who arranged that I would have asked to remain in economy class.  
"我明白了，那样的话我得感谢他，如果遇到他的话。" 我皱着眉头回答，我的商务舱体验因为知道是谁安排的而有些变味。如果早知道是他安排的，我可能会要求留在经济舱。

I am not by any means ungrateful for the experience. I am thankful, I found the seating to be far more comfortable than economy and the ability to turn them into an actual bed meant I was able to sleep on the flight. In addition the vegetarian options offered to me on the menu were many.  
我绝不是不感激这次经历。我很感激，我发现座位比经济舱舒适得多，而且能够变成真正的床，这意味着我可以在飞行中睡觉。此外，菜单上提供的素食选项也很多。

Still, it also means Fuyutsuki did me a favour and he is someone I do not wish to speak to. It is something I share with Asuka, we both desire distance from that person but for differing reasons. She because she wishes to cut off all contact with that part of her life, me because of what that man reminds me of and what I used to be.  
尽管如此，这也意味着冬月帮了我一个忙，而我并不想与他交谈。这是我与明日香共有的感受，我们都希望远离那个人，但原因各异。她是因为想要切断与那段生活的所有联系，而我则是因为那个人让我想起过去的自己。

I am of a similar opinion when it comes to Ritsuko Akagi too, something which I know upsets Misato and even Shinji. I know the two of them wish to move on and I will make the effort when necessary. I do not dislike Fuyutsuki or Akagi, I just wish to maintain distance from them.  
对于赤木律子，我的看法也类似，我知道这让美里和真嗣感到不安。我知道他们俩希望向前看，必要时我会努力配合。我并不讨厌冬月或赤木，只是希望与他们保持距离。

We finally reach Misato's car and she takes my case and backpack from me and places it in the boot. She eyes my backpack curiously and I can already guess at what she is thinking. I simply shake my head at her, "Yes I did buy you both souvenirs and you can find out what they are later."  
我们终于到达美里的车旁，她从我手中接过手提箱和背包，放入后备箱。她好奇地打量着我的背包，我已猜到她在想什么。我只是对她摇摇头，“是的，我给你们俩买了纪念品，你们稍后就会知道是什么了。”

She nods and grins at me, "Well that's something to look forward to!"  
她点点头，对我咧嘴一笑，“嗯，那倒是值得期待的事！”

I climb into the car and put my seatbelt on, she climbs into her side and a few moments later we're leaving the carpark and moving back towards the city and to our apartment. The first part of our journey is silent and so I take the opportunity to speak to Misato about what has happened.  
我爬进车里，系好安全带，她坐到她的位置上，片刻后我们驶离停车场，朝着城市和我们的公寓方向返回。旅程的前半段我们沉默无言，于是我趁机向美里询问发生了什么。

"I presume it was you who contacted Fuyutsuki to ask about Nagisa?"  
“我猜是你联系了冬月，询问了关于渚的事吧？”

Misato nods her head, "Yeah, he already knew about Nagisa."  
美里点点头，“嗯，他已经知道渚的事了。”

"How?" I lean my elbow on the edge of the window and prop my head up on my hand looking outside at the buildings we pass. So Fuyutsuki already knew about Nagisa but failed to inform any of us.  
“怎么知道的？”我把手肘撑在窗边，用手托着头，望着窗外掠过的建筑。原来副校长早就知道渚的事，却没告诉我们任何人。

"Seems Nagisa returned at the start of the year. They picked him up at the emergence facility and treated him initially for emergence sickness. Apparently he was… in quite a state when he recovered his memories."  
“看来渚是在年初回来的。他们在紧急设施找到了他，并初步治疗了他的觉醒症状。显然，当他恢复记忆时……状态相当糟糕。”

I scowl at hearing Misato's words and I can't tell if she is feeling some sort of sympathy for what Kaworu has went through. I'm not sure I feel sympathetic at all, in the back of my mind all I can hear is a voice saying 'good.' I keep that voice away though, I don't like  
听到美里的话，我皱起了眉头，不确定她是否对渚所经历的一切感到同情。我内心深处并不觉得有什么值得同情的，只有一个声音在说‘活该’。但我尽量压制这个声音，我不喜欢……

"It seems…" Misato pauses, "That Nagisa is no longer an Angel. They ran tests whilst he was there and he is completely human now."  
“看来……”美里顿了顿，“渚已经不再是天使了。他们在那里对他进行了测试，他现在完全是个普通人。”

"I see…" My frown deepens and I wonder if this fact should make me feel any better about the fact that he is out there walking around freely. Regardless of whether he is human now or not it was what he was and what he did that concerns me. He was an Angel, he tried to destroy this world and he broke my brother's heart. He manipulated him when he was at his lowest point and tore his world apart.  
“我明白了……”我的眉头皱得更深了，不知道这个事实是否应该让我对他能自由行走感到好受些。不管他现在是不是人类，让我担忧的是他曾经的身份和所做的事。他曾是天使，试图毁灭这个世界，还伤了我哥哥的心。他在哥哥最脆弱的时候操纵了他，将他的世界撕得粉碎。

The fact that he is just walking around freely angers me. He should not be allowed to do so, I know we have all done bad things in the past, we all made mistakes but what he did was no mistake.  
他竟然能自由自在地四处走动，这让我非常愤怒。他不应该被允许这样做，我知道我们过去都做过坏事，我们都犯过错误，但他所做的绝非错误。

"Why did they let him go? He was an Angel, he tried…"  
“他们为什么放他走？他曾是天使，他尝试过……”

"I asked Fuyutsuki this. It seems that he was let go because Fuyutsuki offered him a job. Fuyutsuki saw him as a victim of what had happened and offered to help him."  
“我问过冬月这件事。似乎是因为冬月给了他一份工作，他才被放走的。冬月认为他是所发生事件的受害者，并提出帮助他。”

"Kaworu Nagisa is no victim, he is a monster." I state flatly and look at Misato. She too is frowning and I imagine she has very similar thoughts to me.  
"渚薰并非受害者，他是个怪物。" 我平淡地说道，看向美里。她也皱着眉头，我想她的想法应该和我差不多。

"Fuyutsuki didn't seem to think so and… urged us to let the thing with Nagisa slide." Misato shakes her head as she speaks, "He didn't go into detail but he told me that Nagisa is as much a victim as you, Shinji or Asuka."  
"冬月似乎不这么认为，而且……他劝我们放过和渚薰有关的事。" 美里边说边摇头，"他没有详细说明，但他告诉我，渚薰和你、真嗣或明日香一样，都是受害者。"

"I doubt that." "我对此表示怀疑。"

"As do I but he said he can provide proof for us should we need it. He also assured me that there will be absolutely no risk to anyone and no one will see or hear from Nagisa should we desire it."  
“我也一样，但他表示可以为我们提供证据，如果我们需要的话。他还向我保证，绝对不会有任何人面临风险，如果我们希望的话，没有人会再见到或听到 Nagisa 的消息。”

I start to open my mouth to say something about the risk to Asuka but I quickly stop myself. I cannot break my promise to her but I also don't want her to be at risk. She is in the same city as Nagisa, she has already encountered him once and it can happen again. Her wish to have no contact with others and for no one else to know her whereabouts can be so frustrating at times but I will continue to respect that wish.  
我正要开口说关于 Asuka 的风险，但很快制止了自己。我不能违背对她的承诺，但也不想让她处于危险之中。她和 Nagisa 在同一个城市，她已经遇到过他一次，这种事可能还会发生。她希望不与他人接触，不让任何人知道她的行踪，这有时让人很沮丧，但我会继续尊重她的这个愿望。

My only hope is that she is okay, I will make sure to contact her later today to let her know I have arrived back in Japan. I do wish that I could have stayed with her for another night or two. It has been so long since I have seen her, I wished to play games or see a move with her but she insisted I returned to Japan when Misato asked me to. I believe she will be alright though, the chances of her encountering Nagisa again are slim.  
我唯一的希望是她一切安好，今天晚些时候我会联系她，告诉她我已经回到日本。我真希望能在她身边多待一两个晚上。我已经很久没见到她了，本想和她一起玩游戏或看电影，但她坚持让我在 Misato 要求我回来时返回日本。不过我相信她会没事的，她再次遇到 Nagisa 的几率很小。

Asuka is smart and strong, I'm sure she will be alright. So now my attention turns towards my brother Shinji. I wonder how he would react to such news, I look back at Misato, "Have you informed Shinji?"  
明日香既聪明又坚强，我相信她会没事的。现在，我的注意力转向了我的弟弟真嗣。我不知道他听到这样的消息会有什么反应，我回头看向美里，“你通知真嗣了吗？”

Misato shakes her head, "No… Not yet. I don't know if I should tell him or if I'm able to. I don't know how he would react to something like this, you know how he feels about Nagisa…"  
美里摇了摇头，“还没有……我还没说。我不知道该不该告诉他，也不知道我能不能做到。我不清楚他对此会有什么反应，你知道他对渚的感情……”

"Yes I do." “是的，我知道。”

Figuring out exactly how my brother will react is tough. He will of course be shocked by the news at first, I am not entirely sure if he is aware that Nagisa was very much like myself with the potential for spare bodies. I wonder if the news that Nagisa is alive might alleviate some of the guilt he still feels over the Angels' death. At the same time I wonder if that might not just give him something else to fear in this world.  
准确揣摩我哥哥的反应确实不易。他初闻消息自然会震惊，我不确定他是否知晓渚其实和我一样，拥有备份身体的可能性。我在想，得知渚还活着的消息能否减轻他因天使之死而背负的愧疚。但同时，我也担心这会不会只是让他在这个世界上又多了一样恐惧的东西。

"I think we should be honest with him thought." Misato says to me, "I think Shinji deserves honesty, if we hide the truth then… it might only make things worse should he eventually find out anyway."  
“我认为我们应该对他坦诚。”美里对我说，“我觉得真嗣应该得到诚实，如果我们隐瞒真相，万一他最终还是发现了……那只会让情况变得更糟。”

I nod, "I agree. It would be best to be honest, he should know."  
我点头，“我同意。最好还是诚实相告，他应该知道。”

I go back to staring out the window knowing the hypocrisy of my own words. Knowing that Asuka is well and safe and happy, I wonder what effect that would have on Shinji. I can still remember how miserable he was on the day she left, we were all unhappy with it. She left without any warning only leaving a simple message behind that she had returned to Germany and thanking Misato for taking care of her.  
我回到窗前，凝视着外面，深知自己话语中的虚伪。知道明日香安然无恙、幸福快乐，我不禁思索这对真嗣会有何影响。我仍记得她离开那天，他有多么痛苦，我们所有人都为此感到难过。她毫无预兆地离去，只留下一条简短的讯息，说她已返回德国，并感谢美里对她的照顾。

I did not understand why she had left then and I still don't understand. It was one of the first things I asked when I tracked her down and found her and her only answer was that she had to. I disagree with her, I do not think she had to but it was and is her decision. All I can do is respect that and her wishes. Still I do dislike keeping this secret from Shinji and Misato, yet it is the price of mine and Asuka's friendship, a friendship that I value so very much.  
那时我不明白她为何离开，至今依然不解。这是我找到她后问的第一个问题，而她的唯一回答是她必须这么做。我不同意她的看法，我认为她并非必须离开，但这是她的决定，过去是，现在是。我能做的只有尊重这一点和她的一切愿望。尽管如此，我仍不喜欢对真嗣和美里隐瞒这个秘密，然而这是我和明日香友谊的代价，这份友谊对我来说无比珍贵。

Being human is exhausting I think to myself as I feel my eyes start to grow heavier. The days of travelling and the revelations are starting to get to me despite me sleeping on the flight. I am looking forward to returning home where I can take a shower, where I can relax in my pyjamas and I can see my brother. Where I can sample his delicious cooking and I can feel safe and unafraid.  
作为人类真是累人，我心里想着，感觉眼皮开始变得沉重。尽管在飞机上睡了一觉，但连日的旅行和那些惊人的发现开始让我感到疲惫。我期待着回家，在那里我可以洗个澡，穿上睡衣放松，还能见到我的哥哥。在那里，我可以品尝他美味的烹饪，感到安全和无所畏惧。

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

**Berlin - Morning 柏林 - 清晨**

My eyes slowly open and the first thing I notice in my semi awake state is the strange pain I'm feeling in my neck. This is closely followed by a dull pain in my head and the realization that this thing my head is against is a solid object rather than my comfortable pillows. The thing wrapped halfway around my body is not my large duvet but is instead a thinner sheet that would be providing me with warmth were it not for it being on the floor now.  
我的眼睛缓缓睁开，半醒状态下首先注意到的是脖子上的奇怪疼痛。紧接着是头部的隐隐作痛，以及意识到我的头正靠在一个坚硬的物体上，而不是我舒适的枕头。缠绕在我身体一半的东西不是我那张大被子，而是一条较薄的床单，如果不是它现在掉在了地上，本该给我带来温暖的。

I force my eyes to fully open and find myself now looking up at an unfamiliar ceiling. I blink a couple of times and wonder if maybe this is some sort of strange dream I'll wake up from. I pause for a moment, that is strange, I don't remember my dreams from last night. I'm not exactly comfortable here but I also seemed to have slept well for the first time.  
我强迫自己完全睁开眼睛，发现自己正仰望着一个陌生的天花板。我眨了几下眼，疑惑这会不会是一场奇怪的梦，醒来就会消失。我停顿片刻，这很奇怪，我不记得昨晚的梦了。虽然这里并不舒适，但我似乎睡得很好，这是第一次。

This pleasant feeling doesn't last long as the realization of where I am suddenly hits me. It's immediately followed by the familiar feelings of fear that I'm so used to by now. I can remember what happened now. I know exactly where I am now and why I am lying on this sofa on what was, until yesterday, a stranger's home.  
这种愉悦的感觉并没有持续多久，因为我突然意识到自己在哪里。紧接着，我习惯了的恐惧感立刻袭来。我现在能记起发生了什么。我清楚地知道自己在哪里，以及为什么躺在这个沙发上，而这个沙发直到昨天还属于一个陌生人的家。

Last night she... She invited me to that concert and it was such a wondrous experience. I don't think my heart has ever experienced such joy before. To witness those people playing that music, music I have come to enjoy and love so perfectly was a sight to behold and will surely be one of my most treasured memories.  
昨晚她……她邀请我去那场音乐会，那是一次如此美妙的体验。我想我的心从未感受过如此的喜悦。亲眼目睹那些人演奏那美妙的音乐，那是我逐渐喜爱并深爱的音乐，真是令人难忘的景象，必将是我最珍贵的记忆之一。

We left the concert and Asuka asked if I would like to go for a drink with her. I politely declined at first but she insisted upon it. I was uncertain of it, fearful of what would happen if I drank alcohol. I am vaguely aware from the actions I have heard on evenings and the... mess that once littered the pavement near my home of the effect it can have on people.  
我们离开了音乐会，明日香问我是否愿意和她一起去喝一杯。我起初礼貌地拒绝了，但她坚持要我去。我对喝酒这件事感到不确定，害怕酒精会带来的后果。我隐约知道，从我听说的那些夜晚的举动和...我家附近曾经散落一地的混乱，酒精对人的影响有多大。

I think she knew I was scared though and she promised to look after me. I had enjoyed her company throughout the night so decided to take her up on her offer. It would not hurt to try a new experience. The place she took me to was small and quiet. I don't know her very well yet but I felt like we had something in common, I felt like the pain and fear that I feel is something she is familiar with.  
我想她知道我害怕，但她承诺会照顾我。那一晚我享受了她的陪伴，所以决定接受她的提议。尝试一种新的体验并不会有什么坏处。她带我去的地方很小也很安静。我虽然对她了解不多，但感觉我们有些共同之处，我觉得我所感受到的痛苦和恐惧，她也很熟悉。

Whilst there I drank two and a half pints of beer, much to Asuka's amusement that was enough to affect me. I was giddy, very happy but incapable of walking in a straight line. Asuka laughed me me, I laughed at myself. I haven't laughed like that before, I haven't felt joy like this before.  
在那里，我喝了两大杯半的啤酒，这让明日香觉得很有趣，因为这已经足以让我受到影响。我感到非常开心，但走路却歪歪扭扭。明日香笑我，我也自嘲地笑了。我以前从未这样笑过，从未感受过这样的快乐。

Asuka on the other hand did not seem to be too affected by what it was she drank. I suppose she is more tolerant of it than I am but she did start to slur her words at one point. When it was time for us to leave the small pub, she declared that I was of course in no fit state to go to my apartment alone. That is why I am now here lying on the couch of Asuka Langley Soryu.  
另一方面，明日香似乎并没有受到她所喝东西的太大影响。我想她对这东西的耐受力比我强，但她确实在某一刻开始口齿不清。当我们离开那家小酒馆时，她宣称我当然不适合独自回公寓。这就是我现在躺在明日香·兰格雷沙发上的原因。

I gaze absent mindedly around the dimly lit room. This place is a far cry from my own and I now start to realize with some sadness just how alien I must seem to anyone else. I can understand now why she was looking around my own apartment so strangely. My place is... It's practically empty and devoid of any colour or life. Her place is decorated, it's messy but it is welcoming.  
我心不在焉地环顾着昏暗的房间。这个地方与我自己的住处相去甚远，我现在开始有些悲伤地意识到，我一定显得多么格格不入。我现在能理解为什么她在我自己的公寓里四处张望时那么奇怪了。我的地方……几乎空无一物，缺乏任何色彩或生机。她的地方装饰着，虽然凌乱但很温馨。

Ahead of me I spot a television set and an array of games consoles set up underneath it. Either side of the television are two tall bookcases filled with books, DVDs and video games. Between myself and the television is a small coffee table, there is a used plate on it, some empty cups and a half-read book.  
我面前有一台电视机和一系列游戏机设置在它下面。电视两侧是两个高大的书架，里面塞满了书籍、DVD 和视频游戏。在我和电视机之间有一个小咖啡桌，上面有一个用过的盘子，一些空杯子，还有一本半读的书。

Is this how a real human actually lives? Is this what a true lived-in home looks and feels like? Since I returned I've always been hyper aware of just how alien I must seem to others. My way of speaking is not normal by anyone's standards and my appearance is a constant reminder of what I am and was.  
这就是人类真实的生活状态吗？一个真正充满生活气息的家，看起来和感觉起来就是这样的吗？自从我回来后，我一直异常清楚自己对他人来说是多么的异类。我的说话方式在任何人看来都不正常，我的外表也时刻提醒着我是谁，我曾经是什么。

I know so little of human ways and customs, I only know what was ingrained into me from my 'birth.' I have this new-found freedom but I find myself at a loss at what exactly to do with it. I am constantly intrigued by things but I don't know where I should start. Asuka's home is a reminded of that, I look again and I see at least three games consoles under her television. I would not know what to do with even one of them. I wouldn't know what to buy and why to buy it, I wouldn't know about the games I should play or what I would enjoy.  
我对人类的习俗和生活方式知之甚少，我只知道从我‘出生’时就被灌输的那点知识。我有了这新发现的自由，却发现自己不知道该如何利用它。我对许多事物都充满好奇，但不知道该从何开始。明日香的家让我想起了这一点，我再次环顾四周，发现她的电视机下至少有三台游戏主机。我甚至不知道该如何使用其中一台。我不知道该买什么，为什么要买，也不知道该玩哪些游戏，或者我会喜欢什么。

All I have really is my job and my music. My music I have because it was something ingrained into me and Kodama helped me explore more contemporary artists. My job because of Fuyutsuki, even the music tuition I want to do I had to be guided into.  
我真正拥有的只有我的工作和我的音乐。我的音乐是因为它被灌输给我，而 Kodama 帮助我探索了更多当代艺术家。我的工作是因为 Fuyutsuki，甚至连我想做的音乐课程，也必须有人引导我进入。

I slowly start to sit up and I let the sheet fully fall to the floor. I look across to a nearby chair and see the clothes I was wearing yesterday neatly folded up for me. I begin to feel my cheeks glow slightly red at my situation. It is strange but in my past life I did not feel much in the way of embarrassment when it came to my body but in my past life I never woke up in only my underwear in a stranger's home.  
我缓缓坐起身，任由床单完全滑落到地板上。我环顾四周，看到不远处的椅子上整齐地叠放着我昨天穿的衣服。我的脸颊不由自主地微微泛红，感到有些尴尬。这种感觉很奇怪，因为在我的前世，我对于自己的身体并没有太多羞涩之情，但前世的我从未在陌生人家中醒来时只穿着内衣。

Also, in my past life I never had to deal with certain urges that come with being human. That is... admittedly something I am still struggling with. It is not that I do not know how nor is it not that dealing with certain urges doesn't feel good it is just something I am unused to and something I struggle to not feel embarrassed or awkward about.  
此外，在前世，我从未需要应对作为人类特有的某些冲动。这一点……坦白说，我仍在努力适应。并非我不知道如何处理，也不是说应对这些冲动感觉不好，只是我还不习惯，而且我很难不感到尴尬或局促。

I pull the sheet back up and around my waist as I continue to look around the room. Despite being so visually different to my own apartment the layout is not too dissimilar. On the far end of a wall are two doors, I can see from here one of which leads into a bathroom and the other, closed, door I presume leads to Asuka's bedroom.  
我将床单重新拉起，围在腰间，继续打量着房间。尽管这里的视觉风格与我的公寓大相径庭，但布局却颇为相似。在远端的一堵墙上，有两扇门，从这里可以看到其中一扇通向浴室，而另一扇紧闭的门，我猜是通往明日香卧室的。

Much like my apartment the living room is also combined with a kitchen at the far end. Hers seems slightly larger than mine though. I look towards the closed door and I wonder how Asuka is and if she also slept well last night.  
和我的公寓一样，客厅的尽头也与厨房相连。不过她的似乎比我的稍大一些。我望向那扇紧闭的门，心中好奇明日香现在怎么样了，昨晚是否也睡得安稳。

I am still coming to terms with the fact that I am here. After our initial encounter I did not think that I would ever see her again, nor did I think it would be such a pleasant experience. I was certain that I did not deserve any of her kindness, in fact I am still certain that I don't. I cannot comprehend why she would be so nice to be especially now that she knows the truth of what I am. Yet I am grateful to her for it. When she wakes up I will have to thank her, whenever of course it is that she does wake up.  
我仍在努力接受自己身处此地的事实。初次相遇后，我从未想过会再次见到她，更没想到这会是一次愉快的经历。我确信自己不配得到她的任何善意，事实上，我现在依然这么认为。我无法理解她为何会对我如此友善，尤其是在她知道我的真实身份之后。然而，我对此心怀感激。等她醒来，我必须向她道谢，当然，是在她醒来的那一刻。

I reach across to the seat and grab my phone from the top of the pile. I smile as I turn it on and look at the time and see that it's nine thirty. I smile and lean back comfortably on the sofa. A second later my smile fades and I look at the phone again... Oh my god it's nine thirty! I should be at work now! I should have been at work half an hour ago! I should be at work but I'm not! I'm in the apartment of someone I barely know, wearing barely anything in a part of Berlin that I barely know!  
我伸手越过座位，从那堆东西上面抓起手机。我笑着打开它，看了看时间，发现已经是九点半了。我微笑着舒适地靠在沙发上。但一秒钟后，我的笑容消失了，我又看了一眼手机……天哪，九点半了！我现在应该在上班！我半小时前就应该在上班了！我应该在上班但我不在！我在这位几乎不认识的人的公寓里，穿着几乎没穿什么，在柏林一个我几乎不熟悉的地方！

I leap up off fo the couch, there is a loud band and pain as my toe hits the wooden coffee table. I suppress a yelp and lean over to pick up my trousers from the pile. How could this have happened? Did I sleep through my alarm? Why didn't it go off? Damnit, I wanted to put on fresh clothes as well!  
我从沙发上跳了起来，随着一声巨响和疼痛，我的脚趾撞到了木制咖啡桌上。我忍住了一声尖叫，弯腰从那堆东西里捡起我的裤子。这怎么可能发生？我是不是睡过了闹钟？为什么它没响？该死，我还想换上干净衣服呢！

I slide one leg into my trousers and try to put the other one in, no wait that isn't right. This isn't the right leg, damnit I'm trying to put these on the wrong way. I slide by leg back out of my trousers and take a step back to try to reassess this. There is another loud noise as once again my foot collides with the table, this time I can't suppress the yelp of pain.  
我把一条腿滑进裤子里，试图把另一条腿也放进去，不，等等，这样不对。这不是正确的腿，该死，我穿反了。我把腿从裤子里抽出来，后退一步，试图重新评估。又是一声巨响，我的脚再次撞到了桌子，这次我忍不住发出了一声痛苦的尖叫。

Nor can I keep my balance as I try to keep hold of the trousers and step into them. I feel them slip from my hands as I stagger backwards and try desperately to angle myself to land on the floor. My backside does not thank me as I land hard against the wooden floor.  
我也无法保持平衡，试图抓住裤子并迈进去。我感觉到它们从手中滑落，当我踉跄后退，拼命调整姿势以避免摔倒时。我的屁股并不感激我，因为我重重地摔在了木地板上。

I lie there for a brief moment dazed and in pain before getting back up and snatching my trousers off of the floor in anger. I hold them out properly and I'm ready to finally put the damn things on when I hear a door open and a light comes on in the room. All I can do is stand there awkwardly as I feel redness spread to my cheeks. I slowly turn my head to see a panicked looking Asuka staring directly at me.  
我在那里躺了一会儿，头晕目眩且疼痛，然后愤怒地从地板上抓起裤子。我正准备终于穿上这该死的东西时，听到门开了，房间里的灯也亮了。我只能尴尬地站在那里，感觉脸颊发红。我慢慢转过头，看到惊慌失措的明日香正直直地盯着我。

"Kaworu! Is everything alright I heard a-"  
“薰！一切都好吗？我听到有——”

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

**Berlin - Morning 柏林 - 清晨**

Admittedly of all the things I expected to see when I opened my bedroom door, Kaworu Nagisa stood angrily in just his underwear was at the bottom of the list, in fact I dare say it never even crossed my mind. It was strange enough having him in my apartment but to find him in this particular state even more so.  
说实话，当我打开卧室门时，我预想过无数可能的场景，但看到渚薰只穿着内裤站在那里生气，绝对是排在最底层的，甚至可以说我从未想过会有这种事。他在我的公寓里已经够奇怪了，但看到他这副模样更是让人难以置信。

Kaworu slowly turns his head and looks directly at me, I can see his eyes are wide with fear once again but at least this time I know it isn't because he's scared of me. Instead, judging by how red his face has gone it's probably because of the state I've spotted him in.  
渚薰缓缓转过头，直视着我，我能看到他的眼睛再次因恐惧而睁大，但至少这次我知道他不是因为我而害怕。相反，从他脸红的程度来看，可能是因为我看到了他这副模样。

I start to feel some redness come to my cheeks now as I realize we've been standing there looking at one another for at least thirty seconds now. I try to focus on his face as I speak, "I… heard a noise… is everything alright?"  
我开始感到脸颊泛红，意识到我们至少已经站在那里互相凝视了三十秒。我努力将注意力集中在他的脸上，开口问道：“我……听到了一些声响……一切都还好吗？”

His mouth opens and closes in a fashion similar to a goldfish and more awkward moments of silence pass between us. I'm trying so hard to keep me eyes on his face but I can't help but steal glances elsewhere. I look down at his body taking in the sight before me, he's slender but healthy and his pale skin almost glows in the light. I can see the top of his legs too, well toned, he did say that he likes to walk a lot.  
他的嘴巴张开又合上，动作像极了金鱼，更多尴尬的沉默在我们之间流逝。我拼命试图将目光锁定在他的脸上，但忍不住偷瞄其他地方。我低头看着他的身体，欣赏着眼前的景象，他身材修长却健康，苍白的皮肤在灯光下几乎闪着光。我还能看到他大腿的上部，肌肉线条分明，他确实说过自己喜欢多走路。

My eyes dart from his face to his legs, up to his chest and stomach. I'm doing all I can to not let them wander to other parts. I shouldn't be looking, I really shouldn't, and he's embarrassed enough but… I can't… my eyes look directly at the one covered part of him. His boxers are tight and I can see his rounded backside so well. I feel myself bite onto my bottom lip, it's… for lack of a better word, perfect.  
我的目光从他的脸游移到他的腿，再向上到他的胸膛和腹部。我竭尽全力不让视线飘向其他部位。我不该这样看，真的不该，而且他已经够尴尬了……但我无法……我的目光直直地落在他被遮盖的部分。他的内裤紧绷，我能清晰地看到他圆润的臀部。我感到自己咬住了下唇，找不到更好的词来形容，这真是……完美。

I really have to stop looking. I shouldn't be looking at his body like this. He's a guest in my home, he's a guest and practically a stranger. I… I have to stop, come on Asuka… if you want to look at… things you have websites for that.  
我真的不能再看了。我不应该这样盯着他的身体。他是住在我家的客人，是个客人，几乎是个陌生人。我……我得停下来，加油，明日香……如果你想看……那种东西，有专门的网站。

My eyes look at his ass once again. I hate myself for this but I guess one quick peek isn't bad, I mean… I am intrigued as to whether or not our former Angel is equipped and his boxers are tight. I allow my eyes to drift for just a second, I bite down harder on my lip.  
我的目光再次落在了他的臀部上。我讨厌自己这样，但我想，快速瞥一眼也没什么大不了的，我是说……我对我们曾经的使徒是否装备齐全以及他的内裤是否紧身感到好奇。我让我的目光飘移了一秒钟，咬紧了嘴唇。

"I… I tripped…" He finally speaks.  
“我……我绊倒了……”他终于开口说道。

My eyes go back up to his face and I release the painful grip my teeth have on my bottom lip. Instead I suppress a smirk as I realize what must have happened. The noise I heard was Kaworu falling. I can't help but wonder how.  
我的目光再次回到他的脸上，松开了紧咬下唇的疼痛。取而代之的是，我抑制住一个得意的微笑，因为我意识到发生了什么。我听到的声音是渚薰摔倒了。我不禁好奇他是怎么摔的。

"I was in a hurry, I… I fell when…"  
“我刚才很匆忙，我……我摔倒了……”

I nearly snort with laughter, now I can see the scene. Kaworu in a hurry to put on his trousers must have slipped and fallen. What a sight that must have been. All I can do is nod as I watch him put his trousers on, shame. He then hurriedly picks up his shirt and slips that on. I can't help but wonder why he is in such a rush, does he have to be somewhere? Is it to get away from me?  
我差点笑出声来，现在我能想象那个场景了。渚薰急着穿裤子，一定是滑倒了。那场面一定很滑稽。我只能点头，看着他穿上裤子，显得有些尴尬。然后他急忙拿起衬衫穿上。我不禁好奇他为什么这么匆忙，他要去哪里吗？是为了避开我吗？

I wonder if maybe last night was too much for him, he's not used to being around people and at a concert there are so many people then I took him to that bar afterwards. Was that too much for him? Or has he realized he should be afraid of me and wants to get away. I step forward, "Whats wrong? How come you're leaving so quickly?"  
我在想，昨晚对他来说是不是太过分了，他不习惯在人群中，而演唱会上人那么多，之后我还带他去了那家酒吧。这对他来说是不是太多了？还是他已经意识到应该害怕我，想要逃离。我向前一步，问道：“怎么了？为什么这么快就要走？”

"M-My alarm… it didn't… I have to go to work… I… I'm late and…"  
“我的闹钟…它没响…我得去上班…我…我迟到了…”

"Um Kaworu…" I step further into the room and shake my head, I guess he is a little bit confused.  
“嗯，薰…”我走进房间，摇了摇头，我想他有点困惑。

He doesn't reply as he finishes buttoning up his shirt. He looked around for what I presume is his tie or a jacket. He didn't have either object last night. He looks horrified, "Oh no… I-I haven't got them!"  
他没有回答，只是继续扣好衬衫的扣子。他环顾四周，我想他是在找领带或夹克。昨晚他并没有这两样东西。他看起来惊慌失措，“哦不……我、我没有带它们！”

"Kaworu…"I repeat myself as I walk further into the room. I lean my elbows casually on the back of the sofa and he once again ignores me as he picks up his wallet and phone and stuffs the items into his pockets.  
“渚薰……”我再次喊道，同时走进房间。我随意地将手肘靠在沙发背上，而他又一次无视了我，拿起钱包和手机，将它们塞进口袋。

"Kaworu!" I repeat a third time but this time raise my voice slightly, he stops dead in his tracks and turns to look at me.  
“渚薰！”我第三次喊道，这次稍微提高了声音，他突然停下脚步，转过身来看着我。

"A-Asuka I… I have to go, I… work…"  
"A-明日香，我…我得走了，我…要工作…"

"It's Saturday…" I say to him and I watch as the panic fades from his face only to be replaced once more by a look of embarrassment.  
"今天是星期六…" 我对他说，看着他脸上的恐慌逐渐消退，却又再次被尴尬的神情所取代。

"S-S-Saturday… Are you sure?"  
"星…星期六…你确定吗？"

I nod my head, "Well considering yesterday was Friday and Saturday is traditionally the day that comes after Friday I'm at least 99 percent sure."  
我点点头，“嗯，考虑到昨天是星期五，而星期六传统上是紧随其后的日子，我至少有 99%的把握。”

"Oh… I didn't… I forgot… the… being here and last night I…" He shakes his head and his cheeks are once again glowing a bright shade of red, "I… I am sorry. I did not wake you did I?"  
“哦……我没想到……我忘了……在这里和昨晚我……”他摇摇头，脸颊再次泛起鲜艳的红色，“我……我很抱歉。我没有吵醒你吧？”

I shake my head, "Don't worry about it, I was already awake. Sit down, I'll make you some coffee."  
我摇摇头，“别担心，我已经醒了。坐下吧，我给你弄点咖啡。”

He relaxes his shoulders and sits himself down on the sofa. I shoot him a grin as he awkwardly smiles back at me, "Thank you."  
他放松了肩膀，坐到沙发上。我朝他咧嘴一笑，他尴尬地回以微笑，"谢谢你。"

"How do you take it?" I ask.  
"你怎么喝？" 我问道。

"Some milk, and sugar." "加点牛奶和糖。"

I move into the kitchen area and start preparing some coffee for the two of us. I look over to him as he sits on my sofa looking around in an awkward fashion. Finally he speaks, "I… I must thank you once again for last night. The concert was simply wonderful and mesmerizing, humanity is… really capable of wondrous things."  
我走进厨房区，开始为我们俩准备咖啡。我瞥向他，他正坐在我的沙发上，尴尬地环顾四周。终于，他开口了，“我……我必须再次感谢你昨晚的款待。那场音乐会真是美妙绝伦，令人着迷，人类……确实能创造出奇迹般的事物。”

"I'm just glad you enjoyed it." I reply as I finish making our coffee. I bring them over to the sofa and place them down on the coffee table. I move a few things around on the table to try to make space. I try to avoid his gaze as I do so feeling somewhat embarrassed by the state of my front room. I can only imagine what Kaworu must think of this place considering the condition his own apartment is in.  
“我只是很高兴你喜欢。”我回答着，同时完成了咖啡的制作。我把它们端到沙发旁，放在咖啡桌上。我挪动了几样东西，试图腾出空间。我尽量避开他的目光，因为我的客厅状况让我感到有些尴尬。我只能想象，考虑到他自己的公寓状况，Kaworu 会怎么看待这个地方。

I try to keep the subject on the concert hoping that maybe he won't notice the used plate or empty cups I'm moving around, "I just figured it would be something you'd enjoy and I had the spare ticket."  
我试图将话题保持在音乐会上，希望他不会注意到我挪动的那些用过的盘子或空杯子，“我只是觉得你会喜欢，而且我有多余的票。”

"I enjoyed it very much, thank you for letting me use that spare ticket. I was not aware there were people performing the music in such a fashion."  
"我非常喜欢，谢谢你让我用那张多余的票。我之前不知道有人会以这种方式演奏音乐。"

"No problem. If I hear of anything else I'll let you know about it."  
"没事的。如果我听到其他什么消息，我会告诉你的。"

"That would be most kind of you. I… I still have a lot to learn about finding my way in this world it seems. Fuyutsuki has… helped me in some ways but I feel there is so much more that I cannot learn from him. He is… nice but he is quite a serious man. I do not feel I could ask him about things such as concerts, television or video games."  
"那真是太好了。我……我似乎还有很多关于在这个世界中找到方向的东西要学。冬月先生……在某些方面帮助了我，但我觉得还有很多东西是我无法从他那里学到的。他……人很好，但他是个相当严肃的人。我觉得我不能向他询问关于音乐会、电视或电子游戏之类的事情。"

I shrug, "Probably not. I… I try to have minimal contact with him to be honest. I'd rather not…"  
我耸耸肩，“大概不会。我……说实话，我尽量减少和他的接触。我宁愿不……”

I trail off before finally adding, "I just have my own stuff to worry about and his help isn't something I really need nor want."  
我话没说完，最后补充道，“我只是有自己的事情要操心，他的帮助既不是我真正需要的，也不是我想要的。”

Kaworu nods and picks up his cup cradling it in his hands for a few moments, "I see. I forgot to ask but what exactly is it that you do?"  
渚薰点点头，拿起杯子在手中捧了一会儿，“我明白了。我忘了问，但你具体是做什么的？”

I pause for a moment and wonder what I should say to him. I can't exactly turn around and say I do nothing at all. I don't want people to think I live off of the payout the UN gave me but I also like my anonymity. Very few people know the truth of what it is I do. I look back up at Kaworu, I can't imagine he'd tell anyone. It's not like he knows anyone aside from Fuyutsuki and I can already guarantee Fuyutsuki knows because of his network of security following me.  
我停顿了一下，思索着该对他说些什么。我总不能转身告诉他我无所事事。我不希望人们认为我靠联合国给我的补偿金生活，但我又喜欢保持匿名。很少有人知道我真正的工作是什么。我再次抬头看向薰，我无法想象他会告诉任何人。他除了冬月之外并不认识其他人，而我可以肯定冬月已经知道了，因为他的安全网络一直在跟踪我。

I get to my feet and go to one of the bookcases and pull one of the promotional copies of the first book from the shelf. I hand it to Kaworu, "I write."  
我站起身，走到一个书架前，从上面抽出一本第一本书的宣传样书。我递给薰，“我写作。”

"You write? That is wonderful! I had no idea!" His eyes grow wide with wonder as he takes the book from me. He studies the cover for a few moments because looking back up at me in confusion, "Mari… Makinami? But that… is not your name…"  
“你写作？太棒了！我完全不知道！”他接过书，眼中闪烁着惊奇的光芒。他仔细研究了一会儿封面，然后困惑地抬头看我，“真希波…玛金纳？但这…不是你的名字…”

"It's a pseudonym…" I reply flatly, "I don't use my real name."  
"这是个笔名……" 我平淡地回答，"我不使用真名。"

"Oh!" he looks at the book again before nodding, "I… I see… I understand."  
"哦！" 他再次看向书，然后点头，"我……我明白了……我懂了。"

I wonder for a brief moment if he really does understand but then he looks up at me and gives me a knowing smile and another nod. Of course he understands, he understands why I write under a pseudonym and why I don't want me name to be known. I don't need to tell Kaworu any of that because he'd be the same. We don't want people to recognize us because of the people we were or think we were.  
我短暂地怀疑他是否真的理解，但随后他抬头看向我，给了我一个会心的微笑和另一个点头。当然他理解，他理解我为何用笔名写作，为何不想让我的名字为人所知。我不需要向渚解释这些，因为他也会是同样的想法。我们不希望人们因为过去的我们或他们认为的我们而认出我们。

He turns the book over in his hand and starts to read the back of it. I now have to wonder if he'll make the connection, I can still remember quite clearly the look on her face when she did. I tried to hide those feelings of pride I felt when I saw it happen but I couldn't help it. I made Rei Ayanami cry tears of happiness, that was such an achievement and to make her happy like that is the least I could do to make up for what I put her and her brother through.  
他翻转手中的书，开始阅读背面。我现在不得不猜测他是否会联想到，我仍清晰记得她当时脸上的表情。我试图隐藏当我看到那一幕时感到的骄傲，但我无法抑制。我让绫波零流下了幸福的泪水，那是一项如此了不起的成就，让她那样快乐是我至少能做的，以弥补我给她和她哥哥带来的痛苦。

"Zero… A young girl brought up in isolation and unsure of her humanity. She is sent out to fight a great evil that threatens her race… Is this…"  
“零……一个在隔离中长大的年轻女孩，对自己的身份感到不确定。她被派去对抗威胁她种族的巨大邪恶……这是……”

I take the book from him and nod, "Yeah… It is… It's Rei."  
我从他手中接过书，点头道，“是的……就是她……是绫波。”

"D-Do you… have contact with her?" he averts his eyes as I silently nod my head.  
"你……和她有联系吗？" 他避开目光，我默默地点头。

"Yes I do, she was the one who told me who you were actually. She saw your name on that form and filled me in on the details."  
"是的，我有联系。是她告诉我你的真实身份的。她看到表格上有你的名字，就把详情告诉了我。"

Kaworu leaps to his feet, "Rei is here?"  
Kaworu 猛地站起身，"Rei 在这里吗？"

I hold out my hand to calm him, "Relax, she went back to Japan yesterday."  
我伸出手安抚他，“放松，她昨天回日本了。”

"Oh…"

He sits back down and relaxes somewhat. I wonder if I should tell him that it was Rei's ticket he used yesterday to go to the concert. I should probably tell him he has nothing to be afraid of when it comes to Rei but then I remember how she reacted to news that he was alive and wonder if that is true. Maybe he should be afraid of her.  
他坐回原位，稍微放松了一些。我在想是否应该告诉他，昨天他用的是丽的那张票去看演唱会。或许我该告诉他，在丽面前他无需害怕，但随即我想起她得知他还活着时的反应，又怀疑这话是否属实。也许他真的应该对丽有所提防。

"Rei is… actually one of the few friends I have… Probably the only friend actually. She is one of the few who knows who I am… where I am…" I let out a laugh, "Not that I made it easy for her of course."  
丽是……其实是我为数不多的朋友之一……大概也是唯一的朋友。她是少数几个知道我是谁……我在哪里的人……" 我笑出声来，"当然，我并没有让她轻易了解我。

I can still remember the moment Rei turned up on my doorstep as if it was yesterday. At that point in time I had only just started writing and I had settled on using Rei as a template for the main character. Why did I pick her at a template? Guilt I suppose, I felt a lot of guilt for everything I did back then and I still do feel it but Rei... she got the brunt of it. She was the verbal punching bag, I called her names and called her out in front of others.  
我至今仍记得丽出现在我家门口的那一刻，仿佛就在昨天。那时我才刚开始写作，决定以丽为原型塑造主角。为什么选择她作为模板？我想是出于愧疚吧，我对自己当时所做的一切感到非常内疚，至今仍有这种感觉，但丽……她承受了最多的痛苦。她是我的出气筒，我给她起绰号，在别人面前指责她。

I had no idea of course what she was and what she had been through. The worst thing is with how I was back then I don't think I'd have cared. I wanted to somehow make it up to her. Naturally I couldn't just pick up the phone and apologize, I had to make a grand gesture even if she didn't know about it. So I used her as a basis for the main character in my story.  
当然，我当时并不知道她的经历和她的真实身份。最糟糕的是，以我那时的状态，我想我也不会在乎。我想要以某种方式弥补她。自然，我不能只是打个电话道歉，我必须做出一个重大的举动，即使她并不知情。于是，我以她为原型创作了故事中的主角。

At the time I started this I had been living on my own for a year and a half. They had initially tried to put me back together with my father and his wife. For a moment I was tempted to go back. To try to have a normal family life and pretend nothing had happened but some of that old stubbornness and need for independence was still within me. I insisted that I be placed on my own and that I'd be more than capable of looking after myself.  
那时我开始这段生活时，已经独自生活了一年半。他们最初试图让我回到父亲和他的妻子身边。有那么一刻，我确实动摇了，想要尝试过正常的家庭生活，假装什么都没发生过。但内心深处那份固执和独立的需求依旧存在。我坚持要自己独立生活，并坚信自己完全有能力照顾好自己。

Besides I don't fit in with that group anymore, I never have done. I rebelled against the two of them from the moment my mother died through to leaving for Japan. I never gave them a chance to help me or be my family. I blamed my dad for my mother's death and whilst I got on with my stepmother I never really wanted her around. They have their own life, their own children now and whilst I do see them occasionally I try to keep my distance.  
况且，我再也融入不了那个圈子了，我从未真正融入过。从母亲去世到前往日本，我一直都在反抗他们俩。我从未给他们机会来帮助我或成为我的家人。我责怪父亲导致了母亲的离世，虽然与继母相处尚可，但我从未真正希望她在我身边。他们有自己的生活，现在也有了自己的孩子，尽管我偶尔会去看望他们，但总是尽量保持距离。

At that time my father and Fuyutsuki were still trying to maintain regular contact. When I heard the knock on my door I did think it'd be either of them. You can imagine both my surprise and horror when I saw that it was in fact Rei Ayanami. It turns out that she had been talking to Fuyutsuki about wanting to find me for some time. He had not told her where I was but she was smart. She knew that I'd have gone back to Germany and travelled there on her own.  
那时我父亲和冬月还在努力保持定期联系。听到敲门声时，我确实以为会是他们中的任何一个。你可以想象当我发现实际上是绫波零时，我的惊讶和恐惧。原来她已经和冬月谈过好一阵子，想找到我。冬月没有告诉她我在哪里，但她很聪明。她知道我会回到德国，于是独自一人去了那里。

From there she had found my parents and they had told her where I was. I wasn't angry at them, I understood why they did that. This person had just travelled thousands of miles to see me, they couldn't exactly turn them away.  
在那里，她找到了我的父母，他们告诉了她我的下落。我并不生他们的气，我理解他们为什么这么做。这个人刚刚跨越千里来见我，他们无法拒绝她。

My first thought was that Rei was here to yell at me or give me what it was I deserved for being such a horrible person to her and everyone else. Instead she looked at me across the doorstep for a few moments before saying my name and throwing herself at me. She bawled about how much it was she missed me. It was the first of many hugs I would receive from Rei.  
我首先想到的是，绫波来这里是为了对我大吼大叫，或者给我应得的惩罚，因为我对她和所有人都很糟糕。然而，她站在门口看了我一会儿，然后叫了我的名字，扑向我。她哭着说她有多么想念我。这是我从绫波那里得到的第一个拥抱。

She told me about how she had travelled all this way on her own under the guise of taking a holiday. She wanted as few people to know she was looking for me as possible. That suited me just fine, I wanted as few people to know where I was as possible. I made her promise to me that she wouldn't tell anyone she had been in contact with me. I told her why I left Japan and why I had to stay away, I don't know if she approved of my reasons or fully understood them but she has respected them and that is good enough for me. Both myself and Rei have been good friends ever since.  
她向我讲述了她是如何独自一人假借度假的名义来到这里的。她希望尽可能少的人知道她在找我。这正合我意，我也希望尽可能少的人知道我的行踪。我让她向我保证，不会告诉任何人她曾与我联系过。我告诉她我离开日本的原因以及为何必须远离，我不知道她是否赞同我的理由或完全理解，但她尊重我的选择，这对我来说已经足够了。从那以后，我和丽一直是好朋友。

Me and Kaworu sit drinking our coffee and another hour passes as we sit and talk about the concert last night and Kaworu tells me some of his experience in the emergence facility. Not long after that he excuses himself to go back home. We exchange phone numbers and e-mail addresses and make that promise to stay in contact with each other. I give him a copy of my book, signed of course, and he asks eagerly when the second one will be released.  
我和渚薰坐着喝咖啡，又过了一个小时，我们聊起了昨晚的音乐会，渚薰还向我讲述了一些他在出现设施的经历。不久后，他告辞回家。我们交换了电话号码和电子邮件地址，并承诺保持联系。我给了他一本我的书，当然签了名，他还急切地询问第二本何时出版。

As I watch him leave I take my phone out of the pocket and see I've received a message from Rei. It's an apology that she didn't get in touch sooner but she is now back in Japan and is alright. She tells me that she ended up going out with Misato and her brother for dinner and she was too tired to do anything when she returned. She warns me to be careful and reminds me once again about how dangerous Kaworu is.  
看着他离去，我从口袋里掏出手机，发现收到了丽的一条消息。她为没有及时联系而道歉，但现在她已经回到日本，一切安好。她告诉我，她和美里还有她哥哥一起吃了晚饭，回来时太累了，什么也做不了。她提醒我要小心，并再次强调了渚的危险性。

I read that last sentence over again and feel a pang in my stomach. Kaworu slips out of view and I stand in my doorway for a few moments thinking over the strange situation. That person that Rei thinks Kaworu is... is not the person I met last night and went out to a concert with. Kaworu is just like me... He's just like all of us, he's afraid and trying to figure things out. I understand Rei's concerns and worries and I wonder just how I'm going to explain to her that I didn't just not follow her advice but I spent the night at a concert with him and let him crash on my sofa.  
我又读了一遍最后那句话，心里一阵刺痛。渚的身影消失在视线中，我在门口站了一会儿，思索着这奇怪的情况。丽认为的渚的那个人……并不是我昨晚遇见并一起去音乐会的那个人。渚和我一样……他和我们所有人一样，他害怕，也在努力弄清楚一切。我理解丽的担忧和忧虑，我好奇自己该如何向她解释，我没有听从她的建议，反而和他一起去了音乐会，还让他睡在了我的沙发上。

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**

**Tokyo 2 – Afternoon 东京 2 号——午后**

I feel exhausted as I navigate the shopping bags set down around me in an attempt to place my tray on the table. I slide the chair out and sit down, grateful for the opportunity to take the weight off of my feet. Around me others are doing the same, Touji and Hikari taking up a position opposite me, Kensuke takes the seat to my left and Rei the one to my right.  
我感到筋疲力尽，试图在周围堆满购物袋的桌子上放下我的托盘。我拉出椅子坐下，感激有机会让双脚休息一下。周围其他人也在做同样的事情，东治和光坐在我对面，真希则坐在我的左边，丽坐在我的右边。

Myself, Hikari and Kensuke all seem to have gotten the same thing. Rei has opted for a salad, one of the few vegetarian options in this fast food place. Touji, as expected has gone for one of the 'deluxe' burger options and as I glance as his tray I wonder how a human is even supposed to fit that in their mouth. Yet I know that somehow Touji will manage it.  
我和光、真希似乎都点了同样的东西。丽选择了沙拉，这是这家快餐店为数不多的素食选项之一。东治，不出所料，点了一个“豪华”汉堡，当我瞥向他的托盘时，我好奇人类怎么可能把那东西塞进嘴里。然而我知道，东治总有办法搞定。

Rei, sensing my exhaustion turns to me and smiles warmly, "Are you feeling okay Shinji?"  
丽察觉到我的疲惫，转向我，温暖地微笑着，“你还好吗，真嗣？”

I give her a nod and smile back, "I'm alright Rei, just tired. We've covered a lot of ground today."  
我向她点头微笑，“我没事，丽，只是有点累。今天我们走了不少路。”

I look at the amount of shopping bags we all have between us and that seems to be a bit of an understatement. It's been a long time since we've all been out together like this. It means we all had a bit of extra money to spend too.  
我看着我们所有人手中的购物袋，这似乎有点轻描淡写了。我们很久没有像这样一起出来了。这意味着我们都有点额外的钱可以花。

"Good, I would not wish for you to be uncomfortable."  
“很好，我不希望你感到不适。”

My smile grows wider, "I know Rei, don't worry about me though. I'm... I'm fine when I'm with all of you."  
我的笑容更灿烂了，“我知道丽，不过别担心我。我……和你们在一起时，我感觉很好。”

There is a brief moment of silence as people get comfortable and begin to eat their food. Touji greedily picks up his burger. It's huge and I dread to think what is inside it. He takes a bit from it and makes a satisfied noise after doing so. Hikari shoots him a disapproving look as she politely bites into her food.  
大家安静了一会儿，各自调整好姿势开始用餐。冬二贪婪地拿起他的汉堡。那汉堡巨大无比，我都不敢想里面塞了些什么。他咬了一口，满意地哼了一声。光子瞪了他一眼，自己则优雅地小口吃着食物。

Contrary to Rei's concernts I have had a good day. I always do when I'm with them all. It's one of the few times I never feel afraid. I never have to worry about anything when I'm around them. I can just be myself and enjoy it all. They're all my friends and being with them somehow manages to alleviate all my fears and concerns.  
与丽所担忧的相反，我今天过得很愉快。和他们在一起时我总是如此。这是我难得不感到害怕的时刻之一。在他们身边，我无需担心任何事。我可以做回自己，尽情享受这一切。他们都是我的朋友，和他们在一起似乎能驱散我所有的恐惧和忧虑。

Yet as I look at the empty sixth seat at our table I am hit with something of a bittersweet feeling. I feel like I shouldn't be bothered by it now, it's been years but she was a part of this group and in a way, she still is. I feel like she should be here shopping and laughing with us. Calling us idiots and marching us from place to place.  
然而，当我看着我们桌子上空着的第六个座位时，一种苦乐参半的感觉涌上心头。我觉得现在不应该为此烦恼，已经过去多年了，但她曾是这个团队的一部分，某种程度上，她依然是的。我感觉她应该在这里和我们一起购物、欢笑，称呼我们为傻瓜，带着我们从一个地方走到另一个地方。

I shake my head and try to focus on my food. I do still wonder about her from time to time. It was upsetting when she left and I naturally blamed myself, I still do blame myself. I miss her a lot but at the same time I think I understood why she left. I know she wasn't happy here in Japan and I just hope wherever she is now that she is happy. She deserves that.  
我摇摇头，试图专注于我的食物。我偶尔还是会想起她。她离开时我很伤心，自然地责怪自己，至今仍自责。我很想念她，但同时我也理解她离开的原因。我知道她在这里不快乐，我只希望无论她现在身在何处，她都能快乐。她值得拥有那份幸福。

"How was America Rei?" I hear Hikari ask.  
“美国怎么样，丽？”我听到光问。

"America was good, I was unfortunately unable to view everything I wished to whilst I was there so I will have to visit again in the future." Rei tells her, "I was however quite fortunate to be able to witness a live dinosaur bone excavation."  
"美国很不错，可惜我在那里时没能看到所有我想看的，所以将来还得再去一次。" 丽告诉她，"不过我很幸运能亲眼目睹一次活生生的恐龙化石挖掘。"

"A dinosaur excavation! That must have been amazing!" Kensuke exclaims loudly, "What sort was it? Was it a T-Rex? Was it something huge with big teeth?"  
"恐龙挖掘！那一定很惊人！" 健介大声惊叹，"是什么种类的？是霸王龙吗？还是那种有着大牙齿的巨型恐龙？"

"It was a Triceratops." Rei replies cooly.  
"是三角龙。" 丽冷静地回答道。"

"You know…" Touji speaks with his mouth half full of his food, an action that earns him a stern glare from Hikari, "I find it hard to believe that creatures like that roamed around once. I mean can you imagine something that big just walking around?"  
"你知道吗…" 真嗣嘴里塞满了食物说道，这一举动让他赢得了光严厉的一瞥，"我很难相信那种生物曾经在周围游荡。我是说，你能想象那么大的东西就在周围走动吗？"

One by one each of us raise our head and stare at Touji in mild disbelief. He sees us all staring and shrugs, "What?"  
我们一个接一个地抬起头，带着些许难以置信的目光盯着真嗣。他看到我们都在盯着他，耸了耸肩，"怎么了？"

Hikari shakes her head, "You can be so dense sometimes Touji!"  
光摇了摇头，"你有时候真是迟钝得可以，真嗣！"

"What… What did I say?" Touji asks.  
"我…我说了什么？" 东治问道。

"The Angels Touji…" "使徒，东治…"

"Oh!" He finally realizes, "Yeah but they were different like… the dinosaurs were really big right?"  
"哦！" 他终于明白了，"对，但它们不一样，就像…恐龙真的很大，对吧？"

"The dinosaurs weren't bigger than the Angels of the Eva's Touji!" Kensuke informs him, "The Eva's must have been like a hundred metres tall! No Dinosaur was that big…"  
"恐龙可没有 EVA 的东治天使那么大！" 健介告诉他，"EVA 肯定有一百米高！没有哪种恐龙有那么大……"

Kensuke trails off when he sees the glare that Hikari is now shooting him. He turns around to me and Rei and shrugs, "Sorry guys… I guess… not really a suitable subject is it?"  
健介看到光希现在瞪他的眼神，声音渐渐小了下去。他转向我和丽，耸了耸肩，"抱歉，伙计们……我猜……这话题不太合适，是吧？"

"I don't mind but… Rei?"  
"我不介意，不过……丽？"

I look towards me sister, "Aida is quite correct, the Eva's were much taller than any known dinosaur. The Angels however did vary in size, some of the dinosaurs may in fact have been larger than them in fact I can think of at least two."  
"我转向我的妹妹，“Aida 说得没错，Eva 们比任何已知的恐龙都要高大。不过使徒的体型确实各异，有些恐龙实际上可能比它们还要大，至少我能想到两种。””

"Well what about Godzilla! That was a dinosaur right and that was pretty big."  
““那哥斯拉呢！那也是恐龙吧，而且相当巨大。””

Hikari groans as Kensuke gestures wildly in his reply, "Godzilla was fictional Touji! Besides Godzilla varied in size depending on the film. Film companies could never keep it consistent, sometimes it was 50 metres and in the new one it was 150 metres!"  
"光子叹了口气，看着真希挥舞着手臂反驳道，“哥斯拉是虚构的，阿斯兰！而且哥斯拉的体型因电影而异。制片公司从未能保持一致，有时它有 50 米高，而在新片中则达到了 150 米！””

"So it could have been the same size as an Eva!" Touji replies, "So could it have taken on an Eva? Imagine that, Godzilla vs an Evangelion!"  
"这么说，它可能和 Eva 一样大！" 冬二回答，"那它能不能变成 Eva 的样子呢？想象一下，哥斯拉对战福音战士！"

"An Eva would crush Godzilla Touji! I mean did you see the Eva's?"  
"Eva 会把哥斯拉碾压的，冬二！我是说，你看过 Eva 吗？"

"Guys!" Hikari tries to interject.  
"伙计们！" 光试图插话。

I laugh it off, "I don't mind, besides can't really stop them can we?"  
我笑着摆手，“我不介意，再说也阻止不了他们，不是吗？”

It's such an absurd conversation I can't help but laugh at it. Besides I don't mind them talking about the Eva as much anymore, I still associate a lot of painful memories with it but I can't hide from it. On the other hand I do wonder if I should stop it, Rei looks quite angry as she glares between the two of them.  
这场对话太荒谬了，我不禁笑出声来。虽然现在我对他们谈论 Eva 不再那么介意，但与之相关的许多痛苦记忆依旧萦绕心头，我无法逃避。另一方面，我也好奇是否该制止他们，丽看着他们，眼神中明显带着怒意。

"Yeah but Godzilla has near impenetrable armour AND is has the nuclear breath! I bet it could do some damage to the Eva's."  
“是啊，但哥斯拉有近乎坚不可摧的装甲，还有核能吐息！我敢打赌它能对 Eva 造成不小的伤害。”

"Suzahara, stop this!" Rei speaks quietly but firmly. I should have asked them to stop, clearly Rei is uncomfortable with what is happening. I start to hand my head but then she speaks again and my jaw nearly drops, "You are mistaken, such a creature would not pose any sort of challenge for any one of the Eva's. It lacks the A.T. Field and the array of weaponry that each of us possessed, therefore we would eventually prevail."  
“铃原，停下来！”丽平静但坚定地说道。我本该让他们停止的，显然丽对正在发生的事情感到不适。我正要低头，但她又开口了，我差点惊掉了下巴：“你误会了，这样的生物对任何一位 EVA 驾驶员来说都不构成挑战。它没有 A.T.力场和我们的武器装备，因此我们最终会取胜。”

**3rd September 2021 2021 年 9 月 3 日**

**Asuka's Apartment – Afternoon  
明日香的家——下午**

Two weeks have now passed since I saw Kaworu Nagisa. We've kept in contact with one another since then, a few messages here and there but we haven't seen one another in person. I guess I feel… nervous about him and our friendship. After he left on that day my thoughts were occupied by him and him alone. It gave me a warm feeling but also one I'm afraid of.  
自从我见到渚薰已经过去两周了。自那以后我们一直保持着联系，偶尔发几条消息，但还没有面对面见过。我想我对他和我们的友谊感到……紧张。那天他离开后，我的思绪全被他占据，这让我感到温暖，但也让我害怕。

It was nice to sit alongside him at that concert, to know he was smiling because of me and for us to cheer as we watched that band play some of our favourite music. I even think about how cute he looked on that Saturday morning. It was nice to just, for a short period of time, not be plagued by the constant guilt and worry that I always feel.  
在音乐会上与他并肩而坐很愉快，知道他因为我而微笑，我们一起为乐队演奏我们最喜欢的音乐而欢呼。我甚至还记得那个周六早上他看起来多么可爱。那段时间，我暂时摆脱了总是困扰我的内疚和担忧，感觉真好。

It was just for that one day though, the very next day the nightmares returned and along with it all the doubt and worry. That realization returned that I was a bad person and I don't deserve to be happy. It was such a crash from the highs I felt the previous day. I even managed to feel disgusted with myself for enjoying the sight of his mostly naked body.  
但那只是一天而已，第二天噩梦就回来了，随之而来的还有所有的怀疑和担忧。我意识到自己是个坏人，不配拥有幸福。从前一天的高涨情绪中跌落的感觉太糟糕了。我甚至因为享受他近乎赤裸的身体而感到自我厌恶。

I, Asuka Langley Soryu, do not deserve to be happy nor do I deserve to have anyone nearby who makes or tries to make me happy. I know exactly what will happen because I know who I really am. I know what I'll do if they get close, I'll just end up hurting them. Like I've hurt so many others in my life. I was tempted to do it to Kaworu, to angrily message him and tell him to never come near me again.  
我，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，不配拥有幸福，也不配身边有任何人试图让我快乐。我清楚会发生什么，因为我了解真正的自己。我知道如果他们靠近，我只会伤害他们。就像我一生中伤害过那么多人一样。我曾想对渚薰那样做，愤怒地给他发消息，告诉他永远不要靠近我。

I didn't do that though, I couldn't do that because I want to see him again, I need to see him again. A stronger part of me is pushing to keep up this friendship because maybe, just maybe I do deserve to be happy.  
但我没有那么做，我做不到，因为我想要再见他，我需要再见他。我内心更强大的一部分在推动我维持这段友谊，因为也许，只是也许，我确实值得幸福。

Of course adding to my guilt is the fact that I couldn't bring myself to tell Rei about my encounter with Kaworu. She should know, she is and has been my only friend over the last couple of years but I don't know what I should say to her. What can I say? I heard what she said about Kaworu, about how dangerous he is. I can't exactly turn around and tell her I went to visit him, took him to a concert and let him sleep on my couch.  
当然，让我更加内疚的是，我无法鼓起勇气告诉绫波关于我和渚薰的相遇。她应该知道，她是我过去几年里唯一的朋友，但我不知道该对她说什么。我能说什么呢？我听到了她对渚薰的评价，关于他有多危险。我总不能转身告诉她，我去找了他，带他去听了音乐会，还让他睡在我的沙发上。

The only saving grace is that I've been kept quite busy these past two weeks so not had as much time to become absorbed in my guilt. My publisher decided to send out the press releases and set a date for my second books release, without consulting me first. Fourth of December it'll come out, my Birthday. It's not really a date I enjoy being reminded of, nothing good has ever happened on my Birthday.  
唯一值得庆幸的是，过去两周我忙得不可开交，所以没有太多时间沉浸在自责中。我的出版商未经我同意就决定发布新闻稿，并定下了我的第二本书的发行日期。12 月 4 日，那一天也是我的生日。这个日期我并不喜欢被提醒，因为我的生日从未发生过什么好事。

I push that thought aside, last year was pretty good. I got a nice e-mail from Rei and she sent me a package with a cuddly toy rabbit. I bought myself a cake, it was nice.  
我抛开这个念头，去年其实还不错。我收到了丽发来的温馨邮件，她还寄给我一个毛绒玩具兔子。我自己买了一个蛋糕，感觉很好。

The publisher's decision meant I've had to do a bit of extra work on the book as I want it to be ready in plenty of time. I finished up the ending and went through the entire thing altering and correcting the sections I wasn't happy with. It didn't take me too long to do, if I've retained anything good from my past-self it's that I tend to be quite good at what I set my mind to and I make minimal mistakes. So when it comes to the release of Mari Makinami's second book, things should go smoothly.  
出版商的决定意味着我需要为这本书多做一些工作，以确保它有充足的时间准备就绪。我完成了结尾部分，并通读全文，修改和校正了我不满意的部分。这并没有花我太多时间，如果我从过去的自己那里保留了什么优点，那就是我通常对自己设定的目标相当擅长，并且犯的错误极少。因此，当真希波·真理奈的第二本书发行时，一切应该会顺利进行。

I now find myself bored and wondering what I should do tonight. I've been irritating myself throughout the day with the idea of messaging Kaworu and asking if he would like to do something. Yet I know I should probably stay far away from him. Sending texts or e-mailing is fine, there is no contact or risk there but seeing each other in person. I just know if we continue to be friends he'll eventually realize who I am and leave.  
我现在感到无聊，不知道今晚该做些什么。一整天，我都在纠结是否该给渚发消息，问他是否想做点什么。然而我知道，我或许应该离他远些。发短信或邮件倒无妨，没有接触也没有风险，但面对面相见就不同了。我心里清楚，如果我们继续做朋友，他迟早会认出我是谁，然后离开。

Yet I really want to see him again. I'm at a loss on what to do and even what to say. I have my phone in my hands, our conversation open and ready for me to type something. It's not like I've invited anyone out before. The concert was a spur of the moment thing because I felt bad for him. If I ask him out again then how will that look? What will he say? Will it be a... one of those d-words?  
但我真的很想再见他一面。我不知道该怎么做，甚至该说什么。手机就在我手中，对话框已经打开，等待我输入些什么。我以前从未邀请过任何人出去。那次音乐会是因为我觉得他可怜，一时冲动之举。如果我再次约他出去，那会是什么样子？他会说什么？会不会是那种...那种带有'约会'意味的事情？

I've been on a grand total of one of those in my life. I ended up leaving the guy in the queue for a rollercoaster because he bored me. After that I went home and made one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I have very little faith in myself as to how things would go on another date.  
我这辈子总共就经历过一次那种事。结果在排队等过山车时，我因为觉得那人无聊而离开了。之后我回家，犯下了我人生中最大的错误之一。对于再次约会的结果，我对自己几乎没有什么信心。

Still, I'm certain he would be interested. We have have been messaging each other a lot. He even asked me for advice on buying a games console. I was happy to advise him on which one to get and a number of games.  
尽管如此，我确信他会感兴趣。我们一直频繁地互发消息。他甚至还向我咨询购买游戏机的建议。我很乐意指导他选择哪款游戏机以及推荐一些游戏。

He's been informing me of his progress since then. It's been quite funny, even cute to see him go from not understanding anything to learning the games and enjoying them. He's been sending me screenshots of progress in levels or whenever he's won a match on a football game. Maybe that's what I could do, invite him over to play games together.  
自那以后，他一直在向我汇报他的进展。看到他从一无所知到逐渐学会并享受游戏的过程，既有趣又可爱。他经常发给我他在游戏关卡中的进度截图，或者在足球游戏中赢得比赛时的截图。也许我可以邀请他来一起玩游戏。

I let out a sigh and go back to the home screen of my phone. Why is this so difficult? I'm Asuka Langley Soryu damnit, I'm not supposed to have difficulty doing things. I'm a published author, I was an accomplished pilot and I got a damn college degree before I was fourteen. I shouldn't be having difficulty contacting someone because I want to hand out with them.  
我叹了口气，回到手机的主屏幕。为什么这件事这么难？我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，天哪，我不应该有做不成的事。我是个出版过作品的作家，曾是一名出色的飞行员，还在十四岁之前就拿到了大学学位。我不应该因为想和某人出去玩就难以联系他们。

I know why it's difficult though. It's difficult because I'm Asuka Langley Soryu. The petulant bratty girl who exists only to hurt others. Who should stay away from other people lest they see through me.  
我知道为什么这很难。难是因为我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。那个只会伤害别人的任性女孩。应该远离他人，以免他们看穿我。

I'm midway through my mental assault on myself when I suddenly see my phone start to ring. My heart leaps into my mouth thinking it could be him but I feel only disappointment when I don't recognize the caller ID. I'm prepared to ignore it but realize with the book stuff it might be important. On answering I'm greeted by a voice I haven't heard in years.  
我正自我攻击到一半时，突然看到手机开始响了。我心跳加速，以为可能是他，但看到不认识的来电显示时只有失望。我准备忽略它，但想到书的事情可能很重要。接通后，我听到了一个多年未闻的声音。

"Hello, is that Asuka?" “你好，是明日香吗？”

I almost hang up on him, the only reason I don't is because I can detect the hint of panic in his voice. Knowing his relationship with Kaworu he's earned at least a minute of my time.  
我差点挂了他的电话，没这么做的原因是我听出了他声音中的一丝慌乱。考虑到他和渚的关系，他至少赢得了我一分钟的时间。

"It is." I reply sharply, "Can I ask why you're calling, I thought I said I-"  
“是的。”我尖锐地回答，“我能问一下你为什么打电话来吗，我记得我说过我——”

"Yes, I know and normally I would not have contacted you but you are the only person I could contact, it's Nagisa he-"  
“是的，我知道，通常我不会联系你，但你是唯一我能联系的人，是渚他——”

My heart leaps into my mouth again although unlike last time it doesn't feel quite as good, "Kaworu? What happened?"  
我的心再次提到了嗓子眼，尽管与上次不同，这次并没有那么愉快，“渚薰？发生了什么？”

"There has been an incident. I know you and he have been in contact and I didn't know who else to contact. Do you think you could come over?"  
“发生了一件事。我知道你和他有联系，我不知道还能联系谁。你觉得你能过来吗？”

I don't hesitate in my reply, instead I leap up off of my sofa and hastily put my jacket on, "I'll be right there."-  
我毫不犹豫地回答，随即从沙发上跳起来，匆忙穿上外套，“我马上就到。”

**Kaworu's Apartment. 渚薰的公寓。**

My heart is beating rapidly in my chest as I turn the corner onto the street where Kaworu's apartment block is. I get to his building and lean against the wall for a moment to try to catch my breath. I regret having ran so much but I couldn't delay in getting here. I had to find out what had happened to Kaworu.  
我的心在胸腔里狂跳，当我拐过街角，来到渚薰公寓楼所在的那条街时。我到了他的楼前，靠在墙上喘口气。我后悔跑得太急，但我不能耽搁来这里的时间。我必须弄清楚渚薰发生了什么事。

I push the door to the lobby open and move through the corridor towards Kaworu's door. I knock a few times and barely any time passes between me knocking and the door opening. I ignore Fuyutsuki's greeting as I push past him and move into the front room. The curtains have been closed letting in only a small amount of light, a lamp is on next to the TV and I look around for him.  
我推开大厅的门，穿过走廊走向渚薰的房门。我敲了几下，几乎在我敲门的同时，门就开了。我无视了冬月老师的问候，推开他走进前厅。窗帘紧闭，只透进一丝光线，电视旁的一盏灯亮着，我四处寻找他。

Finally, I see him, lying on the sofa his eyes wide open in terror. He looks just as bad, if not worse than he did when I first met him. Only this time I can see the reason why. I try to not gasp at the sight of him. He's hurt and I don't even mean a little bit. Even at this distance I can make out the bruising around his eye, I can see his lip has been cut and there are little smudges of blood under his nose and on his cheeks.  
终于，我看到了他，躺在沙发上，眼睛因恐惧而睁得大大的。他的样子和初见时一样糟糕，甚至更甚。只是这次我能看出原因。我尽量不因他的样子而惊呼。他受了伤，远不止一点。即使隔着这段距离，我也能看到他眼周的淤青，他的嘴唇被割破，鼻下和脸颊上还有血迹。

I step further into the room and see that his shirt has been ripped and bloodied as well. The poor guy is an absolute mess. I quickly make my way over to his side and kneel down next him. I take his trembling hands in my own. As I look back up, I see Fuyutsuki has entered the room now.  
我进一步走进房间，发现他的衬衫也被撕破并沾满了血。这个可怜的家伙简直一团糟。我迅速走到他身边，跪在他旁边。我握住他颤抖的双手。当我再次抬头时，看到冬月已经进入了房间。

"What the hell happened to him?" My voice is shaking as I speak. I try to keep it steady, I try to keep myself from yelling. I can feel rage building inside of me but I need to keep it in check. Kaworu is terrified enough without seeing me explode.  
“他到底发生了什么？”我说话时声音在颤抖。我努力保持平稳，努力控制自己不要大喊。我能感觉到愤怒在内心积聚，但我需要克制住。看到我爆发只会让渚更加恐惧。

Fuyutsuki stands near to the sofa and merely shakes his head, "He was attacked."  
冬月站在沙发旁，只是摇了摇头，“他遭到了袭击。”

"Yes, I can see that." I snarl at him, "Who by? When? How?" I though the UN goons were watching us all the time, how did they let something like this happen?"  
“是的，我看得出来。”我朝他咆哮，“谁干的？什么时候？怎么发生的？”我以为联合国的人一直在监视我们，他们怎么会让这种事发生？”

Fuyutsuki says nothing for a few moments and merely bows his head. I can see the sorrow in his eyes but a part of me doesn't care. I'm not going to feel sorry for that damn old man, not when Kaworu is lying here shaking and hurt. I ask him again, "His security, what the hell were they doing?"  
冬月沉默了几秒，只是低下了头。我能从他的眼中看到悲伤，但一部分的我并不在乎。我不会为那个该死的老头感到难过，尤其是当渚薰躺在这里颤抖和受伤的时候。我再次质问他，“他的安保，他们到底在干什么？”

Again, I get no reply and it slowly starts to dawn on me what has happened. I open my mouth in shock as I look forwards Kaworu and once again at Fuyutsuki. I don't even need to be told but I ask anyway just for confirmation.  
又一次，我没有得到回复，慢慢地我开始明白发生了什么。我震惊地张开嘴，先看向渚薰，然后又看向冬月。我甚至不需要被告知，但我还是问了，只是为了确认。

"It was them... Wasn't it?"  
“是他们……对吧？”

Fuyutsuki nods, "Our security are checked and vetter, this shouldn't have happened."  
冬月点头，“我们的安保已经检查和审查过了，这本不该发生。”

"Well it did!" I snap back, "Where the hell are they?"  
"确实如此！" 我反驳道，"他们到底在哪儿？"

"Both of them have been relieved of their jobs and are with the appropriate authorities. I will be making sure they are dealt with as strongly as possible."  
"他们俩都已被解除职务，并交由相关部门处理。我会确保他们受到尽可能严厉的惩罚。"

"Not good enough." I get to my feet, "Where are they, I'll deal with them."  
"这还不够。" 我站起身，"他们在哪儿，我自己去处理。"

I start to move forward but I'm stopped when I feel Kaworu tugging at my hand. Fuyutsuki looks at me, "Miss Soryu, please..."  
我开始向前移动，但当我感觉到渚在拉我的手时停了下来。冬月看着我，“绫波小姐，请……”

"Those goons are supposed to be protecting us! They're supposed to be protecting him! You are supposed to be protecting him! You promised him that much! What sort of pathetic excuse for protection is this is they're the ones hurting him!"  
“那些家伙应该是保护我们的！他们应该是保护他的！你应该是保护他的！你答应过他这一点！这种保护算什么可悲的借口？他们反而在伤害他！”

I try to move forward again and break myself free of Kaworu's grip. I wonder if Fuyutsuki will try to stop me. I don't care, if I have to deal with him then I will but I won't let those bastards get away with this. I don't care what Kaworu is or what he was, he didn't deserve this to happen to him.  
我再次试图向前移动，挣脱渚的握持。我想知道冬月是否会试图阻止我。我不在乎，如果我必须面对他，那么我会这么做，但我不会让那些混蛋就这样逃脱。我不在乎渚是什么人或者他曾经是什么，他不应该遭受这样的对待。

"Soryu please." "Soryu，请。"

I stop still again and fix the former professor with an ice-cold stare, "What exactly is the purpose of the people who watch and follow us Fuyutsuki?"  
我再次停下脚步，用冰冷的目光盯着前教授，“那些观察并跟随我们的人，究竟有何目的，Fuyutsuki？”

He bows his head again, "I know..."  
他再次低下头，“我知道……”

"Their purpose is to make sure that people like me and Kaworu don't come to any harm. I didn't ask for their protection but I know they're there. I know he was promised it though, I know he was assured it and they have failed... You have failed! You-"  
"他们的职责是确保像我和渚这样的人不会受到伤害。我并没有要求他们的保护，但我知道他们就在那里。我知道他曾被承诺过保护，我知道他被保证过，但他们失败了……你们失败了！你——"

"A-Asuka... please..." "明日香... 请..."

I'm stopped mid rant by Kaworu's weakened voice. It pulls me out of my anger back to reality and I turn to see he is sitting up now.  
渚微弱的声音打断了我激烈的斥责。它将我从愤怒中拉回现实，我转身看到他现在正坐起身来。

"Please... I... I do not wish for you to fight nor for anyone else to be hurt. What happened to me... I... I deserve thi-"  
"请...我...我不希望你战斗，也不希望任何人受伤。发生在我身上的事...我...我应得的..."

"Shut up!" I snap back at him, "Don't you dare! Don't you dare tell me or dare to think that you deserve this. No one deserves this."  
"闭嘴！"我厉声回敬他，"你敢！你敢告诉我或敢想你应得这个。没有人应得这个。"

I shake my head one more time and slowly move back to Kaworu's side. I sit myself near to him and bring him down to rest his head on my lap. I gently run a hand through his hair and try to calm myself down. I can't let my anger get the better of me, if I storm out then what does Kaworu have? When I can though, if I can, then I'm going to make those bastards pay.  
我再次摇了摇头，慢慢退回到渚薰身边。我坐到他旁边，让他把头靠在我的膝上。我温柔地用手梳理他的头发，试图让自己平静下来。我不能让愤怒控制我，如果我冲出去，渚薰还有什么？只要有机会，如果我能做到，我会让那些混蛋付出代价。

"What happened Kaworu?" I try to soften my voice and he looks back up at me, his eyes wounded and tearful.  
"怎么了，卡沃鲁？" 我尽量让声音柔和些，他抬起头看向我，眼中带着伤痛和泪光。

"I was coming back from work... They approached me and they... attacked me in the lobby of my block. I... I couldn't fight back... They..."  
"我下班回来... 他们靠近我，就在我住的那栋楼的门厅里... 他们... 袭击了我。我... 我无力还手... 他们..."

I hush him, I don't need to hear anymore. It's not like many people would have been able to put up much of a fight against two trained members of whatever the group is that is trailing us. Even if he had it probably would have ended up being worse for him.  
我安抚他，不需要再听更多了。面对那些追踪我们的组织的训练有素的成员，没多少人能抵抗多久。即使他能反击，恐怕结果对他会更糟。

"They've been identified?" I ask Fuyutsuki.  
"他们已经被确认身份了？" 我问冬月。

He nods, "Yes, they're with the authorities now and have been relieved of their job. You have my word that they will be punished for this."  
他点头，"是的，他们现在被当局控制，并已被解除职务。我向你保证，他们将为此受到惩罚。"

"And what exactly does that mean Fuyutsuki?" I snap back, "Your word? Why should I..."  
"那究竟意味着什么，冬月？" 我反驳道，"你的保证？我为什么要..."

"A-Asuka... please he... he wants to help, this isn't his fault."  
"A-明日香...请...他...他是想帮忙，这不是他的错。"

I stare a hole through Fuyutsuki. From here I can see he looks ashamed and maybe even a little bit angry himself. Good.  
我盯着冬月，仿佛要将他看穿。从这里我能看出他显得羞愧，甚至可能还有点儿生气。很好。

"I know you don't have a high opinion of me Soryu and I don't blame you. You have every right to hate me but I promise you I will deal with this."  
"我知道你对我评价不高，惣流，我不怪你。你有充分的理由恨我，但我向你保证，我会处理好这件事。"

I look back towards Kaworu, fine, I'll try it their way.  
我回头看向渚薰，好吧，我就试试他们的方式。

"Alright, I won't do anything but you promise me... you promise both me and him... You make a promise Fuyutsuki that you will deal with the two bastards that did this."  
“好吧，我不会做任何事，但你要向我保证……向我和他都保证……你得承诺，福音津，你会处理那两个混蛋。”

"I promise you that Soryu, you too Nagisa. I will deal with this." He bows his head towards us, "I will take my leave now. It seems I am in for a busy night. You will both be alright?"  
“我向你保证，惣流，还有你，渚。我会处理这件事。”他向我们低头，“我现在得走了。看来今晚会很忙。你们俩会没事的吧？”

"Yes. I'll take care of him." I reply coldly.  
“是的，我会照顾他。”我冷冷地回答。

He says his goodbye and leaves the room. I hear the front door close and I let out a sigh before looking once more at Kaworu. I hear him let out a sniff and a tear rolls down his cheek. I squeeze his hand and continue to run my other hand through his hair. I guess I got what I wanted, to see him again only not exactly as I'd have wished it.  
他说完再见，离开了房间。我听到前门关闭的声音，叹了口气，再次看向渚薰。我听到他吸了吸鼻子，一滴泪珠滑过他的脸颊。我握紧他的手，继续用另一只手抚摸他的头发。我想我得到了我想要的，再次见到他，只是并非如我所愿。

"I'm here Kaworu, I'm here as long as you need me to be. You're safe now, I promise."  
“我在这里，渚薰，只要你需要，我会一直在这里。你现在安全了，我保证。”

### Chapter 5: You're Not Alone  
第五章：你并不孤单  

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**

**Tokyo 2 – Late afternoon  
东京 2 – 傍晚时分**

"Shinji, I need to speak with you."  
“真嗣，我有话要跟你说。”

I put down the piece of sheet music I'm looking over and look towards Rei as she enters the living room. There is something about her seems, off and I feel a sense of worry as I watch her enter the room. Rei looks worried, immediately I stand up, "Of course, Rei! Is everything alright?"  
我放下正在审阅的乐谱，目光转向丽走进客厅。她似乎有些不对劲，我看着她进屋，心中涌起一丝担忧。丽看起来很焦虑，我立刻站起来，“当然，丽！一切都好吗？”

She makes her way towards me and nods, "It is... fine but I fear I have made a mistake."  
她朝我走来，点了点头，“没事……但我担心自己犯了个错误。”

That slightly worried feeling I had moments before begins to morph into that familiar sense of butterflies in my stomach. It's not like Rei to look nervous or worried like this. Scenarios begin to rush through my head as to what could be wrong. I wonder if someone has hurt her or threatened her in some way.  
之前那股淡淡的担忧开始转化为熟悉的胃里蝴蝶飞舞的感觉。丽这样紧张或担忧的样子并不常见。各种可能出错的情景在我脑海中闪过。我在想是否有人伤害了她或以某种方式威胁了她。

I try to keep myself calm as she instructs me to sit down. I go back to where I was previously and watch as she sits down near to me, she gazes down at the ground awkwardly.  
我尽量保持冷静，按照她的指示坐下。我回到之前的位置，看着她在我附近坐下，她尴尬地低头看着地面。

"What's wrong Rei? Did somebody hurt you?"  
“怎么了，丽？有人伤害你了吗？”

She looks up at me and shakes her head, "No, it is nothing like that but there is something that happened on my recent holiday that you need to know."  
她抬头看着我，摇了摇头，“不，不是那样的，但最近假期发生了一件事，你需要知道。”

"You mean in America? What happened Rei?"  
"你是说在美国？丽发生了什么事？"

Again, scenarios begin to flash through my mind. Did someone take advantage of Rei in America? Did someone threaten her or hurt her in some way? I find it hard to believe someone could have hurt her with the security watching us but then I wonder if maybe she met someone there and they hurt her. I know that unlike myself she has actively dated people, both male and female and has experimented in those ways.  
又一次，各种情景开始在我脑海中闪现。是不是有人在美洲占丽便宜？有人威胁她或以某种方式伤害她吗？我很难相信有人能在我们的安保下伤害她，但随即我又想，也许她在那里遇到了某个人，而那个人伤害了她。我知道，与我自己不同，她积极地与男女都约会过，并在那些方面进行过尝试。

I swallow and wait for her to reply, "Yes, only this incident did not occur in America. I was... In Germany when it occurred. There was something in Germany that I wished to see but then this happened. This is the reason I cut my holiday short. I should have told you sooner about my being in Germany but there were things that needed to be worked out."  
我咽了咽口水，等待她的回答，“是的，只是这件事并非发生在美国。我当时……在德国。那里有我想看的东西，但随后就发生了这件事。这就是我提前结束假期的原因。我本该早点告诉你我在德国的事，但有些事情需要解决。”

I feel a brief sense of relief knowing no one hurt her but was this all she had to tell me? That she was in Germany and then got called to come back. Is this just about her being in Germany and not telling me. I know I worry about her but she doesn't need to tell me everything. On occasion she has been guilty of telling me too much.  
得知没人伤害她，我感到一阵短暂的宽慰，但这就是她要告诉我的全部吗？她在德国，然后被叫回来了。难道只是因为她去了德国却没有告诉我？我知道我担心她，但她不需要告诉我所有事情。偶尔，她也会因为告诉我太多而感到内疚。

Besides Rei is an adult, she can go wherever she wants. I give her a reassuring smile.  
再说了，丽是个成年人，她想去哪儿就去哪儿。我向她露出一个安心的微笑。

"That's fine Rei, I know you've been to Germany before and I know you like it there. I'm guessing Misato found out and asked you to come back early then, I know she can be overprotective of us."  
“没关系，丽，我知道你以前去过德国，而且你喜欢那里。我猜是美里发现了，然后让你提前回来了，我知道她对我们有点过度保护。”

"That was not the end of my story." She says with a hint of impatience in her voice, "The reason I was called back early was not because of my being in Germany but because of what I witnessed whilst there, or at least who I witnessed."  
“那并非我故事的终结。”她带着一丝不耐烦的语气说道，“我被提前召回的原因并非我在德国，而是我在那里目睹了某些事情，或者更确切地说，是目睹了某个人。”

I say absolutely nothing as I sit there in a mixture of confusion and worry. That uneasy feeling I had moments before has returned as I wonder why Rei is so worried about telling me this. I wonder just who or what she could have seen. If it was this bad then it must in some way concern me but I don't understand what it is.  
我坐在那里，一言不发，心中混杂着困惑与忧虑。之前那种不安的感觉再次袭来，我不禁疑惑为何丽为何如此担心告诉我这件事。我好奇她究竟看到了谁或什么。如果情况如此糟糕，那必然与我有关，但我却无法理解其中的缘由。

Unless... I don't think that could be it but what if... What if after all these years she has finally been seen again. She is from Germany so it'd make sense for her to be there and I know Rei would have issues telling me if she saw her.  
除非...我不认为可能是那样，但如果...如果经过这么多年，她终于再次被发现了呢。她来自德国，所以她在那里出现也合情合理，而且我知道，如果丽看到了她，她会有很多顾虑告诉我。

I feel a lump in my throat as I prepare for Rei to say her name. This is a moment I've been waiting for ever since she left. I feel a mixture of fear and excitement, what if it really was her? How am I actually going to feel if Rei does say her name? Excited? Happy? I don't know. I also wonder what it matters if it was her. It's not like she would want to come back here and I don't think we could ever be friends again.  
我感到喉咙哽咽，准备迎接丽说出她的名字。自从她离开后，这一刻我一直在等待。我心中混杂着恐惧与兴奋，如果真的是她呢？如果丽真的说出她的名字，我会是什么感觉？兴奋？高兴？我不知道。我也想知道，如果是她又有什么关系呢。她不可能想回到这里，我也不认为我们还能再做朋友。

I know she hates me for the things I did to her and I can't blame her. It's probably best she does stay away because I'd only hurt her again. I just want to know she is okay though, that she is happy and doing well. I feel Rei's hand around mine as she reveals to me the person she saw.  
我知道她恨我，因为我对她所做的一切，我无法责怪她。也许她最好还是远离，因为我只会再次伤害她。但我只想知道她是否安好，是否快乐，是否过得好。丽握住我的手，向我透露她见到的那个人。

"I saw Kaworu Nagisa." “我见到了渚薰。”

I blink. I blink once more and then all the excitement, all the fear and all the other feelings within me are replaced briefly by a strange numb sensation as I try to process what Rei just said to me. The name floats around my head for a few moments and then I start to feel that lump in my throat swell.  
我眨了眨眼。再次眨眼后，所有的兴奋、恐惧和其他情绪在我体内短暂地被一种奇怪的麻木感所取代，我试图理解丽刚才对我说的话。那个名字在我脑海中飘荡了一会儿，然后我开始感觉到喉咙里的肿块在膨胀。

I look at Rei aware that my eyes are widening. I want to ask her to say that name again but I can't. I can't open my mouth, it's as if my jaw has been wired shut. All at once images flash back to me of my meeting with Kaworu. Images of us talking at the beach, of us doing our sync tests and me staying in his room. Finally, the images turn darker, the descent into Central Dogma, the fight with Unit 02 and then opening Unit 01s hand to reveal that horror of what I had done to Kaworu.  
我看着丽，意识到我的眼睛在睁大。我想让她再说一遍那个名字，但我做不到。我无法张开嘴，仿佛我的下巴被固定住了。突然间，我与薰相遇的画面闪回脑海。我们海滩上的对话，我们的同步测试，我在他房间里的情景。最后，画面变得阴暗，中央教条区的下降，与二号机的战斗，然后打开初号机的手，揭示我所做的对薰的恐怖。

I wonder if maybe I misheard her. Maybe it was another name but I know how idiotic that sounds. Rei wouldn't make a mistake like that, if she saw Kaworu then she saw Kaworu and that was that. I keep my mouth shut firmly, this time not because it feels like it's wired shut but through fear that if I open it I'll be sick.  
我想我可能听错了。也许那是另一个名字，但我知道这听起来多么愚蠢。丽不会犯那样的错误，如果她看到了薰，那就是薰。我紧紧闭上嘴，这次不是因为感觉它被固定住了，而是因为害怕如果我张开嘴，我会呕吐。

I can't believe that he could be alive. I can't believe that Kaworu, my friend for such a brief moment of my life is somehow alive. The boy who befriended me when I had no one else. The boy who betrayed me and the boy that I murdered.  
我无法相信他还活着。我无法相信，在我生命中如此短暂的一瞬结识的朋友——渚薰，竟然还活着。那个在我孤独无依时与我结交的男孩。那个背叛了我，又被我亲手杀死的男孩。

I don't know how to feel about it. Should I be happy at this news? Happy that he came back too along with so many others? Should I be sad or angry at him? I've always tried so hard to not think about Kaworu. I've always tried to put him out of my mind. It's the one memory that I never wanted to revisit and yet I've revisited it so many times over the years. Every moment of our brief couple of days has been replayed in detail in my dreams from the moment I first laid eyes to to his death.  
我不知该如何面对这个消息。我应该为此感到高兴吗？高兴他和那么多人一起回来了？还是应该对他感到悲伤或愤怒？我一直努力不去想渚薰。我一直试图将他从我的脑海中抹去。这是我最不想重温的记忆，然而多年来我却无数次地重温它。从我第一次见到他到他死去的那一刻，我们短暂几天的每一个瞬间都在我的梦中详细重现。

I feel like I should hate him. I know what he did, he took advantage of me and betrayed me. I sunk to my lowest point after that, I did things that were horrible to Asuka and I did nothing as Misato died trying to help me. Yet I cannot hate him. I feel like there was more to him than what I knew, I always wanted to know what that was. I always felt strongly about him, perhaps not as strong as I felt her her but there was something.  
我觉得我应该恨他。我知道他做了什么，他利用了我，背叛了我。那之后我跌入了最低谷，我对明日香做了可怕的事，而当美里试图帮助我时，我却无动于衷地看着她死去。然而我无法恨他。我觉得他还有我不知道的一面，我一直想知道那是什么。我对他总有一种强烈的情感，或许不如我对她的感情那么强烈，但确实存在某种东西。

"I apologize that I did not tell you sooner." Rei interupts my train of thought, "I promise you though, no harm will come to you from him. I will protect you Shinji."  
“我很抱歉没有早点告诉你。” 绫波打断了我的思绪，“但我向你保证，他不会对你造成任何伤害。我会保护你的，真嗣。”

I look back towards Rei, "P-P-Protect me... No... No I don't... I... Ka-Kaworu wouldn't... He..."  
我回头看向绫波，“保-保-保护我...不...不，我不...我...渚薰不会...他...”

Rei runs her thumbs over my hand, "I know what he was and what he did to you. You don't need to be afraid of him, he can't and won't hurt you again."  
绫波用拇指轻抚我的手，“我知道他曾经是什么样的人，以及他对你的所作所为。你不必害怕他，他不能再也不会伤害你了。”

"I-I-I..." I start to stutter and close my mouth again. I have nothing to say to Rei, all I can feel now is the numbness spreading throughout my body. I can feel my chest tighten and my breathing becomes more difficult. Rei quickly moves to sit herself beside me and wraps her arm around my shoulder. My vision blurs as I try to steady my breathing, I try to remember what I've been told whenever this happens. It's been so long since it's happened.  
“我...我...我...”我开始结巴，然后再次闭上了嘴。面对丽，我无话可说，只感到全身麻木在蔓延。我能感觉到胸口发紧，呼吸也变得困难。丽迅速坐到我身边，用胳膊搂住我的肩膀。我努力稳定呼吸，视线却开始模糊，试图回想起每次这种情况发生时别人告诉我的应对方法。已经很久没有发生过了。

Rei wraps me in a warm hug and whispers, "It is okay brother, just breathe. I know this is difficult for you."  
丽给了我一个温暖的拥抱，轻声说：“没事的，哥哥，慢慢呼吸。我知道这对你来说很难。”

**Rei Ayanami 绫波零**

I hold my trembling brother tightly in my arms and wait for his anxiety attack to subside. I'm hit with an overwhelming sense of guilt as I sit there and realize that I have been a terrible sister with what I have done to him. I should have told him this sooner but my failure to act has now only ended up hurting him.  
我紧紧抱着颤抖的弟弟，等待他的恐慌发作平息。坐在那里，我被一股强烈的愧疚感击中，意识到自己作为姐姐是多么糟糕，我对他所做的一切。我本该早点告诉他，但我的不作为现在只让他受了伤。

Seeing his reaction to this only makes me think about how he would react were he to learn about the other secret I am keeping from him. I've been close to telling him about it in the past but now more than ever I feel like he needs to know that she is alive and well. That he needs to know she is still out there but I also feel like I am too deep in my lie.  
看到他对这件事的反应，我不禁思考起如果他得知我隐瞒的另一个秘密，会有何反应。过去我曾几度接近向他坦白，但现在我比任何时候都强烈地觉得，他需要知道她还活着，过得很好。他需要知道她仍在某处，但我同时也深陷于自己的谎言之中。

I'm afraid, not only of his reaction to learning she is alive but also of his reaction to finding out I kept it hidden from him for three years. I know eventually the truth will come out, that is the way of these things but I am afraid of what will happen when it does. It is not only Shinji's reaction that I fear but also Misato's, the woman who took me in and gave me a home for these past years.  
我害怕的不仅是他得知她还活着的反应，还有他发现我隐瞒了三年的真相时的反应。我知道真相终将大白，这是这类事情的必然，但我害怕真相揭晓时会发生什么。我不仅担心真嗣的反应，也担心美里——这位在过去几年里收留我并给我一个家的女人的反应。

I also fear her reaction as well were I to tell them without her permission. I know she wants to keep herself hidden from them and whilst I disagree with her that she should I promised to keep her secret. I would be betraying one of my best friends if I did that, I would also be confirming her fears that everyone would eventually betray her.  
我也害怕未经她允许就告诉他们她的秘密，她的反应会如何。我知道她想避开他们，虽然我不赞同她这样做，但我承诺过保守她的秘密。如果我那样做，就等于背叛了我最好的朋友之一，也会证实她对所有人最终都会背叛她的恐惧。

I just want these people, the ones who I love to be happy and safe and thanks to Nagisa I can no longer feel that they are. Thanks to Nagisa my ideal little world has been torn apart, I did not like keeping the secret before this but it was manageable. With Nagisa there there is a risk, not just to us but to Asuka as well. I don't care what Fuyutsuki tells us, that boy cannot be trusted.  
我只希望我所爱的人能幸福和安全，但多亏了渚，我再也无法感受到他们是如此。多亏了渚，我理想中的小世界已被撕裂，虽然之前保守这个秘密并不容易，但还能应付。有了渚在，不仅我们，还有明日香也面临风险。我不在乎冬月老师怎么说，那男孩不可信任。

"I apologize again Shinji, I know the memory of Nagisa hurts you. I am sorry that I did not tell you about his return sooner but…"  
“再次向真嗣道歉，我知道渚的记忆让你痛苦。很抱歉我没有早点告诉你他回来的事，但是……”

Shinji releases himself from our embrace and shakes his head whilst smiling at me, "N-No… It's fine, I understand why you didn't. I am… I'm not the easiest person when it comes to something like this. I'm sorry I make things so difficult for you. I'm sorry I'm not stronger or better yet!"  
真嗣从我们的拥抱中挣脱出来，摇着头对我微笑，“不……没关系，我理解你为什么没说。我……在这种事情上，我不是最容易相处的人。对不起，我让你这么为难。对不起，我不够坚强，还不够好！”

"Idiot!" I reply to him sharply and silence him by claming my fingers around his lips, "You have nothing to apologize for Shinji. You do not need to be 'stronger' or 'better' you are who you are, you should not apologize for things which you do not need to apologize for."  
"傻瓜！" 我尖锐地回应他，用手指紧贴他的嘴唇让他安静下来，"真嗣，你没有必要道歉。你不需要变得'更坚强'或'更好'，你就是你，不应该为那些不需要道歉的事情道歉。"

I remove my hand and to my surprise he actually lets out a laugh, "You know… You almost reminded me of… Well you know who I mean. When you told me off it sounded just like she did."  
我移开手，令我惊讶的是他竟然笑了出来，"你知道吗……你几乎让我想起了……嗯，你知道我说的是谁。你训斥我的时候，听起来和她一模一样。"

I try to ignore that feeling of guilt swelling inside of me as he talks about Asuka. I try to cast the thought of her aside. I cannot tell them yet about her. Not after he has just learned about Nagisa. Instead I must focus on making him feel better, focus on helping him in the here and now.  
他提到明日香时，我努力忽视内心涌起的愧疚感。我试图抛开关于她的念头。在他刚刚得知渚的事情后，我还不能告诉他们关于她的事。相反，我必须集中精力让他感觉好些，专注于在此刻帮助他。

"I apologize, I do not mean to insult you."  
"我道歉，无意冒犯你。"

Shinji carries on smiling, "No… You didn't insult me. You were right Rei and when she used to say it she was right. I do… apologize too much, I know it myself and I try hard not to. It's just too easy to do so, it's too easy to blame myself for everything…"  
真嗣继续微笑着，"不…你没有冒犯我。你说得对，丽，她以前这么说也是对的。我确实…道歉得太多了，我自己也知道，并且努力不去这样做。只是太容易了，把一切都归咎于自己太容易了…"

"I feel that, despite how harsh she could be that sometimes Soryu did have a point regarding us all."  
"我觉得，尽管她有时可能很严厉，但关于我们所有人，索留有时候确实说得有道理。"

Shinji nods, "Yeah… Do… Do you miss her Rei? I know you two never really got along."  
真嗣点头，“嗯……你……你会想念她吗，绫波？我知道你们俩一直不太合得来。”

"Yes I do. I would have liked to have had the opportunity to know her better and perhaps be her friend. I regret how cold I was towards her in the past and I think I would have liked to correct that. The truth is I did come to admire Soryu in a number of ways, I admired her strength, her fierceness and her compassion."  
“是的，我会想念她。我本希望能有机会更好地了解她，或许成为她的朋友。我后悔过去对她那么冷淡，我想我本希望能改正这一点。事实上，我确实在许多方面敬佩惣流，我敬佩她的坚强、她的勇敢以及她的同情心。”

"I know what you mean, she always had a way of getting us fired up and… she always made sure to include everyone."  
“我明白你的意思，她总是有办法让我们充满干劲，而且……她总是确保每个人都包括在内。”

"Yes, I was always appreciative of that." I reply to him, "At first I found her attempts to pull me into the group irritating but… I look back on it fondly. I now appreciate those moments."  
"是的，我一直很感激那一点。" 我回答他，"起初我觉得她试图拉我进团体的举动很烦人，但……现在回想起来，我感到很温馨。我现在很珍惜那些时刻。"

"Yeah… Do you… Do you think she is alright?"  
"嗯……你……你觉得她还好吗？"

"I do. Wherever Soryu is now I believe she is doing fine."  
"我相信是的。无论曹现在在哪里，我相信她一切都好。"

Shinji bows his head, "I hope so Rei, she deserves to be happy."  
真嗣低下头，“我也希望如此，丽，她值得幸福。”

That feeling of guilt, the lead in my soul continues to weigh down heavily on my heart as I hear Shinji speak. Yet I can do nothing about it, all I can do is sit there and pretend I don't know anything about Asuka or her current condition. I have to pretend that I don't know that she misses him as much as he misses her. I have to replace the 'I know' and 'She is' with 'I believe' and 'I hope.'  
那种愧疚感，我灵魂中的铅块继续沉重地压在心上，当我听到真嗣说话时。然而我对此无能为力，我只能坐在那里，假装对明日香或她目前的状况一无所知。我必须假装不知道她和他一样思念对方。我必须用“我相信”和“我希望”来代替“我知道”和“她是”。

I'm sorry Shinji, I have not been a good sister to you.  
对不起，真嗣，我没有成为一个好姐姐。

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

**Berlin – Late Evening 柏林 —— 深夜**

I try to keep my eyes on the large screen as my fingers press down on the controllers trigger and the car continues to drive forward. It moves down a large dip in the road and starts to gain speed, I slow it just enough in order to take the next sharp corner. As it turns the corner I watch as the back of the car starts to spin out, I try to remember the advice I've read for this and adjust for it. I'm able to get it back under control and the car now drives forward on a long straight.  
我努力将目光锁定在大屏幕上，手指按下控制器的扳机，汽车继续前行。它驶入道路的一个大下坡，速度开始增加，我及时减速以应对下一个急转弯。转弯时，我看到车尾开始打滑，我试图回忆起之前读过的建议并进行调整。最终，我成功控制住了局面，汽车平稳地沿着一条长直道前行。

I keep on driving it forward, being careful to watch my speed knowing that I can't make any mistakes. On screen it drives through a large puddle and little droplets of water splash up onto the games camera and partially obscures my view. I allow myself a quick glance at the minimap, just one more corner and I'll be finished.  
我继续小心翼翼地驾驶，时刻注意速度，深知不能有任何差错。屏幕上，汽车穿过一片大水坑，水花四溅，游戏摄像头的视野被部分遮挡。我快速瞥了一眼小地图，再过一个弯道，我就完成了。

Finally the car crosses the finish line and I feel a genuine sense of accomplishment. My results flash up on screen, third place, whilst I did not win it is still much better than I did when I first bought the game. I lean forward and sit the controller down on my coffee table. I let out a soft groan as I feel a twinge in my ribs, a reminder of what happened to me only a couple of hours ago.  
终于，赛车越过了终点线，我感受到了一种真正的成就感。我的成绩显示在屏幕上，第三名，虽然没有夺冠，但这比我刚买游戏时好多了。我向前倾身，将控制器放在咖啡桌上。我轻轻地呻吟了一声，肋骨处传来一阵刺痛，提醒我几个小时前发生的事情。

The game goes back to the main title screen and I contemplate having another race but I decide against it. I instead look towards my hallway nervously, hoping that Asuka will return to me soon. She said that she would try to be as quick as possible but we found that getting her a taxi back to her place on this particular night was difficult.  
游戏回到了主标题屏幕，我考虑再来一场比赛，但还是决定放弃。我紧张地望向走廊，希望明日香能尽快回来。她说她会尽量快些，但今晚我们发现给她叫一辆回她家的出租车很困难。

Naturally my mind jumps directly to the worst case scenarios. What if she too has been attacked as I was? I wonder if maybe I should have gone with her but my condition would not allow it. I did offer but she was very forceful in telling me that I had to stay here and rest. I did not wish to argue with her.  
自然而然，我的脑海直接跳到了最坏的情况。如果她也像我一样被袭击了怎么办？我在想，也许我应该陪她一起去，但我的身体状况不允许。我确实提出过，但她非常坚决地告诉我必须留在这里休息。我不想和她争论。

My mind jumps to another scenario, what if she doesn't come back? What if what has happened has reminded her of what it is I was and she has turned her back on me. I would not blame her and yet I really hope that is not what has happened. I am thankful for her friendship and adore her company. Whilst the circumstances of our being brought together tonight were not how I would have liked them to be I find myself glad that she is here.  
我的思绪跳跃到另一个场景，如果她不回来了怎么办？如果发生的事情让她想起了我曾经的样子，她会不会已经转身离开了我。我不会怪她，但我真的希望事情不是这样。我感激她的友谊，喜欢她的陪伴。尽管今晚我们相遇的情景并非我所愿，但我还是很高兴她在这里。

I cast that second thought out of my mind. If Asuka had no intention of returning she would not have took a copy of the key to the apartment. Nor would she have said she would return. I do not believe Asuka would be the sort to break such a promise. Yet without her here now I start to feel the fear and vulnerability set in.  
我抛开了第二个念头。如果明日香没有回来的打算，她就不会拿走公寓钥匙的副本，也不会说她会回来。我不认为明日香会是那种违背承诺的人。然而，她现在不在这里，我开始感到恐惧和脆弱袭来。

Worst of all I am beginning to feel that I deserved what happened to me. I feel that those people were right in attacking me and that maybe I actually deserved worse. I let out a sigh and bring my feet up onto the couch hugging my knees to my chest. I can feel the tears welling up in my eyes once more. I dislike this fear and pain so much and I dislike the voice I my head telling me what I deserve it even moreso.  
最糟糕的是，我开始觉得自己活该遭受这一切。我觉得那些攻击我的人是对的，也许我真的应该受到更严重的惩罚。我叹了口气，把脚抬到沙发上，抱紧膝盖。我能感觉到泪水再次在眼眶中打转。我非常讨厌这种恐惧和痛苦，更讨厌脑海中那个告诉我这是应得的声音。

I do not want to feel this way anymore. I want to believe Asuka and Fuyutsuki when they say to me that my actions all those years ago weren't all my fault. I want to believe them when they say that I was a victim but I don't feel like I was a victim. I can still remember everything, I can remember each and every thought I had on that day, the day I betrayed my first ever friend and tore their world apart.  
我不想再这样下去了。我想相信明日香和冬月老师，他们说我多年前所做的一切并不全是我的错。我想相信他们说我是受害者，但我并不觉得自己是受害者。我仍然记得一切，我记得那天我背叛了我的第一个朋友，撕裂了他们的世界时，每一个念头。

I remember thinking that humanity had reached its natural conclusion, that it was no longer worthy of this world and time for them to move on and be replaced. I can remember thinking that because that is what they told me. They told me that humanity had to die and I believed it. I believed it right up until I saw Lilith in that chamber. Then I knew… I knew I was little more than a puppet and that all there was for me was death. Yet I embraced it because death would be my escape, an end to the risk I posed those people and an end to the loneliness I felt being the soul being of my kind.  
我记得当时认为人类已经走到了自然终结的时刻，不再配得上这个世界，是时候让他们离开，被取代了。我记得这样想是因为他们这样告诉我的。他们说人类必须灭亡，我信以为真。直到我看到那个房间里的莉莉丝，我才明白……我知道自己不过是傀儡，我的结局只有死亡。然而我接受了它，因为死亡将是我的解脱，结束我对那些人的威胁，也结束我作为同类中唯一灵魂的孤独。

I'm snapped from my thoughts by a sudden noise from the hallway. I jump in fright and hug my knees closer to my chest as the door opens. A moment later Asuka calls out to me, "I'm back, sorry I took so damn long. Took me a while to find my stuff and then the damn taxi refused to wait so I had to call Fuyutsuki to send a car for me and…"  
一阵突如其来的走廊噪音将我从思绪中惊醒。我吓了一跳，紧紧抱住膝盖，门随即打开。片刻后，明日香对我喊道：“我回来了，抱歉花了这么长时间。找东西花了些时间，然后那该死的出租车不肯等，我只好打电话让冬月派辆车来接我，还有……”

Asuka stops herself in mid-sentence as she enters the room and looks across at me huddled on the sofa. I'm aware of how pathetic I must look but she makes no comment about it. Instead she drops the backpack and makes her way to the sofa and puts an arm around my shoulder. I feel instantly calmed by her warm touch.  
明日香走进房间，看到我蜷缩在沙发上，话说到一半突然停了下来。我知道自己看起来一定很可怜，但她对此只字未提。相反，她放下背包，走到沙发旁，用一只手臂搂住我的肩膀。她温暖的触碰让我立刻感到平静。

From there I see her look up at the screen, my results are still there and she smiled, "Third place! You're getting better Kaworu, still a huge distance from my lap times but definitely better than when you first started! I mean that video you sent me was hilarious."  
接着，我看到她抬头看向屏幕，我的成绩还在上面，她笑了笑说：“第三名！你进步了，真嗣，虽然离我的圈速还有很大差距，但肯定比刚开始时好多了！我是说，你发给我的那个视频真是太搞笑了。”

I let my legs drop to the ground and groan as my ribs ache again. I smile as I turn to her, "I admit I am enjoying the console but I am having some difficulty in adjusting to the games. That video… was not my proudest moment."  
我让双腿垂到地上，随着肋骨再次疼痛而呻吟。我转向她，微笑道：“我承认我很享受这台游戏机，但我还在适应游戏的过程中有些困难。那个视频……并不是我最自豪的时刻。”

"No but making a car do that many flips is an achievement all on its own." Asuka laughs.  
“不，但能让车翻那么多圈本身就是一项成就。”明日香笑着说。

"I am finding that I like this game, it is difficult in places but not overly so to put me off or frustrate me. I am able to easily learn at my own pace and do not feel pressure to succeed. I find that with the shooting games I am struggling to adapt to the control methods, moving the character and camera at the same time is a struggle. That other game you recommended I am having a lot of difficulty progressing in. I have made to a… boss character I believe they are called but it kills me instantly. It is frustrating because with each death I seem to lose any progress I have made."  
“我发现我喜欢这个游戏，虽然有些地方颇具挑战性，但并不至于让我放弃或感到沮丧。我可以按照自己的节奏轻松学习，不会感到成功的压力。我发现自己在射击游戏中很难适应控制方式，同时移动角色和摄像头很困难。你推荐的那个游戏，我在里面进展很艰难。我已经到了一个……应该是叫 Boss 的角色那里，但它立刻就把我干掉了。这很令人沮丧，因为每次死亡似乎都会让我失去所有进展。”

Asuka smirks and nods, "Well I did think that one might be a bit difficult but it is one that everyone should play. You just need to be patient with it, try to watch what the boss does and adjust for it. There are always patterns to the attacks and ways of countering it. As far as the progress goes, well you are spending the points you earn when you kill enemies right?"  
明日香微微一笑，点头道：“嗯，我确实觉得这个可能有点难度，但这是每个人都应该尝试的。你只需要对它有耐心，观察 Boss 的行动并做出相应的调整。攻击总是有模式的，也有应对的方法。至于进度，你是在击杀敌人后正确地使用获得的点数吗？”

I offer her only a blank stare and she shakes her head and sighs, "I should have known! I'll have to show you how it's done won't I?"  
我只能茫然地看着她，她摇摇头叹了口气，“我早该料到的！看来我得亲自示范给你看，对吧？”

"I… Would appreciate that."  
“我……会很感激的。”

"Well don't expect me to do it for you! I'll show you my recordings and give you advice whilst you play. You're not going to improve unless you do it yourself!"  
“别指望我替你做！我会给你看我的录像并给你建议，但你要自己玩。不亲自实践你是不会进步的！”

I can't help but smile at her offer, "That sounds like fun."  
她的话让我不禁微笑，“听起来很有趣。”

Asuka then picks up the controller from the coffee table and shoots me another smile as she sets up a track for herself. I can see that the track seems to be one of the more advanced ones in the game, to go alongside it she picks one of the faster cars.  
接着，明日香从茶几上拿起控制器，又对我笑了笑，为自己选了一条赛道。我看得出这条赛道是游戏里较为高级的，她选了一辆速度更快的赛车来搭配。

"Now, you watch and learn Kaworu. I'll show you how this is done!"  
"现在，你看好了，薰。我会教你这是怎么做到的！"

A little under ten minutes later Asuka crosses the finish line of the track managing to get a time that not only has her in first place but also in the top 250 on the online leaderboards. She triumphantly sets the controller back down and grins, "See, nothing to it! That's how you win a race, patience, smooth driving and no mistakes!"  
不到十分钟后，明日香越过了赛道终点线，她的成绩不仅让她位居第一，还进入了在线排行榜的前 250 名。她得意地将控制器放回原位，笑着说：“看吧，没什么难的！赢得比赛靠的是耐心、平稳驾驶和零失误！”

Whilst Asuka says there was nothing to it I could see quite clearly there was a lot to it and I dread to think how I would fare on that track. I watched it as Asuka skilfully navigated a large number of difficult and sharp turns with ease, looked on as she went through the water hazards and up and down banks without it even affecting her.  
虽然明日香说这没什么，但我清楚地看到这其中有很多技巧，我都不敢想象自己在那条赛道上的表现会如何。我看着明日香熟练地轻松应对大量困难且急转弯，观察她穿越水域障碍，上下坡道，而这一切对她几乎没有影响。

At the same time my eyes were not entirely glued to the screen. I couldn't help it but every now and then I would find myself glancing towards Asuka. She is, in all honesty such a beautiful person. I can't help but feel fortunate to have encountered her and struck up this friendship. She has such a kind soul despite all the pain I know she has suffered. She radiates an aura of confidence that only serves to empower me.  
与此同时，我的目光并未完全锁定在屏幕上。我情不自禁地时不时会瞥向明日香。说实话，她真是一个美丽的人。能遇到她并建立起这份友谊，我感到无比幸运。尽管我知道她经历了许多痛苦，但她拥有一颗善良的心，散发着自信的光芒，这让我也倍感鼓舞。

I feel so safe around her as well. With her here I feel like nothing can harm me. She is wonderful. I'm snapped away from my thoughts of Asuka by a sudden knock at the door. Once again I jump in fright and I feel redness in my cheeks as I quickly pull my eyes away from Asuka.  
在她身边，我感到无比安全。有她在，仿佛没有什么能伤害到我。她真是太棒了。突然的敲门声打断了我的思绪。我又一次被吓了一跳，脸颊泛红，迅速将视线从明日香身上移开。

She leaps up from the sofa, "That'll be the food we ordered! Be back in a second."  
她从沙发上一跃而起，“那应该是我们点的外卖！马上回来。”

Asuka gets up and I find my eyes tracking her as she moves into the passageway to answer the door. My eyes wander all the way down her body and I feel the blush in my cheeks increasing. I try to hastily think about something else than her figure. The more I try the more I can't help it, I feel a strange sort of giddiness in my stomach that I've only ever felt once before when thinking about someone.  
明日香起身，我发现自己不由自主地随着她的移动而目光追随，看着她走向通道去开门。我的视线一路下滑至她的全身，脸上不由得泛起红晕。我急忙试图转移思绪，不去想她的身姿。然而越是努力，越是难以自控，心中涌起一种奇异的兴奋感，这种感觉在我之前想到某个人时也只出现过一次。

A second later I'm hit with that feeling of guilt. I shouldn't be looking at Asuka's figure in such a way or thinking of her like that. I shouldn't be thinking about what it would be like to hold her in my arms. I shouldn't be thinking about what it might feel like to kiss her lips. I definitely shouldn't be thinking about other rogue thoughts that threaten to sneak in there.  
片刻之后，那种愧疚感再次袭来。我不该以这种方式打量明日香的身姿，也不该那样想她。我不该幻想将她拥入怀中的感觉。我不该想象亲吻她双唇的滋味。更不该让那些不正经的念头悄悄溜进脑海。

Thankfully she returns a few seconds later balancing a few large boxes in her hands and with a bottle of something tucked under her arm. I am eagerly anticipating this meal and I can feel my mouth begin to water as the smell from the food infiltrates my nostrils.  
幸好她几秒钟后就回来了，双手稳稳地捧着几个大盒子，腋下还夹着一瓶什么东西。我对这顿饭满怀期待，随着食物的香气钻入鼻孔，我的口水已经开始分泌。

Asuka was somewhat shocked to learn I have not sampled pizza yet. She insisted on ordering from a place she knows, she also insisted on paying. I did try to tell her I would not mind paying but Asuka was very forceful. I did not argue.  
明日香得知我还没尝过披萨，有些惊讶。她坚持要从她知道的一家店订餐，并且执意要付款。我试图告诉她我不介意付钱，但明日香非常坚决。我没有争辩。

As Asuka sets the boxes down on the coffee table and goes to grab some glasses from the kitchen I look at the feast waiting for us and wonder if maybe I was wrong about music. Perhaps this ability to order delicious food and have it delivered to your home is the height of human culture.  
当明日香把盒子放在茶几上，去厨房拿杯子时，我看着等待我们的盛宴，心想或许我对音乐的看法是错的。也许这种能订购美味食物并送货上门的能力，才是人类文化的巅峰。

She returns and we begin to enjoy our food and spend the rest of the night playing games and enjoying ourselves. She shows me how to defeat that boss I was having difficulty with and we play each other a few times on the football game I bought. I even manage to win a couple of matches.  
她回来后，我们开始享用食物，整个晚上都在玩游戏，尽情享受。她教我如何打败那个我之前一直打不过的 Boss，我们还互相在刚买的足球游戏上较量了几局。我甚至赢了几场比赛。

Before long I feel tiredness creep over me and I excuse myself to go to bed. I find a spare duvet and pillows and give them to Asuka before thanking her and bidding her goodnight. I'm about to enter my bedroom when she wishes me goodnight and hugs me, she tells me she hopes I sleep well.  
不久我便感到困意袭来，于是借口去睡觉。我找到一床多余的被子和枕头，递给明日香，然后向她道谢并道晚安。正当我准备进入卧室时，她向我道晚安并拥抱了我，她说希望我能睡个好觉。

As I drift off to sleep that night I find myself cuddling my duvet tight to my chest trying to recapture the feeling of being hugged my Asuka. It is a peculiar feeling to know that what started as one of the most horrific and terrifying nights of my life has somehow managed to change into one of the best. Tonight, I do not feel the guilt and fear I usually do when I try to fall asleep. Instead I feel calm and peaceful as I think of the girl sleeping in the room next to mine.  
那晚入睡时，我发现自己紧紧抱着被子，试图重温被明日香拥抱的感觉。知道这样一个原本恐怖至极的夜晚竟能转变为最美好的时刻之一，这种感觉颇为奇妙。今晚，当我试图入睡时，不再感到往常的愧疚和恐惧。相反，想到隔壁房间里熟睡的女孩，我感到平静而安宁。

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I find myself walking down a street, one I haven't walked down in many years. One that in all honesty shouldn't exist anymore and the clothes I'm wearing are ones that I shouldn't be wearing. Yet here I am in the uniform of the Tokyo-3 Junior High School. I continue to walk down the deserted street towards my destination. Why am I here? Where is everybody?  
我发现自己走在一条街上，一条多年未曾踏足的街道。说实话，这条街本不该存在了，而我身上的衣服也不该是我穿的。然而，我正穿着第三新东京市立初中的校服。我继续向着目的地走去，这条空无一人的街道。我为何会在这里？其他人都去哪儿了？

I round the corner and see the school gates in front of me. Finally I can see people but I freeze upon recognizing exactly who they are. Panic rises up in my chest, it's Kaworu and... and… that boy. They're stood facing one another and talking. They're talking and smiling and laughing and joking with one another. They both look so happy, happier than I've ever seen them.  
我转过街角，眼前便是学校的大门。终于能看到人了，但我一认出他们是谁，便僵住了。恐慌在胸中升起，是渚薰和……那个男孩。他们面对面站着，交谈着。他们在说笑，在欢笑，在互相打趣。他们看起来如此快乐，比我见过的任何时候都要快乐。

I take a step back feeling something else rising up inside of me. It's like a churning in my stomach but not one that makes me feel sick. No it's worse somehow, it's jealousy. Jealousy that I'm watching these two people talking so nonchalantly and I'm not there with them. Jealousy that I'm watching Kaworu take Shinji's hand and slowly raising it to his lips.  
我后退了一步，感觉内心涌起了另一种情绪。像是胃里的翻腾，但又不是那种让人恶心的感觉。不，某种程度上更糟，是嫉妒。嫉妒我看着这两个人如此随意地交谈，而我却不在他们身边。嫉妒我看着渚薰握住真嗣的手，缓缓将其举到唇边。

I try to walk forward but my legs feel heavy. There is nothing but pain as I slowly drag one leg forward. I have to reach them in time. I need to talk to them both but what am I going to say?  
我试图向前走，但双腿沉重。每拖动一步，只有痛苦相伴。我必须及时赶到他们身边。我需要和他们俩谈谈，但我该说什么呢？

_'You're going to tell them what you think of them of course!'  
'你当然要告诉他们你对他们的看法！'_

I hear the girl next to me call out. I try to ignore her.  
我听到旁边的女孩大声说道。我试图忽视她。

_'Look at them both, both the objects of your desire. You one you ran away from and the one you're going to run away from.'  
'看看他们俩，都是你心中的渴望。一个你逃离了，另一个你也将逃离。'_

"No… No I'm not." I reply, "I'm not going to run away from him."  
“不…不，我不是。”我回答，“我不会从他身边逃走的。”

I keep on trying to move forward but my legs, they hurt so goddamn much. Why am I feeling this pain?  
我一直在努力前进，但我的腿，它们疼得要命。为什么我会感到这种痛苦？

_'Yes you are. Of course you are because that's what you have to do. If you don't you know what'll happen. You'll just hurt him, same as you did to Shinji. You're no good for him.'  
“是的，你当然会。因为你必须这么做。如果你不这样做，你知道会发生什么。你会像对待真嗣那样伤害他。你对他没好处。”_

I shake my head, it isn't like that. It isn't like that at all. I'm his friend, I want to be his friend. I don't want to hurt him, I won't hurt him! I promise I won't!  
我摇摇头，事情不是那样的。根本不是那样的。我是他的朋友，我只想做他的朋友。我不想伤害他，我不会伤害他！我保证我不会！

I keep on moving forward, painfully dragging myself forward trying to get to the two of them. They're still stood there talking and laughing. Shinji has his arms around Kaworu's neck now and I feel that churning increase.  
我继续向前移动，痛苦地拖着自己试图接近他们俩。他们还站在那里谈笑风生。真嗣现在正搂着渚薰的脖子，我感到那种翻腾感愈发强烈。

_'You long for that don't you. Long for either one of their embrace but you can't have it. You ran away from him, you can't even bring yourself to speak his name can you? You can't even think his name! It'll be exactly the same for Kaworu, you'll hurt him and you'll run away!'  
"“你渴望那样对吧。渴望他们中的任何一个的拥抱，但你得不到。你从他身边逃走了，你甚至无法提起他的名字，对吧？你甚至无法想起他的名字！对渚薰也会是一样的，你会伤害他，然后再次逃离！”_

I'm about to reach the gates when I hear the bell ring. I try to shout out to the pair of them, my mouth opens as I try to speak Kaworu's name but no words come out. I then try in desperation to say his name but I can't. I don't deserve to speak either of their names. I stop and watch in despair as the two of them walk towards the school hand in hand. There is nothing I can do but stand there propping myself up against the gate.  
我即将到达校门时，听到了铃声响起。我试图向他们两人呼喊，嘴巴张开想要说出渚薰的名字，却发不出任何声音。我绝望地再次尝试呼唤他的名字，但依旧无法做到。我不配叫出他们中任何一个人的名字。我停下脚步，绝望地看着他们手牵手走向学校。除了靠在校门上支撑自己，我无能为力。

As I watch I hear a strange noise. I hear three clicks followed by a loud crack, I turn around and see the version of me who has been taunting me stood there. She's wearing a chef's hat now and carrying a bowl in which she's just cracked a number of eggs into it.  
当我注视着他们时，听到了一个奇怪的声音。先是三声咔哒，紧接着是一声巨响，我转过身，看到那个一直嘲弄我的‘我’站在那里。她现在戴着一顶厨师帽，手里拿着一个碗，刚刚往里面打进了几个鸡蛋。

_'Good morning Asuka!' '早上好，明日香！'_

My eyes slowly open as dream fades away. I feel the sting of tears in my eyes and for some reason I can still feel that churning in my stomach. It was a dream, it was all just another goddamn dream in which I come out of it feeling horrible. Another dream in which I see him and can't even speak to him or get close to him only now Kaworu seems to have made an appearance too.  
我的眼睛缓缓睁开，梦境逐渐消散。我感到眼中有泪水的刺痛，不知为何，胃里那种翻腾的感觉依然存在。那只是一个梦，一切不过是又一个该死的梦，醒来后感觉糟糕透顶。又一个梦，梦中我见到他，却连话都说不出口，也无法靠近他，而现在，渚薰似乎也出现了。

I take a few calming breaths and lay still. My eyes flicker around the space in front of me, I'm in Kaworu's front room. I'm safe and lying on his sofa. In front of me is a coffee table with boxes of pizza and empty glasses. I'm not… I'm not a bad person and I'm not… going to run away. I'm Kaworu's friend, I promised I'd be there for him and he isn't going to abandon me.  
我深呼吸几次，静静躺着。目光在面前的空间游移，我身处渚薰家的客厅。我安全地躺在他的沙发上。眼前是一张咖啡桌，上面摆着披萨盒和空杯子。我不是……我不是坏人，也不会……逃跑。我是渚薰的朋友，我承诺过会支持他，他也不会抛弃我。

A second later my nostrils are hit by an array of pleasant smells. I hear a noise from the kitchen and suddenly sit up and look towards the source of the sound. I see the light is on and Kaworu is stood there looking over a number of pans, breakfast ingredients set out over the counters. I suppose… that explains the eggs.  
片刻后，我的鼻腔被一阵宜人的香气包围。厨房传来声响，我突然坐起身，朝声音的来源望去。看到灯光亮着，渚薰站在那里，俯视着几个平底锅，早餐食材摆满了台面。我想……这解释了鸡蛋的存在。

"K-Kaworu…" I rub my eyes as I call out to him, "What are you doing?"  
"K-Kaworu…" 我揉着眼睛呼唤他，"你在做什么？"

Kaworu slowly turns around and shoots me a smile. I try to smile back at him but in my tired state it turns into a yawn. From here I can still see the effects of the attack last night. I was able to clean up as much as I could and some of the swelling as gone down. He looks rough but it's an improvement over last night. His smile though, his smile seems as sweet as it did when I first saw it.  
Kaworu 缓缓转过身来，向我投以微笑。我试图回以微笑，但在疲惫的状态下却变成了一个哈欠。从这里我仍能看到昨晚攻击的影响。我尽可能地清理了现场，一些肿胀已经消退。他看起来有些憔悴，但比起昨晚有所改善。然而，他的微笑，他的微笑依旧如我初次见到时那般甜美。

"My apologies Asuka, I did not wake you, did I?" He finally says.  
"抱歉，Asuka，我没有吵醒你吧？" 他终于说道。

I shake my head, in truth he did but I'm thankful that he did, I didn't want to see how that dream would have panned out, "No. I was just waking up anyway."  
我摇了摇头，实际上他确实这么做了，但我很感激他，我不想看到那个梦会如何发展，“不，反正我也正要醒来了。”

He turns away for a moment to monitor something in one of the frying pans. Just at that moment I spot some toast pop up out of the toaster. One by one I start to identify the various smells coming from the kitchen and my stomach growls in response. At the same time I can't help but frown at him as I watch him limp over to the toaster.  
他转过身去，查看其中一个煎锅里的东西。就在这时，我看到一些吐司从烤面包机里弹出来。我开始一一辨认厨房里传来的各种香味，我的肚子随之咕噜作响。与此同时，我看着他一瘸一拐地走向烤面包机，忍不住皱起了眉头。

"I thought I told you to rest!" I try to sound commanding but let out another yawn as I finish my sentence, "I said I'd handle things!"  
“我以为我告诉你要休息！”我试图用命令的语气说话，但说完后又打了个哈欠，“我说过我会处理这些事的！”

Kaworu lowers his head and smiled back at me, "I know but I would not feel right you doing everything for me and also, I wanted to repay your kindness in some way. I have heard that breakfast in bed is seen as a kind gesture among humans and thought you would appreciate it. I am unable to do many things but cooking is something that I feel I am competent at."  
渚薰低下头，对我微笑着说：“我知道，但我不希望你为我做所有事情，而且，我也想以某种方式回报你的好意。我听说在人类中，床上早餐被视为一种体贴的举动，我想你会喜欢的。虽然我做不了很多事情，但烹饪是我感觉自己还算擅长的事情。”

I face reddens at his words, he was going to make me breakfast in bed. He was actually going to the effort of doing that for me. All I can do is mumble under my breath, "Idiot… You don't need to repay me for anything."  
听到他的话，我的脸颊泛起了红晕，他竟然要为我做床上早餐。他真的愿意为我付出这样的努力。我只能低声咕哝：“傻瓜……你不需要为我做任何回报。”

I sit on the sofa and watch him moving around the kitchen and I feel myself smiling as I do so. He seems content and happy to be doing this. He seems at peace, just as he did last night when we were playing games together. As I watch him I begin to feel that butterfly like churning in my stomach again only this time it isn't jealousy, it's something else entirely and something that should feel nice.  
我坐在沙发上，看着他在厨房里忙碌，不由得微笑起来。他似乎很满足，也很高兴做这些。他显得很平静，就像昨晚我们一起玩游戏时那样。看着他，我再次感到胃里那种蝴蝶般的翻腾，但这次不是嫉妒，而是完全不同的感觉，一种应该让人感到愉悦的感觉。

Except it doesn't feel nice because it frightens me. I shouldn't be allowed to feel this because I can never be that person for anyone. I can never be that person who likes someone and lets them like me back because of who I am.  
只是这种感觉并不美好，因为它让我感到害怕。我不应该有这样的感觉，因为我永远无法成为任何人心目中的那个人。我永远无法成为那种喜欢某人并让他们因为我是谁而喜欢我的人。

I turn away and sit back on the sofa shaking my head. As I do so Rei's warnings enter my mind as well. She warned me to stay away from Kaworu because he is dangerous but it isn't me who should be afraid of him. It's the other way around. Only I can't leave now, I made a promise and I'm not going to break that promise.  
我转过身，坐回到沙发上，摇着头。与此同时，丽的话也浮现在我的脑海中。她警告我要远离渚薰，因为他很危险，但真正应该害怕的不是我，而是他。只是我现在不能离开，我许下了一个承诺，我不会违背那个承诺。

I need to speak to someone but my options are limited to two people. Kaworu or Rei, neither of which seem like good candidates for this conversation. I turn again to see Kaworu is finishing putting things out on the plate and he looks over, "I'm nearly finished do you want me to bring it over to you or shall we eat over here?"  
我需要找人谈谈，但我的选择仅限于两个人。渚薰或丽，似乎都不是合适的谈话对象。我再次转头，看到渚薰正在把东西摆到盘子上，他抬头看向我，“我快准备好了，你想让我把食物端给你，还是我们在这里吃？”

I shake my head, "Over there please, I'll just be a moment."  
我摇摇头，“请到那边去，我马上就好。”

I ignore the previous thoughts. I can't focus on things like this on an empty stomach, I'll eat and enjoy today and then figure out what to do. I start to stand up off of the sofa and as I do I look over towards the lone chair and spot a piece of plain red fabric hanging off of it that looks suspiciously like my nightshirt. I gaze at it again, it is my nightshirt.  
我忽略了之前的思绪。空腹时无法专注于这类事情，我要先吃东西并享受今天，然后再考虑该怎么办。我准备从沙发上站起来，就在这时，我朝那把孤零零的椅子看去，发现上面挂着一块纯红色的布料，看起来很像我的睡衣。我又仔细看了看，确实是我的睡衣。

I lift up the duvet that is wrapped around me and look down to see my exposed breasts and stomach and look back at the nightshirt in horror. I remember what happened now, I woke up in the middle of the night and was too hot. I forgot where I was and removed my shirt throwing it onto the chair. I think about what happened to Kaworu in my apartment and realize something, the universe hates us.  
我掀开裹在身上的被子，低头看到自己裸露的胸部和腹部，惊恐地看向那件睡衣。现在我想起来了，半夜醒来时太热了。我忘了自己在哪里，脱下衬衫扔到了椅子上。我想起在公寓里对渚薰做过的事，意识到一件事，宇宙似乎对我们怀有敌意。

I know the easy thing to do would be to just ask him to get it for me, I know that'd be so simple but I also can't do that. I may as well expose myself to him by doing that, would seem like the same thing. I try to ignore the voice in my head that urges me to expose myself to him. That'd it'd be only fair after what I got to see the other week. I can almost imagine the Asuka from my dream taunting me.  
我知道最简单的办法就是直接让他帮我拿过来，我也知道那样做很简单，但我就是做不到。那样做无异于向他暴露自己，感觉就像是一回事。我努力忽视脑海中那个催促我向他暴露的声音。毕竟上周我看到了不该看的，这样做似乎才公平。我几乎能想象到梦中的明日香在嘲弄我。

_'Go ahead and let him see all of you. You know he's going to like it, you saw him stealing glances at you all of last night. You know he likes you, don't you think he'd appreciate getting to see that?'  
'大胆让他看个够吧。你知道他会喜欢的，昨晚你不是看到他一直在偷瞄你吗？你知道他喜欢你，你不觉得他会欣赏这一幕吗？'_

I tell myself to shut up and start to stretch my hand out towards the chair whilst also using the other one to keep the duvet wrapped around my topless body. Please don't fall, please don't slip, please just let me grab the damn top and put it on. Please don't let him see me.  
我告诉自己闭嘴，一边伸手去够椅子，一边用另一只手紧紧裹住被子，遮住上半身。千万别掉，千万别滑，让我顺利拿到那该死的衣服穿上。千万别让他看到我。

My hand edges closer to the fabric and my fingertips graze the soft material. I did it! I won! I begin to triumphantly grasp the material and then it happens. I feel myself lose balance. My hand around the duvet slips and I snatch at it to keep my modesty in check. My other hand however falls to the ground. I stifle a yelp as it hits the floor with a thud.  
我的手缓缓靠近那布料，指尖轻触柔软的材质。我做到了！我赢了！我开始得意地抓住那布料，然而就在这时，我失去了平衡。抓着被子的手滑了一下，我急忙抓住它以保持体面。但另一只手却落在了地上。我忍住了一声惊呼，它重重地砸在地板上。

I freeze in place as I hear Kaworu's footsteps, "Is everything okay?"  
我僵在原地，听到薰的脚步声，“一切都好吗？”

I quickly fire back, "Fine! I'm fine, breakfast smells great. Is it nearly ready?"  
我迅速回应道，“没事！我很好，早餐闻起来很香。快做好了吗？”

Please turn around, please turn around, please turn around.  
请转过身来，请转过身来，请转过身来。

"I'm just putting it out now. Will be a minute."  
“我现在就拿出来。稍等一下。”

I quickly glance and see he has turned his back, now is my opportunity. I grab the shirt from the floor and throw it on as quick as I can. I'm covered, I can face him now! I cast the duvet aside and brush the hair from my face and stand up. I still feel somewhat strange being in this state in front of Kaworu. I'm not used to exposing this much flesh to people but the nights are so warm I'm hardly going to wear my winter pyjama's  
我迅速瞥了一眼，发现他已经转过身去，现在正是机会。我从地板上抓起衬衫，以最快的速度穿上。我遮住了身体，现在可以面对他了！我掀开被子，拂去脸上的头发，站了起来。在这种状态下站在薰面前，我仍然感到有些不自在。我不习惯在别人面前露出这么多肌肤，但夜晚如此温暖，我总不能穿冬天的睡衣吧。

Still I am at least covered up where it counts. All he is going to see is most of my legs and he can't exactly see my chest unless he really makes an effort to look down my shirt. Something I'm fairly sure Kaworu won't be doing.  
至少在关键部位我还是遮住了的。他能看到的不过是我的大部分腿，除非他真的费劲去窥视我的衬衫下面，否则是看不到我的胸部的。我相当确信，碇不会这么做。

I walk over to the kitchen and stand beside the counter top with one of the plates on it. Kaworu just finishes placing the sausages on the plate and after putting the pan in the sink he turns to look at me. He starts off smiling but then I see a confused look spread across his face. I look at his eyes and they're not looking at my face, they're lower but not on the plates. They're focused on my chest, he wouldn't... be so obvious, would he?  
我走到厨房，站在操作台旁，上面放着几个盘子。碇刚刚把香肠摆放在盘子里，然后把平底锅放进水槽，转身看向我。他一开始微笑着，但随后我看到他脸上浮现出困惑的表情。我看着他的眼睛，它们并没有停留在我的脸上，而是更低的位置，但不是在盘子上。他的目光聚焦在我的胸部，他不会...这么明显吧，会吗？

"Kaworu... What are you staring at?" I start to raise my voice, ready to call him a pervert for being so obvious but then he looks back up at me.  
“碇...你在看什么？”我开始提高声音，准备骂他是个变态，因为他表现得如此明显，但他随即抬头看向我。

"N-Nothing it's just... Your top is..."  
"没、没什么，只是... 你的上衣..."

I look down and then I see the issue. I look back at Kaworu and my mouth opens and closes akin to a goldfish. In my haste to not get spotted I seem to have put my top on back to front, I'd feel less embarrassed if I did just flash my damn tits at him now. Our awkward silence goes on for a few moments longer.  
我低头一看，随即发现了问题所在。我抬头看向渚薰，嘴巴一张一合，活像条金鱼。匆忙之中，我似乎把上衣前后穿反了，现在要是直接露胸给他看，我可能还不会这么尴尬。我们之间的尴尬沉默又持续了几秒钟。

"Excuse me." I say politely as I excuse myself to go to the bathroom and correct my mistake. All the time resisting the urge to slam my foot against the wall.  
""失陪一下。"" 我礼貌地说道，然后借故去洗手间纠正错误。一路上我强忍着用脚踢墙的冲动。

The universe hates me. 这宇宙似乎对我充满了敌意。

**Rei Ayanami 绫波零**

I feel those nerves build up in the pit of my stomach as I hold the phone in my hands and scroll to her name. I still haven't quite worked out what I'm going to say to her yet. I want to ask her about telling Shinji and Misato that she is alive and well. I do not know if I can do this though, I fear what her reaction will be.  
当我手中握着手机，滚动到她的名字时，我感到胃里一阵紧张。我还没完全想好要对她说些什么。我想问她关于告诉真嗣和美里她还活着的事。但我不知道自己能否做到，我害怕她的反应会是什么样。

I'm certain she'll be angry with me, she'll tell me that to do that would be betraying her and by wanting to do this I suppose I am betraying her. Asuka has been through so much pain in her life and she only made one request of me as a friend. It seemed like a simple promise to make and keep at first but now I am realizing that I cannot keep it any longer.  
我确信她会对我生气，她会说我这样做是在背叛她，而想要这么做，我确实是在背叛她。明日香经历了太多生活中的痛苦，她作为朋友只向我提了一个请求。起初，这似乎是一个简单且容易遵守的承诺，但现在我意识到我不能再遵守它了。

At the same time, I am hoping that maybe she will understand why it is I have to do this. With Nagisa reappearing as he has done it has complicated things and it has hurt Shinji. It has made me realize that by keeping this secret I too am hurting Shinji. All he wants to know is that Asuka is alright, I am sure that would help him.  
与此同时，我期待着或许她能理解我为何必须这么做。渚薰的再次出现让事情变得复杂，也让真嗣受到了伤害。这让我意识到，隐瞒这个秘密同样在伤害真嗣。他只想知道明日香是否安好，我相信这会对他有所帮助。

Perhaps if I told them that Asuka is alive and well but also tell her of her desire to stay away until she is ready they will understand. I do not think either would do something so drastic as to go and seek her out. With that said, that is what I did and Misato and Shinji have much more of an attachment to her than I did.  
也许如果我告诉他们明日香还活着且安然无恙，同时也告诉她希望保持距离直到她准备好，他们会理解。我不认为他们中的任何一个会采取如此极端的行动去找她。尽管如此，这正是我所做的，而美里和真嗣与她的羁绊远比我深。

My other fear is as to how Shinji will react. I have been keeping this secret from him for nearly three years, I could have told him at any time and I didn't. I knew all along of the feelings he had for her and the feelings she had for him. I have kept them apart from one another when I could have done so much more. Will my brother be angry with me? Will he hate me for what I have done?  
我另一个担忧是真嗣会如何反应。我对他隐瞒这个秘密近三年，本可以在任何时候告诉他，但我没有。我一直知道他对她的感情以及她对他的感情。我让他们彼此分离，而本可以做更多。我的弟弟会生我的气吗？他会因为我所做的事而恨我吗？

I let out a sigh as my thumb finally presses the call button and the phone starts to dial Germany. A few moments later she answers and I hear a surprisingly happy voice, _"Hallo! Rei, I didn't expect to hear from you, how are you doing?"_  
我叹了口气，终于用拇指按下了呼叫键，电话开始拨打德国。片刻后她接听了，我听到一个出乎意料的欢快声音：“哈喽！丽，没想到会接到你的电话，你还好吗？”

"I am doing well, thank you. How are you?"  
“我很好，谢谢。你呢？”

_"I'm good." “我也不错。”_

I'm about to say something else to her but then I hear something in the background. At first, I think it could be that Asuka has left her television on and I'm hearing whatever show it is she has on. A second later I hear Asuka speak, _"I'll be back in a few moments, I'm just going to take this phone call."_  
我正要对她再说些什么，但这时我听到了背景中的声音。起初，我以为可能是明日香忘了关电视，我听到的是她正在看的节目。过了一会儿，我听到明日香说话，“我一会儿就回来，现在先接个电话。”

There is the sound of movement from the other end of the phone, followed by the sounds of a door closing, _"Sorry about that!"_  
电话那头传来一阵移动的声音，接着是关门声，“抱歉让你久等了！”

I pause for a moment to think about the reason for my phonecall. Asuka has someone there with her, I did not expect that to have happened. Perhaps now is not the best time for this. I should maybe have expected this to happen. Asuka is busy at the moment finishing her second book, I expect she must have things to do and meetings with others.  
我停顿片刻，思考着打电话的原因。明日香身边有人，这是我没预料到的。也许现在不是谈这个的最佳时机。我或许应该预见到这种情况。明日香正忙于完成她的第二本书，我想她肯定有很多事情要做，还要与其他人会面。

"No, I apologize. I did not realize you had company. If I did I would not have called you. I can call you back if it is important."  
"不，我道歉。我没意识到你有客人。如果知道的话，我就不会打电话给你了。如果事情重要，我可以稍后再打给你。"

_"Not at all! It's not important, I'm just... with a friend and we're playing some games together, that's all!"  
"一点儿也不！不重要，我只是……和朋友在一起，我们正在一起玩游戏，就这样！"_

It is a... friend? I feel a small pang of jealousy at hearing that but I quickly force it away. I did not realize Asuka had other friends in Germany, she does not speak of knowing anyone else there and yet it does make sense. She has been there for a few years.  
是个……朋友？听到这个我感到一丝嫉妒，但我很快把它压了下去。我不知道明日香在德国还有其他朋友，她从未提起过在那儿认识任何人，不过这确实说得通。她已经在那里待了几年了。

It seems that my decision has been made for me, I will not speak to Asuka about that matter at this moment in time. I would not wish to upset her when she is with others. Instead I'm about to ask her how her week has been when she speaks.  
看来我的决定已不由我掌控，此刻我不会与明日香谈论那件事。我不希望她在他人面前感到不安。正当我准备问她这周过得如何时，她开口了。

_"Actually... Rei, I was going to call you later."_ She lets out a sigh, _"There is something I wanted to talk to you about."_  
“实际上……丽，我本打算稍后给你打电话。”她叹了口气，“有件事我想和你谈谈。”

I raise an eyebrow out of curiosity, it is unlike Asuka to reach out to me to talk about something. Usually I have to pry things out of her. I sit down on the edge of my bed, "You can talk to me about anything, you know that."  
出于好奇，我挑了挑眉，明日香主动找我谈事情可不常见。通常我得费劲从她那里套话。我坐在床边，“你可以和我谈任何事，你知道的。”

"I know but I think... you might be angry at me for this." She pauses again, "The Friday after you left to go back to Japan... I... I visited Nagisa."  
"我知道，但我想... 你可能会因此生我的气。" 她再次停顿，"你回日本后的那个周五... 我... 我去了渚那里。"

I was certainly not prepared to hear those words from her. I try to not make any sound but feel my hand clench itself into a fist, my nails digging into my palm. I try to not be angry with her, I try to not be angry because I am sure there is a reasonable explanation.  
听到她这些话，我确实毫无准备。我努力不发出任何声音，但感觉到自己的手紧握成拳，指甲深深陷入掌心。我试图不生她的气，试图不生气，因为我确信有合理的解释。

I just do not understand how, after all my warnings, after all I told her about just who and what Nagisa was! How could she have just ignored me like that. It seems so typical of her, so foolish of her, why would she do such a thing?  
我就是不明白，在我多次警告她，在我告诉她渚是谁、是什么样的人之后！她怎么能就这样无视我。这似乎太典型了，太愚蠢了，她为什么要做这样的事？

She couldn't have even known that he was human when she made that decision. She must have known the risk she was putting herself in.  
她做出那个决定时，甚至可能不知道他是人类。她一定知道自己所冒的风险。

_"You're mad at me, aren't you?"_ Asuka asks me.  
"你在生我的气，对吧？" 明日香问我。

"No!" I reply bluntly not doing a very good job of hiding my anger.  
"没有！" 我直截了当地回答，没能很好地掩饰我的愤怒。

_"Heh."_ Asuka laughs, _"You know... I don't blame you, considering who he is and what you told me you have every reason to be."_  
"呵呵。" 明日香笑道，"你知道的……我不怪你，考虑到他的身份和你告诉我的那些事，你有充分的理由这么做。"

"Why did you visit him?" I ask her, "I warned you about him and what he was. I do not understand why you would put yourself at risk like that."  
"你为什么要去看他？" 我问她，"我警告过你关于他的事。我不明白你为何要冒这样的险。"

_"Because I'm Asuka Langley Soryu of course!"_ She replies in a mocking tone, _"Because I can handle myself and take care of myself. Because I've never been good at taking advice that is good for me and... I was curious about him. I saw him run away from me Rei, I had to know why he was terrified of me and I had to know what he was for myself. I had to... You know what, I don't know the full reason myself, I just did!"_  
"因为我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷当然！" 她用嘲讽的语气回答，"因为我能照顾好自己。因为我从不擅长接受对我有益的建议，而且……我对他的好奇心驱使着我。我看到他逃离我，丽，我必须知道他为何害怕我，我必须亲自了解他是什么样的人。我必须……你知道吗，我自己也不完全清楚原因，我就是这么做了！"

As she says these things my brain makes a sudden yet bizarre leap. That voice I heard previously, the male friend she has over. It could not be... could it? He couldn't possibly be there right now, could he? Such an event seems... inconceivable. I can understand her need to satiate her curiosity but further interaction with Nagisa would be a move ill-fitting my friend.  
当她说这些话时，我的思绪突然跳跃到了一个奇怪的地方。之前我听到的那个声音，她提到的那个男性朋友。不可能是...吧？他现在不可能在那里，对吧？这样的事情似乎...难以置信。我能理解她满足好奇心的需要，但与渚进一步接触对我朋友来说并不合适。

"What did you find out?" I ask her, no longer making an attempt to hide my annoyance.  
“你发现了什么？”我问她，不再掩饰我的不悦。

_"I found out he's terrified Rei, he's scared of everything. He was terrified of me and he barely even knew who I was. I was nothing more than a name on a file he had read and yet he was terrified of me."  
“我发现他很害怕怜，他对一切都感到恐惧。他对我感到害怕，他几乎不认识我。我只是他读过的档案上的一个名字，而他却对我感到害怕。”_

"Good, he has every reason to be afraid of you." I reply, "Especially now that he is human, he knows people can hurt him."  
"很好，他有充分的理由害怕你。" 我回答，"特别是现在他变成了人类，他知道人们可以伤害他。"

_"You knew about that?" "你知道这件事？"_

"Misato spoke to Fuyutsuki about him reappearing. We found out when Nagisa returned and why he is in Germany."  
"美里和冬月谈过他再次出现的事。我们是在渚回来后才知道他在德国的原因。"

_"Yeah... Fuyutsuki helped him out... Does... Well does your brother know about him?"  
"是啊...冬月老师帮了他...那...呃，你哥哥知道他吗？"_

My mind goes back to my earlier conversation with Shinji and his reaction to Kaworu's return. Shinji seems to be alright now. I heard him playing the cello earlier and he seemed to be happy during dinner. I will check on him after this phone call.  
我的思绪回到了之前与真嗣的对话以及他对渚薰归来的反应。真嗣现在似乎没事了。我之前听到他在拉大提琴，晚餐时他看起来也很开心。这通电话结束后我会去看看他。

"I told him earlier today."  
"今天早些时候我告诉他了。"

_"I see, how... did he take it?"  
"我明白了，他...是怎么接受这件事的？"_

"He took it hard." I'm honest with her, "What happened with Nagisa hurt him badly, not just because of what Nagisa did but because of what Shinji was forced to do. You remember I told you about that?"  
"他很难过。" 我诚实地告诉她，"渚的事情对他打击很大，不仅仅是因为渚做了什么，还因为真嗣被迫做了什么。你记得我跟你提过吗？"

_"Yes... He had to kill Nagisa I..."  
"是的... 他不得不杀了渚，我..."_

"I will protect Shinji from Nagisa, I do not wish to see my brother hurt like that again."  
"我会保护真嗣不受渚的伤害，我不希望再看到我的弟弟那样受伤。"

_"I understand Rei it's just... I don't think... Nagisa is as you think he's... terrified of the world and barely knows how to live he..."  
"我理解你，丽，只是...我不认为...渚像你想的那样...他对这个世界感到恐惧，几乎不知道如何生活..."_

She pauses as she tries to search for the right words, finally she speaks again, "He's not that different to us Rei."  
她停顿了一下，试图寻找合适的词句，最终再次开口，"他并不比我们更不同，丽。"

On hearing her say that I feel my anger rise in my chest. How can Asuka say such a thing to me when she knows, she knows exactly what Nagisa did to my brother? She knows what Shinji went through and she knows what Kaworu did. How can she think that Nagisa is in any way similar to any of us?  
听到她这么说，我感到胸中的怒火升腾。阿斯卡怎么能对我说这样的话，她明明知道，她完全清楚渚对我哥哥做了什么？她知道真嗣经历了什么，也知道薰做了什么。她怎么还能认为渚和我们中的任何一个有相似之处呢？

"Nagisa is very different to us!" I reply, "He was aware of what he was and what he was doing. He could have stopped himself, it was all within his power. If he has told you otherwise it is a lie Asuka! He is the enemy."  
“渚和我们完全不同！”我反驳道，“他清楚自己是谁，也清楚自己在做什么。他本可以阻止自己，这一切都在他的掌控之中。如果他对你说了别的，那是谎言，阿斯卡！他是敌人。”

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I hear Rei raise her voice at me down the phone and all I can do is stare at it in quiet amazement. A part of me wants to laugh at hearing an irate Rei Ayanami. I don't laugh though because this isn't a laughing matter. I feel a queasiness in my stomach as I wonder how I'm going to explain the rest of what has happened regarding Kaworu to Rei. I don't even know if I can or should, Rei is so protective of her brother and any threat to him.  
我听到电话那头丽提高了声音，我只能静静地盯着它，心中满是惊讶。有一部分我想笑，听到生气的丽·绫波让我觉得好笑。但我没有笑，因为这不是笑的时候。我感到胃里一阵恶心，不知道该如何向丽解释关于薰的其他事情。我甚至不知道我是否能或者应该这样做，丽对她哥哥的保护欲太强，任何对他构成威胁的事情都让她紧张。

It is difficult to blame her for that though, after the things that I put him through and the pain and suffering inflicted on him by others in his life she has to be. Not only that but she feels she owes her current life and happiness to him. I don't blame her for seeing Kaworu as a threat and someone who would hurt Shinji.  
尽管如此，要责怪她确实很难，毕竟我让他经历的那些事，以及他一生中其他人施加给他的痛苦和折磨，她不得不如此。不仅如此，她还觉得她现在的生活和幸福都归功于他。我不怪她把渚薰视为威胁，认为他会伤害真嗣。

I know the things Kaworu did were wrong but the difference is I've actually spoken to him and Rei hasn't. I've listened to him tell me about his upbringing and what he was made to believe under SEELE. Yes, Kaworu did bad things but we all did bad things back then and we're all paying for it now. I know that more than anyone else.  
我知道渚薰所做的事是错误的，但不同的是，我实际上和他交谈过，而绫波没有。我听他讲述了他的成长经历以及他在 Seele 下被迫相信的东西。是的，渚薰做了坏事，但我们那时都做了坏事，现在我们都在为此付出代价。我比任何人都清楚这一点。

I do feel like telling her this now was a mistake. She's probably had a rough ride dealing with her brother and it isn't exactly easy to hold this conversation with Kaworu sat in the other room but I feel she deserves to know. If I'm going to be Kaworu's friend then I need to tell her that and try to get her to give him a chance.  
我现在确实觉得告诉她这些是个错误。她可能一直在艰难地处理她哥哥的事情，而且当渚薰坐在另一个房间时，进行这样的对话并不容易，但我觉得她有权知道。如果我要成为渚薰的朋友，那么我需要告诉她这一点，并试图让她给他一个机会。

The truth is I need her to be my best friend through this too because I'm finding the more time I spend with him the more I'm starting to have other feelings too. It's only been two weeks since I've met him but being around him just… makes me smile, it makes me happy and I feel comfortable around him.  
事实是我也需要她在这段时间里成为我最好的朋友，因为我发现随着与他相处的时间增多，我开始产生其他感情了。自从遇见他才不过两周，但待在他身边……让我微笑，让我感到快乐，也让我觉得自在。

Also… I do find him attractive. His eyes show so much emotion and I feel like I could get lost staring into them. He has a cute little smile when he laughs and the look on his face when he played piano, the way his fingers glided across the piano keys was wonderful.  
而且……我确实觉得他很有魅力。他的眼睛流露出如此丰富的情感，我仿佛能迷失在那深邃的凝视中。他笑起来时那可爱的微笑，还有他弹钢琴时脸上的表情，手指在琴键上流畅滑动的样子，真是美妙极了。

I shake my head trying to stop those thoughts for a moment, I need to deal with the friendship thing first.  
我摇摇头，试图暂时停止这些思绪，我需要先处理好友谊这一层关系。

"Look Rei, I… I know you don't like him and I don't blame you. Those things you said about him though, about him not being trustworthy and him hurting others, him being away of what he was doing? He could have stopped at any time? Rei… Take away the part about him being an Angel and who does that sound like?"  
"看，丽，我……我知道你不喜欢他，我不怪你。但你说的那些关于他的话，说他不可信，伤害别人，明知故犯？他本可以随时停手的？丽……去掉他是天使的部分，这听起来像谁呢？"

I hear Rei sigh in annoyance, _"That is completely different Asuka, you were-"_  
我听到丽不耐烦地叹气，“那完全不同，明日香，你曾经——”

"I was a traumatized teen with a fucked up childhood. I had a father who couldn't give a shit about me and a step-mother who tried but I didn't want to know. I grew up believing I was better than everyone else and I was horrible to you all. I lashed out at everyone, it didn't matter who it was, you… Misato and yes… your brother most of all. I was a horrible person Rei. If people know the truth about me… what do you think they would say?"  
"我曾经是一个受过创伤的青少年，有着糟糕的童年。我有一个根本不在乎我的父亲和一个试图关心我却让我不想理会的继母。我从小认为自己高人一等，对你们都很恶劣。我向所有人发泄，不管对方是谁，你……美里，还有，尤其是你哥哥。我是个很糟糕的人，丽。如果人们知道我的真相……你觉得他们会说什么？"

She pauses again, _"I understand what you are saying yet I do not see how his situation mirrors yours. Besides you have already expressed guilt for your situation and we know why you acted in such a way. You have apologized for it."_  
她再次停顿，“我明白你的意思，但我看不出他的处境如何与你相似。况且，你已经为自己的行为表达了愧疚，我们知道你为何会那样做。你已经为此道歉了。”

"So has he Rei, he feels horrible about what he was and what he did, he apologized to me and to the people in the facility. I spoke to him, I found out about what sort of childhood he had, SEELE raised him just so that he could die. They kept him isolated from the outside world and told him nothing but how bad humans were."  
“丽，他也一样，他对自己曾经的样子和所做的事感到非常痛苦，他向我以及设施里的人们道了歉。我和他谈过，我了解到他有着怎样的童年，SEELE 培养他只是为了让他去死。他们让他与外界隔绝，只告诉他人类有多么恶劣。”

_"That is… unfortunate. I… was unaware of any of this, you have remained in contact with him then?"  
“那真是……不幸。我……对此一无所知，你一直和他保持联系吗？”_

"Yes… Rei… I spent the night at his apartment last night."  
"是的……丽……我昨晚在他公寓过夜了。"

_"You what? I did not think you were inte-"_ Her voice gets higher and I can only imagine what is running through her mind.  
"你说什么？我没想到你会……"她的声音越来越高，我只能想象她脑海中闪过的念头。"

"Not like that!" I hastily stop her, "I got a phonecall yesterday from Fuyutsuki… Kaworu had been attacked, the people who were supposed to protect him got him outside his apartment. I was Kaworu's only friend so I spent the night here and looked after him. He needed a friend Rei… But… I had to tell you because you deserve to know about him too."  
"不是那样的！"我急忙打断她，"昨天我从冬月那里接到电话……渚薰遭到了袭击，那些本该保护他的人却让他离开了公寓。我是渚薰唯一的朋友，所以我在这里过夜并照顾他。他需要一个朋友，丽……但是……我必须告诉你，因为你也应该了解他的情况。"

There is another long pause, _"Was he hurt badly?"_  
又是一阵漫长的沉默，“他伤得很重吗？”

"They bust his nose, gave him a black eye and kicked every other part of him. Nothing was broken but it didn't help his fear of people."  
“他们打断了他的鼻子，打青了他的眼睛，还踢遍了他全身。虽然没骨折，但这加剧了他对人的恐惧。”

_"I see. I am… Sorry for what has happened to him then, if he is as you say than he does not deserve that. I… I apologize that I cannot yet feel good about this situation, there are things I need to figure out."  
“我明白了。那么，对于他所遭遇的一切，我感到很抱歉。如果他真如你所说，那他确实不该遭受这些。我……我为我还不能对这种情况感到释怀而道歉，我需要弄清楚一些事情。”_

"I know." I reply, "I just… He seems like a victim too in this and he shouldn't be alone."  
"我知道。" 我回答，"我只是……在这件事中，他也像是受害者，他不应该独自一人。"

I hear what sounds like a small chuckle from the other end of the phone, _"This is proof then, that you are not the bad person that you think you are Asuka."_  
我听到电话那头传来一声轻微的轻笑，"这就是证明，你并不是你自己认为的那种坏人，明日香。"

I feel myself blush, "What the hell is that supposed to mean?"  
我感到自己脸红了，"那到底是什么意思？"

_"That you constantly berate yourself and tell me you are not a good person, yet you are looking after this person you have no reason to like or trust. You… saw past that which others such as myself cannot yet see past. You are a good person."  
"你总是自我批评，告诉我你不是个好人，然而你却在照顾一个你没有理由喜欢或信任的人。你……看到了那些像我这样的人还未能看透的东西。你是个好人。"_

"I'm just trying to help him."  
"我只是想帮他。"

_"I know and I apologize again that I cannot feel good about this but perhaps with more time and when I am certain he will not hurt anyone I may do so. I would like you to look after him though and Asuka…"  
"我知道，再次为我的不安道歉，但也许随着时间的推移，当我确信他不会伤害任何人时，我会感觉好些。不过，我希望你能继续照顾他，还有……明日香……"_

"Yes?" “是？”

_"If he does hurt you… I will be in Germany to hunt him down."  
"如果他真的伤害了你……我会去德国把他找出来。"_

I can't help but laugh but also feel slightly afraid that perhaps Rei isn't joking. Before I say my goodbye I realize there is something I want to say to Rei, "Rei… before I go I… I have no right to ask you to do this and no right to say his name but please… I know how much he must be hurting right now and he needs people so… Look after Shinji."  
我不禁笑出声来，但也有些害怕，或许丽并不是在开玩笑。在我告别之前，我意识到有些话想对丽说，“丽……在我离开之前……我没有权利要求你这么做，也没有权利提起他的名字，但请……我知道他现在一定很痛苦，他需要人陪伴……照顾好真嗣。”

### Chapter 6: Telephone Line  
第六章：电话线  

**6th September 2021 2021 年 9 月 6 日**

**Asuka Langley Soryu – Berlin  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷 – 柏林**

**Early morning. 清晨时分。**

I open the door into my apartment step straight through into the living room, on looking around I can see it's exactly the same as it was when I left it on Friday evening. The same dirty plates have been left out on the coffee table, one of my controllers has been left on the sofa along with my laptop, the entire place looks... lived in and yet as I push the laptop and controller aside it feels remarkably empty.  
我推开公寓的门，直接走进客厅，环顾四周，一切如旧，和我周五晚上离开时一模一样。咖啡桌上还散落着脏盘子，沙发上遗留着我的一个游戏手柄和笔记本电脑，整个地方看起来……充满了生活气息，然而当我把笔记本和手柄推到一旁时，却感到异常空荡。

There was actually a part of me that didn't want to come back to this place after the weekend. That small part of me wanted to stay at Kaworu's place but I had work to do here. Besides which Kaworu also had to return to work, Fuyutsuki did offer him the week off due to the attack but Kaworu insisted on going back in. I can't say I blame him for that, I'd have been the same.  
实际上，有一部分的我并不想在周末后回到这个地方。那小小的一部分我渴望留在渚薰那里，但我在这里还有工作要做。况且，渚薰也得回去上班，尽管冬月教授因袭击事件给了他一周假期，渚薰却坚持要回去。我不能说他这样做有什么错，换作我也会一样。

I suppose I'll at least be thankful for being back in my own bed tonight. Kaworu's sofa was comfortable but I don't think I'd be able to handle too many nights on it. I suppose there is always his... No, I can't think that sort of thing. I mustn't think that, I can't let myself think of feel those sorts of things.  
我想今晚至少能感激自己回到了自己的床上。Kaworu 的沙发虽然舒适，但我觉得自己无法承受太多夜晚睡在上面。我想总有他的...不，我不能那样想。我绝不能那样想，我不能让自己想到或感受到那些事情。

That is another reason as to why I had to return. Over the course of yesterday and even this morning I've been having slightly more thoughts about Kaworu in certain ways. I had to get away from there because I can't allow myself to feel those things for him, befriending him was an accident but I can't let that go too far. He'll just end up being hurt.  
这也是我必须回来的另一个原因。昨天一整天甚至到今天早上，我对 Kaworu 的某些想法变得稍微多了一些。我必须离开那里，因为我不能让自己对他产生那种感情，与他成为朋友是个意外，但我不能让这走得太远。他最终只会受到伤害。

Yet, every time I try to remind myself of that the thoughts become more intrusive and vivid. They start off innocent enough. We might be sitting on the sofa and playing a game together but then we'll be holding hands or holding one another. Strangely it always seems to be Kaworu who is cuddling into me and not the other way around, I suppose even in my fantasies I have to be the dominant one.  
然而，每次我试图提醒自己这一点时，这些想法变得更加侵入性和生动。它们开始时足够无辜。我们可能坐在沙发上一起玩游戏，但随后我们会牵手或拥抱彼此。奇怪的是，似乎总是 Kaworu 依偎在我身边，而不是相反，我想即使在幻想中，我也必须是主导的那一个。

Today those thoughts shifted again. We weren't holding each other on the sofa but in his bed. We weren't just cuddling but we were kissing as well, passionately and deeply. I could feel him, I could feel all of him. It made my bus ride home very uncomfortable.  
今天，这些想法再次转变。我们不再是在沙发上相拥，而是在他的床上。我们不仅仅是依偎，还在深情而热烈地亲吻。我能感受到他，感受到他的全部。这让我的回家路程变得非常尴尬。

I keep on trying to tell myself that it means absolutely nothing, my mind is just working overtime because of the strange situation I find myself in. It's affect anyone if an attractive stranger like Kaworu suddenly came into your life in such a way. Here is this person who I know nothing about yet shares a history with me and my past. He enjoys and can play the music I also like, he is well spoken and very handsome. Yet he also needs help and is similar to me in many ways, of course that is going to affect me.  
我不断试图告诉自己，这根本不代表什么，只是因为身处这种奇怪的境地，我的大脑才过度运转。如果像渚薰这样的迷人陌生人突然以这种方式进入你的生活，任何人都会受到影响。这个人，我对他一无所知，却与我共享一段历史和过去。他喜欢并能演奏我也喜欢的音乐，他谈吐得体，非常英俊。然而，他也需要帮助，在很多方面与我相似，当然这会影响到我。

The time we spent together has hardly been normal either. Who would blame me for the first meeting? I was curious and wanted to know more about him. I wanted to know how someone could have upset Rei so much and why he was scared of me. This weekend I was just being a good friend. He had been hurt by the people who promised to protect him, how could I not be there for him. So, all in all my mind acting the way it does makes sense.  
我们在一起度过的时光也几乎不正常。谁会怪我第一次见面呢？我那时好奇，想更多地了解他。我想知道是什么样的人能让丽如此不安，又为何对我感到害怕。这个周末我只是想做个好朋友。他曾被那些承诺保护他的人伤害过，我怎能不在他身边。所以，总的来说，我的思维方式是有道理的。

Besides I barely know the guy, I can't have any feelings for someone I barely know. He doesn't even know me yet, if he did then he would have continued to run from me. If he knew me then he'd know that I can't offer him anything good friendship or otherwise, all I can offer is myself, and I'm not worth anything.  
再说了，我几乎不了解这个人，我不可能对一个几乎不认识的人有感情。他甚至还不了解我，如果他了解我，他就会继续逃避我。如果他了解我，他就会知道我无法给他任何除了友谊之外的好处，我能提供的只有我自己，而我一文不值。

The dream I had last night hasn't helped either. It involved Kaworu and Shinji again. It was not the same as the first one, I didn't witness them together without me but instead I was with the two of them. It was early morning I think and we were all lying in a bed together. I had one on either side of me and we were all so warm and happy. It was strange but it felt like the three of us were pieces that completed some bizarre puzzle.  
昨晚的梦也没有帮助。梦里又出现了薰和真嗣。和第一个梦不一样，我没有目睹他们在一起而我在场外，而是我和他们两人在一起。我想是清晨时分，我们三个人躺在一张床上。我两边各有一个，我们都很温暖和快乐。这很奇怪，但感觉我们三个像是完成了某个奇怪拼图的碎片。

It's been a very long time since I've thought of Shinji in such a way. I never stopped having feelings for him after I left Japan but I tried to suppress them. It's why I went so long without uttering his name. That's changed now, I said his name to Rei and the floodgates are now open once again. Shinji... Shinji... Shinji, Shinji, Shinji... Stupid idiot Shinji!  
已经很久没有以这种方式想起过真嗣了。自从离开日本后，我对他的感情从未停止，但我试图压抑它们。这就是为什么我这么久没有提起他的名字。现在情况变了，我对绫波提到了他的名字，那些情感的闸门再次被打开。真嗣...真嗣...真嗣，真嗣，真嗣...愚蠢的真嗣！

I can't help the sad smile that comes to my lips as my mind wanders to the image of Shinji. Rei has told him that Kaworu is alive now, I imagine he'll have taken the news about it hard. Rei will take care of him though. Rei knows what to do, she's come a hell of a long way from the girl she used to be. The girl that I berated and called a doll.  
我不禁露出一丝苦笑，思绪飘向真嗣的影像。绫波已经告诉他薰还活着的消息，我想他听到这个消息会很难过。不过绫波会照顾他的。绫波知道该怎么做，她已经从一个我曾斥责并称之为玩偶的女孩走了很远。

I wonder what they're doing right now, I wonder what he is doing right now. Rei mentioned he is playing the cello again, I wonder if he is playing that now? I wonder what he sounds like on it. When I heard him many years ago I really liked what I heard, I know little of how to play an instrument, it's the one thing my brilliant self never got around to trying. I was focused on my studies and my Eva piloting, maybe I should take up an instrument one day.  
我不知道他们现在在做什么，我不知道他现在在做什么。绫波提到他又开始拉大提琴了，我不知道他现在是不是在拉？我想知道他在大提琴上的声音是什么样的。多年前我听过他的演奏，我真的很喜欢，我对乐器演奏知之甚少，这是我聪明绝顶的自己从未尝试过的事情。我专注于我的学习和 Eva 驾驶，也许有一天我应该学一门乐器。

I'd like to hear Shinji play. I should ask Rei to record him playing for me so I can hear it. I know she'll disapprove of it or… maybe I should just reach out to him myself. Maybe I should just let him know I'm alive and well. I know I have to do it eventually, I can't let Rei keep that secret forever but I don't know if I'm ready.  
我想听听真嗣的演奏。我应该让绫波帮我录下他弹琴的样子，这样我就能听到了。我知道她会反对，或者……也许我应该直接联系他。也许我应该让他知道我还活着，而且很好。我知道我迟早得这么做，我不能让绫波永远保守这个秘密，但我不知道自己是否准备好了。

No… It's not that I'm not ready, it's that I'm scared. Scared of hurting him again but so damn scared of being hurt. Scared that he'll have smartened up and seen who I really was. He'll tell me the truth about myself. Tell me that I'm a horrible person and that he hates me. Tell me how much I hurt him and that he doesn't want any part of me in his life.  
不……不是我没准备好，而是我害怕。害怕再次伤害他，但也害怕被伤害。害怕他已经变得聪明，看清了我的真面目。他会告诉我关于我自己的真相。告诉我我是个可怕的人，他恨我。告诉我我伤他有多深，他不想再和我有任何瓜葛。

Or maybe that wouldn't happen. Maybe it's just like Rei says and I'm not as horrible a person as I think I am. Maybe I can actually be friends with Shinji and Kaworu and not have to feel this goddamn guilt so much. This is why I didn't want to be alone, because with Kaworu I could actually forget about it. I could make him my focus and I didn't have to remember me for a change.  
或者也许那不会发生。也许就像绫波说的，我并没有自己想象的那么糟糕。也许我真的能和真嗣、渚薰成为朋友，不再那么强烈地感到内疚。这就是为什么我不想独自一人，因为和渚薰在一起，我才能真正忘记这些。我可以让他成为我的焦点，不用再一直想着自己。

I can't keep doing that though can I? I can't just use Kaworu to prop myself up. Next time we meet there won't be anything else behind it, no curiosity and no attack from others. It'll be on our own terms but I don't know if I can reach out to him. I'd like to see him again, I like being around him. I like talking to him about music and hearing what his plans are. We can play games together and just laugh and enjoy ourselves.  
我不能再这样下去了，对吧？我不能总是依赖渚薰来支撑自己。下次我们见面时，背后不会再有任何其他东西，没有好奇心，也没有他人的攻击。一切都将由我们自己决定，但我不知道我是否能向他伸出手。我想再见他一面，我喜欢和他在一起的感觉。我喜欢和他谈论音乐，听他的计划。我们可以一起玩游戏，尽情欢笑，享受彼此的陪伴。

I'd like to continue being friends with him, I want to be friends with him. I want to be friends with Shinji again. Maybe we could all meet up together and get everything out. We can all scream and yell and cry at one another until we have nothing left. Maybe we could even… I shake my head, my minds wandered to that place again. I don't know why I'm feeling so wound up, I'm not normally… I mean I do imagine things but I never usually feel like this. Then again I haven't in a while, maybe I need to take care of it. I need a bath… a nice long hot bath to empty my mind of these thoughts.  
我想继续和他做朋友，我想和他成为朋友。我也想再次和真嗣成为朋友。也许我们可以一起聚聚，把所有事情都说开。我们可以互相尖叫、大喊、哭泣，直到再也没有什么可说的。也许我们甚至可以……我摇了摇头，思绪又飘到了那个地方。我不知道为什么我会感到如此紧张，我平时不是这样的……我是说，我确实会想象一些事情，但我通常不会像这样。不过，我已经有一段时间没有这样了，也许我需要处理一下。我需要泡个澡……一个舒适的热水澡，让这些思绪从我的脑海中消失。

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**  
**Tokyo-2 第二东京**

I approach the store and take a deep breath to calm my nerves, I can already hear the voice inside my head telling me how silly it is to be nervous about this.  
我走向商店，深吸一口气以平复紧张的情绪，脑海中已经响起那个声音，嘲笑我为这点小事紧张有多傻。

_'What are you? Stupid. They don't know who you are, they've never heard of you! Why are you scared of them? Just go in there and get it done!'  
“你这是怎么了？傻了吗。他们根本不认识你，也没听说过你！你怕他们什么？直接进去，把事情办了！”_

I nearly laugh and shake my head, it's funny how the voice in my head who tries to push me to do something will take her form. I know it's right as well, I know I have nothing to fear by going into the store. I grab a basket and pull out my list. I move into the store and try to ignore the feeling that the people are looking at me, that they know who I am and are going to say something to me.  
我差点笑出声来，摇了摇头，真有趣，那个总试图推动我去做些什么的内心声音，竟然会以她的形象出现。我也知道她说得对，我知道进店没什么好怕的。我拿起一个篮子，掏出清单。走进店里，努力忽略那种感觉——人们都在盯着我，他们知道我是谁，随时会对我评头论足。

I brush past them and move to get the first items on my list. I move into the vegetable aisle and start looking at the ones I need. I take my time examining each one trying to find the ones that are the best quality. When I'm satisfied with them I place them into the basket. I look down at the next thing I need when I hear a familiar voice calling out my name.  
我擦身而过，走向清单上的第一项物品。我走进蔬菜区，开始寻找我需要的那些。我仔细检查每一个，试图找到品质最好的。当我满意后，便将它们放入篮子。我低头看向下一项需要的东西，这时听到一个熟悉的声音在呼唤我的名字。

"Hey Shinji!" “嘿，真嗣！”

My first instinct is to panic but instead I look up to see a smiling Hikari waving at me. I smile and wave back and move towards her, "Hikari!"  
我的第一反应是慌张，但我抬头看到微笑着向我挥手的光，我也笑了，挥手回应，“光！”

She bows her head politely towards me, "How are you doing?"  
她礼貌地向我低头致意，“你好吗？”

"I'm going well." I reply to her as I pull a box of eggs down from the shelf. I open the lid to check the contents for any damage before setting them into the basket, "Are you and Touji okay?"  
“我很好。”我一边回答她，一边从架子上取下一盒鸡蛋。我打开盖子检查内容物是否有损坏，然后才将其放入篮中，“你和东治还好吗？”

She nods, "Fine, Toji has a coaching session today. Don't tell him I told you this but I reckon he was a bit nervous about it."  
她点点头，“很好，东治今天有个教练课。别告诉他我跟你说了这个，但我觉得他有点紧张。”

"Oh really! That's great!" I smile as she tells me the news, Toji since returning has been working towards becoming a PE teacher. It's quite a turnaround for someone like Toji who never really shown any interest in school but he really wants to do it.  
"哦，真的！那太好了！" 她告诉我这个消息时，我笑着说。东治自从回来后一直在努力成为一名体育老师。对于像东治这样从未真正对学校表现出兴趣的人来说，这真是一个巨大的转变，但他真的很想这么做。

"It is, I heard you're taking cello lessons too!"  
"确实，我听说你也在上大提琴课！"

I nod, "Y-Yeah! I have another lesson this afternoon actually."  
我点头，"嗯，是的！实际上今天下午我还有一节课。"

I feel myself tense up when I remember my lesson this afternoon. Today is the day that I was going to give me answer about joining up with the group. I still don't know what I'm going to do. With all that has happened I never got a chance to discuss it with Rei and then the news about Kaworu pushed it out of my mind. Damnit, I'm such an idiot!  
每当回想起今天下午的课程，我就感到自己紧张起来。今天是我要给出是否加入团队的答复的日子。我仍然不知道该怎么做。发生了这么多事，我从未有机会和丽讨论过，然后关于薰的消息又让我把这事抛诸脑后。该死，我真是个白痴！

Hikari seems to notice my sudden discomfort, "Is everything okay?"  
光似乎注意到了我的突然不适，“一切都好吗？”

"Y-Yeah I just… I forgot that I was supposed to do something today and I still don't know if I can do it." I reply.  
“嗯——嗯，我只是……我忘了今天我应该做某件事，而且我仍然不确定我能否做到。”我回答道。

"Is this about that group thing?"  
"这是关于那个小组活动的事吗？"

I nod, "Y-You knew about that?"  
我点头，"Y-你已经知道了吗？"

"Toji told me about it when he said you were taking lessons. So you haven't made a decision on it yet?"  
"东治告诉我这件事的时候，他说你在上课程。那么你还没决定要不要参加吗？"

I shake my head, "No… Not yet, I don't know what I should do."  
我摇摇头，“不……还没有，我不知道我该做什么。”

"Well, have you talked to other people?"  
“那么，你和其他人谈过了吗？”

"I spoke to Misato and Rei briefly… I spoke to Toji and Kensuke and…"  
“我和美里、绫波简短地谈过……我和真治、健介也谈过……”

"They just told you to do what you wanted to do right?"  
"他们只是让你做你想做的事，对吧？"

I nod, "Yeah… Problem is I don't know what I want to do. I just don't want to let people down I suppose."  
我点点头，"是啊……问题是，我不知道自己想做什么。我想，我只是不想让人失望。"

"I don't think there is any danger of you doing that but… I can see how people just saying do what you want won't help." She says as she smiles at me, "Do you like the idea of playing cello with others?"  
"我觉得你不会让人失望的，不过……我明白别人说‘做你想做的’这种话帮不上忙。"" 她笑着对我说，""你喜欢和其他人一起拉大提琴的想法吗？"

I pause for a moment to think about it, the idea does appear to me. I enjoy playing the cello, I like it a lot and I can really lose myself in playing whatever music I've selected be it someone else's or just improvisation. I guess it would be fun to play with others and have a conductor or even compose our own pieces. I just don't know if I'm ready for that.  
我停顿了一下，思考着这个想法，它确实浮现在我脑海中。我喜欢拉大提琴，非常喜欢，而且我可以完全沉浸在演奏中，无论是别人的曲子还是即兴创作。我想和别人一起演奏，有指挥甚至创作我们自己的作品，应该会很有趣。我只是不确定自己是否准备好了。

"I… I guess, I've never really done it before. When I first started it was just me and my tutor. My school didn't have a music department and in Tokyo-3… I never really had the time. I just… I don't know if I can, it's hard enough for me to be here."  
“我……我想，我以前从未真正这样做过。当我刚开始学习时，只有我和我的导师。我的学校没有音乐系，在第三新东京市……我从来没有真正有时间。我只是……我不知道我是否能做到，对我来说，光是站在这里就已经很困难了。”

"But you are here aren't you?"  
“但你不是已经在这里了吗？”

"I… I guess…" "我…我想…"

"And how do you feel about it?"  
"那你对此感觉如何？"

"Well… A little bit scared." I admit, "I just need to get used to it though, I know that."  
"嗯…有点害怕。" 我承认道，"不过我需要适应一下，我知道这一点。"

"It's the same with that then. The people in here, they don't know you just like the people in that group won't. They'll just see Shinji Ikari the cello player and a new member to their group. If the idea of playing in a group appeals to you then try it Shinji, push yourself and if you don't like it then you can always leave but if you don't try it then you'll regret not trying."  
"那么，情况是一样的。这里的人，他们并不了解你，就像那个团体的人也不会了解你一样。他们只会看到弹奏大提琴的碇真嗣，以及他们团体的新成员。如果加入一个团体的想法吸引你，那就试试吧，碇真嗣，逼自己一把，如果你不喜欢，随时可以离开，但如果你不尝试，你会后悔没有尝试的。"

I let out a laugh and shake my head, "I know… I've been trying to tell myself that and I've been hoping someone will say it to me. Rei and Misato they…"  
我笑出声来，摇了摇头，"我知道……我一直试图这样告诉自己，也一直希望有人能对我说这句话。绫波和美里她们……"

"Rei and Misato love you a lot Shinji, we all do but they have their own issues and I think they're afraid of giving you a nudge sometimes." Hikari explains, "You should do this, you said you've thought about it and the idea appeals to you. The only thing holding you back is your fear of the people there and just coming to the store that'll get easier over time."  
"绫波和美里非常爱你，碇真嗣，我们大家都爱你，但她们有自己的问题，我想有时候她们害怕推你一把。"光解释道，"你应该这么做，你说你考虑过，这个想法吸引你。唯一阻碍你的就是你对那里人的恐惧，只要来店里，随着时间推移，这会变得容易。"

I realize that Hikari is right, my fear of people is what is holding me back. The more I think about it the more I realize what I'm scared of is people recognizing me and what I was. I'm not scared of playing cello in front of people. I want to do that, I like the idea of doing that so I'm going to do it.  
我意识到光是对的，我对人的恐惧正是阻碍我的原因。我越是思考，就越明白我害怕的是人们认出我，以及我曾经的身份。我并不害怕在人们面前拉大提琴。我想那样做，我喜欢那个想法，所以我打算去做。

"You're right. Thank you Hikari."  
“你说得对。谢谢你，光。”

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

That was a mistake. That was a goddamn stupid mistake and I hate myself for it so much. Why did I even think I could do this? Did I seriously think I could just jump in here and get myself off like it was normal? Did I really think I could just lie back and think of those two without any problems? Of course not, I'm Asuka Langley Soryu, I can't even do that without messing it up.  
那是个错误。真他妈愚蠢的错误，我为此恨透了自己。我怎么会以为自己能做得到呢？我真的以为自己可以就这样跳进来，像平常一样解脱吗？我真的以为我可以躺下，想着那两个人而没有任何问题吗？当然不可能，我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，我连那点小事都搞砸了。

It started off fine, the water was nice and warm and... well that started to feel good at first but then of course I had to start feeling the guilt. What the hell was I doing using their image to get myself off? I have no right to use their image for anything like that, most of all making myself feel good.  
一开始还好，水温暖舒适，嗯...起初感觉还不错，但随后当然就开始感到内疚了。我到底在干什么，利用他们的形象来满足自己？我没有权利用他们的形象做这种事，尤其是让自己感觉良好。

Then things got worse, I started to remember what I have done to Shinji in the past. I started to think about what Kaworu would say if he knew how horrible a person I was. Soon afterwards all the good feelings I had, the release that I craved had died away. It had been replaced only with a feeling of repulsion at myself and a desire to get out of there.  
然后情况变得更糟，我开始回想起过去对真嗣所做的一切。我开始想象如果薰知道我是多么糟糕的人，他会说什么。不久之后，我所有的美好感觉，我所渴望的解脱都消失了。取而代之的是对自己的厌恶感和想要逃离那里的冲动。

I glance at myself in self in the mirror for a moment. The scars on my body seem to be showing more prominently today. Two marks on my chest from where my Eva was impaled and the damage transferred to me. Strangely enough there was little scaring on my face, only what I see in nightmares. I quickly put my bra on and throw a shirt on over me to cover myself up.  
我瞥了一眼镜中的自己。今天身上的伤疤似乎更加显眼了。胸前有两处痕迹，是我驾驶的 Eva 被刺穿时造成的伤害转移到我身上的。奇怪的是，我的脸上几乎没有留下疤痕，只有我在噩梦中看到的那些。我迅速穿上胸罩，套上一件衬衫遮住自己。

I don't even glance back at the bath as I move into the front room, what a stupid idea. I should have known it wouldn't go well from the start. I never took well to baths, I've always taken showers but I thought lying back and indulging myself would be easier in the bath. I can't even remember the last time I took a bath properly. It must have been...  
我甚至没有回头看一眼浴室，就走进了前厅，这主意真是蠢透了。我早该知道从一开始就不会顺利。我向来不喜欢泡澡，一直习惯淋浴，但我想着躺在浴缸里放纵自己可能会更容易些。我甚至记不清上次好好泡澡是什么时候了。那一定是……

I try to cast my mind back and another unwanted image flashes into my mind. A delapidated house on the outskirts of a town, clothes folded up and left on a chair and a rusty bathtub with a naked shivering girl in it.  
我试图回想起过去，脑海中却闪现出一个不受欢迎的画面。一个破败的房子，位于小镇的边缘，衣服叠好放在椅子上，还有一个生锈的浴缸，里面是一个赤裸颤抖的女孩。

That was the last time I took a 'bath.' I feel sick.  
那就是我最后一次‘泡澡’。我感觉恶心。

I leave the bathroom behind and move into the front room throwing myself onto the couch. I quickly check my phone, I've had a message from Kaworu letting me know he is alright. I send him a quick message to let him know I'm home and working on the book.  
我离开浴室，走进客厅，把自己扔到沙发上。我迅速查看手机，收到了一封来自渚的消息，告诉我他一切安好。我快速回复他，告诉他我已经到家，正在处理那本书。

I open my laptop but any desire to do work has been flushed out of me along with any other desire. I feel nothing but emptiness and anger at myself. I don't even feel clean right now, I just feel dirty and wrong. I slam the laptop lid shut in frustration. This isn't fair damnit, I was happy earlier!  
我打开笔记本电脑，但任何工作的欲望都已被冲刷殆尽，连同其他所有欲望一起。我只感到空虚和对自己的愤怒。我现在甚至感觉不到干净，只觉得肮脏和不对劲。我气愤地合上笔记本电脑盖。这不公平，该死，我之前明明很开心的！

**13th September 2021 2021 年 9 月 13 日**

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**

**Tokyo-2 东京-2**

I can feel the exhaustion as I open the door to the apartment and immediately set my cello case down on the ground. I give my sore arms and hands a little bit of time to recover from carrying the heavy instrument around before kicking my shoes off and announcing I'm home to the empty apartment. I pick up the case again and bring it through into the living room.  
我打开公寓的门，立刻将大提琴盒放在地上，能感受到自己的疲惫。我给酸痛的手臂和双手一点时间恢复，它们刚承受了重物的负担，然后踢掉鞋子，向空荡荡的公寓宣告我回来了。我再次提起琴盒，带进客厅。

As I sit down on the sofa I feel something else within me besides the tiredness. It's a feeling I'm so unused to feeling, pride. I was actually able to do it, I was able to go out and meet with that group and not run away. For the past week that is what I've been telling myself would happen. For the past week I've been terrified of meeting them to the point that I even contemplated calling ahead this morning and saying I wouldn't be able to make it in.  
当我坐在沙发上时，除了疲惫之外，我感受到了另一种情绪。这是一种我极少体验到的情感——自豪。我竟然做到了，我能够走出去，与那个团体见面，而没有逃跑。过去一周里，我一直告诉自己会发生这种情况。过去一周，我害怕与他们会面到了今天早上甚至考虑提前打电话说我无法到场的地步。

I could run away from it though. I couldn't run away because I actually wanted to do it. I wanted to be there, ahead of tonight I was even having dreams about it. It seems so silly but I was dreaming that I was up on stage with other people. I was playing music with them and I was enjoying it so much. Hikari was right, the only thing holding me back was my fear of others, I did want to be there.  
我可以逃避它，但我没有逃避，因为我真的想去做。我想在那里，今晚之前我甚至梦到过它。这听起来很傻，但我梦见自己和其他人一起站在舞台上。我和他们一起演奏音乐，我非常享受。光是对的，唯一阻碍我的是我对别人的恐惧，我确实想在那里。

Even being there wasn't easy for me though. At first, I was barely able to speak, I was afraid to open my mouth for fear that I'd be sick. Our first task was to introduce ourselves and tell the others a little bit about ourselves. I managed to mumble out my name and tell them that I originally started playing cello over ten years ago but I hadn't played it much in the last five years.  
即使在那里对我来说也不容易。起初，我几乎说不出话来，我害怕张嘴，生怕会吐出来。我们的第一个任务是自我介绍，并向其他人简单介绍一下自己。我勉强咕哝出我的名字，告诉他们我最初十多年前开始拉大提琴，但过去五年里没怎么拉过。

The others started to introduce themselves afterwards. There was one moment of fear for me when one of the violin players in the group introduced themselves. They had lived in Tokyo-3 and had always played violin but started taking it more seriously after the Third Impact. Their dream was to compose and perform a piece dedicated to their son who had died during one of the Angel attacks.  
其他人随后开始自我介绍。当小组中的一个 violin 手自我介绍时，我有一瞬间的恐惧。他们曾在东京-3 生活，一直拉小提琴，但在第三次冲击后开始更认真地对待它。他们的梦想是创作并演奏一首献给他们死于天使袭击中的儿子的作品。

From there the other members of the group introduced themselves on by one. There were about twelve of us in total. Two cellists, six violin players and four viola players. The youngest was a girl who played the violin, she seemed to be a year or two younger than I am, the older was a man in his early fifties.  
从那儿开始，小组的其他成员一个接一个地自我介绍。我们总共有大约十二个人。两位大提琴手，六位小提琴手和四位中提琴手。最年轻的是一位拉小提琴的女孩，她似乎比我小一两岁，年纪最大的是一位五十岁出头的男士。

After our brief introductions we were each asked to play a piece that we enjoyed or that meant something. I selected the Cello Suit No. 1 by Bach, it's a piece I play fairly often and feel I'm competent at. It was the first piece I pushed myself to try and learn on my own without a tutor asking me to and it is one I return to frequently. I typically see it as a piece I enjoy but it is also a piece that has some strange memories associated with it, it was the one I played on the night of a particular incident.  
简短的自我介绍后，我们被要求各自演奏一首我们喜欢或具有特殊意义的曲子。我选择了巴赫的《大提琴组曲第 1 号》，这是我经常演奏且自认为比较熟练的曲子。这是我第一次在没有导师要求的情况下，自己努力去学习的曲子，也是我经常回归练习的曲目。通常我把它视为一首我喜欢的作品，但它也与一些奇怪的记忆有关联，那是我在一个特定夜晚演奏的曲子。

After we each played a solo piece my tutor spoke to the group about what he would like to do with the group and plans for the future. He mentioned that he had a particular piece in mind that he would like to try to get us to learn for a performance later this year. For now, he would like to focus on getting us in sync with one another so will be running through some simple pieces next week.  
在我们各自演奏了一段独奏后，我的导师向大家讲述了关于小组未来的计划和他希望我们学习的特定曲目，以便在今年晚些时候的演出中呈现。目前，他希望专注于让我们彼此同步，因此下周将练习一些简单的曲目。

After that the session was over and I returned home. I am exhausted but happy. I was so scared throughout the session that at any one moment one of them might recognize me. I was terrified on the way home that the same might happen but neither of those things happened. Perhaps I shouldn't fear that happening anymore, maybe if I do keep on pushing myself as I am doing I can get through this.  
之后，会议结束了，我回到家。虽然疲惫但心情愉快。整个会议期间我都非常害怕，担心他们中的任何一个会认出我。回家的路上同样提心吊胆，但这些都没有发生。也许我不再需要害怕这种情况了，如果我能继续像现在这样推动自己，或许我能度过这个难关。

I reach for the remote control for the television when I hear a noise coming from the other side of the room. I look over and see a phone sat on one of the drawer units and let out a sigh. I bet Misato has left her phone here again, she's done that a few times lately. It's a good thing that we're watched twenty-four seven because if there was an emergency getting in contact with her would be a nightmare.  
当我听到房间另一侧传来声响时，我伸手去拿电视遥控器。我转头一看，发现抽屉柜上放着一部手机，便叹了口气。我敢打赌是 Misato 又把她的手机落在这里了，她最近已经好几次这样了。幸好我们全天候被监视，因为如果有紧急情况需要联系她，那将是一场噩梦。

I stand up and grab the phone from the cabinet. Much to my surprise it isn't actually Misato's phone but it's Rei's. I look at the number on screen, Private Number, I contemplate letting it go to voice mail but wonder if maybe it's important. If it is I should at least take a message for Rei, I tap the button to answer, "Hello?"  
我站起身，从柜子里抓起电话。出乎意料的是，这并非美里小姐的手机，而是绫波的。我看着屏幕上的号码，显示为“私人号码”，我犹豫是否让它转到语音信箱，但又担心可能有什么重要的事。如果是的话，我至少应该帮绫波记下留言，于是我按下接听键，“喂？”

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

**Berlin – Early Morning 柏林 – 清晨时分**

The mouse cursor hovers over the sent button as I glance back up at the e-mail I've composed. I check the address bar and see his e-mail address wrote there. It is the same one that Rei gave me 'just in case.' I didn't think that I would ever need it, I'm still not completely sure I do now. What I've done was born out of a sudden urge.  
鼠标光标悬停在发送按钮上，我再次瞥了一眼已写好的电子邮件。我检查了地址栏，看到那里写着他的电子邮件地址。正是绫波之前给我的那个‘以防万一’的地址。我从未想过会真的用到它，现在也仍不完全确定是否真的需要。我所做的一切，都是出于一时的冲动。

For the past five years I've been able to avoid having any contact with him whatsoever. It seemed so easy to do as well. I just tried to avoid thinking about him where I could, even to the point where I couldn't even bring myself to utter his name. Recently it's become much harder to not think of him or say his name.  
过去五年里，我成功避免了与他有任何接触。这似乎也并不难做到。我只是尽量不去想他，甚至到了连他的名字都无法说出口的地步。但最近，不去想他或说出他的名字变得越来越困难。

Shinji Ikari, the boy that I ran away from so many years ago. What are you like now Shinji? What do you look like and what do you sound like? Who are you now? Are you still meek and afraid like I knew you to be? Are you still kind and protective like I know you be? Do you still hate yourself like I hate myself? Do you still think about me like I think about you? Do you even still like me?  
碇真嗣，那个多年前我逃离的男孩。现在的你是什么样子呢，真嗣？你看起来如何，声音又是怎样的？现在的你是谁？你还是像我记忆中那样温顺而胆怯吗？你还是像我所知的那样善良且保护欲强吗？你还是像我一样讨厌自己吗？你还会像我想念你那样想念我吗？你甚至还会喜欢我吗？

Shinji is of course not the only guy who has been occupying my thoughts as of late. Kaworu is a mainstay in both my thoughts and my dreams. I've been having more dreams of him and Shinji, the three of us together in different situations. It seems so stupid to dream of something like that. Yet something feels so right about it.  
当然，最近占据我思绪的不仅仅是真嗣一个人。渚薰在我脑海和梦中也是常客。我最近梦到他和真嗣的次数越来越多，我们三个人在不同的情境下在一起。梦见这样的事情似乎很愚蠢。然而，不知为何，这感觉又如此正确。

I wonder about what Shinji's life has been like since I left. I wonder if he has had a girlfriend or even a boyfriend in all that time. Rei mentioned he seemed to like Kaworu and wondered if maybe he liked him romantically. I wonder if maybe Shinji's love life has been similar to mine. He deserves someone good to love him.  
我想知道自从我离开后，真嗣的生活是怎样的。我想知道他是否在这段时间里有过女朋友，甚至是男朋友。绫波提到他似乎喜欢渚薰，并猜测他是否对他有浪漫的情感。我想知道真嗣的恋爱生活是否和我相似。他值得一个好人来爱他。

I on the other hand tried to keep myself distant. My one sexual encounter was a one-night stand after getting drunk. I didn't regret it, it felt good enough but I wasn't exactly after anything longer than that. Any urges I have I'm fairly capable of handling myself. At least I was, after my last attempt when I thought of both of them I just find myself disgusted by the idea. How dare I use the image of two nice people to satisfy my own urges?  
而我则试图保持距离。我的唯一一次性经历是在醉酒后的短暂一夜情。我不后悔，感觉还不错，但我并没有追求更长久的关系。任何冲动我都能很好地自我控制。至少以前是这样，自从上次我想到他们俩时，我发现自己对这个想法感到厌恶。我怎么敢利用两个好人的形象来满足自己的欲望？

It seems so stupid, that's just what we do as people. I wouldn't exactly be offended if Kaworu had thought of me like that. It's just what happens, it's not like I've had a problem with thinking of people in the past. Then again, I'm still waiting for Kaworu to realize what a horrible person I really am.  
这看起来很愚蠢，这就是我们作为人的行为。如果渚曾经那样想过我，我也不会特别介意。事情就是这样发生的，我过去也没有对想到别人有什么问题。不过，我还是在等待渚意识到我其实是个多么糟糕的人。

I've been thinking recently that maybe I should just cut off contact with him. It'd be cruel but better for him in the long run to be rid of me. I haven't been able to do that though. I've not been messaging him first but I've been replying to the few messages he sends me and keeping up any conversation.  
最近我一直在想，也许我应该和他断绝联系。虽然这很残忍，但从长远来看，对他来说摆脱我是更好的选择。但我还没能做到这一点。我没有主动给他发消息，但我回复了他发来的几条消息，并维持着任何对话。

I do want to see Kaworu again, I want to hang out with him again. I really enjoyed the past two times but I don't have anything pushing me to do it this time. I've not got my curiosity to send me over there and I've not been summoned by an emergency. The next time I see him it'll be because I'm invited or I invite myself over and it'll just be me, Asuka Langley Soryu, the mess of a person. I can't put Kaworu through that.  
我确实想再见真嗣一次，想再次和他出去玩。过去的两次我真的很享受，但这次没有什么推动我这么做。我没有好奇心驱使我过去，也没有紧急召唤。下次我见到他，要么是我被邀请，要么是我主动去找他，而那时的我，只是那个一团糟的人——惣流·明日香·兰格雷。我不能让真嗣经历这些。

Maybe I'll have an excuse tonight though if I'm able to do this. I feel like I need something or someone to distract me from it and maybe talking to him would help. At the same time, I wonder if it really would in this case. I know what Kaworu's feelings are when it comes to the subject of Shinji. He's terrified of Shinji and I can understand that. After all that happened between the two of them perhaps Kaworu has more reason to be afraid of Shinji than I do. Maybe I should have spoken to Kaworu about doing this first.  
也许今晚我能找到借口，如果我能做到这件事的话。我感觉我需要什么或某人来分散我的注意力，也许和他聊聊会有所帮助。同时，我又怀疑在这种情况下是否真的有用。我知道真嗣在涉及绫波的话题时的感受。他对绫波感到恐惧，我能理解。毕竟他们之间发生了那么多事，或许真嗣比我有更多理由害怕绫波。也许我应该先和真嗣谈谈这件事。

No, it isn't Kaworu I should have spoken to first, it's Rei. I should tell her about me doing this and let her prepare for the reaction. I should tell her that I'm about to release her from her burden of keeping that secret. I should let her know that she no longer has to worry about keeping our friendship secret.  
不，我首先应该谈的不是渚薰，而是绫波。我应该告诉她我正在做这件事，让她准备好应对我的反应。我应该告诉她，我即将解除她保守那个秘密的负担。我应该让她知道，她不再需要担心保守我们友谊的秘密了。

Or maybe I shouldn't do any of that. Maybe I should just delete this whole goddamn e-mail to Shinji and continue the damn charade. I move the cursor away from the send button. I... I can't do this, I shake my head in frustration, I really can't do this. What am I expecting to get out of this? Friendship? After all I did to Shinji, I can't just waltz back in like this.  
或者也许我根本不应该做这些。也许我应该直接删除这封该死的给真嗣的邮件，继续这场该死的伪装。我将光标从发送按钮上移开。我……我做不到，我沮丧地摇了摇头，我真的做不到。我期望从这得到什么？友谊吗？在我对真嗣做了那么多之后，我不能就这样大摇大摆地回来。

I save the e-mail into my drafts and pick up my phone. I am going to do one thing though, I'm going to call Rei. I need to speak to someone about what is happening to me. Maybe she can help me make sense of all of this.  
我将邮件保存到草稿箱，拿起手机。不过，我要做一件事，我要给绫波打电话。我需要和某人谈谈我正在经历的事情。也许她能帮我理清这一切。

I pick up my phone and select her name from the contact book. She should be free around this time, it's not too late over in Japan. The phone rings for a few moments and then finally someone answers. I'm about to speak when I'm suddenly stopped by another voice, _'Hello?'_  
我从手机里选中了她的名字，拨了出去。这个时间她应该有空，日本那边还不算太晚。电话响了几声，终于有人接了。我正要开口，却被另一个声音打断，'喂？'

Shinji... 真嗣...

My mouth goes dry instantly as I close it and try not to make any sound. A churning started up in my stomach as moments pass. He speaks again, _'Hello?'_  
我瞬间口干舌燥，闭上嘴尽量不发出声音。随着时间的流逝，胃里开始翻江倒海。他又问了一遍，'喂？'

I hold the phone away from me and stare at it in wide eyed fear. My entire body is shaking as I just sit on the edge of my sofa looking at the phone. Shinji is on the other end of the line. I can hear his voice clearly. I can... I... I can... I can't breathe.  
我把手機拿遠，瞪大眼睛驚恐地盯著它。整個人都在顫抖，只是坐在沙發邊緣盯著手機。真嗣在另一端。我能清楚地聽到他的聲音。我...我...我...我無法呼吸。

_'Hello? Is anyone there?'_ He speaks for a third time with a slight hint of annoyance in his voice. Around me everything seems to slow down. My thumb moves over to the button to end the call and it cuts off before I can hear him for a fourth time. I sit staring straight ahead in a trance like state and feel the phone fall out of my hands and land on the floor.  
'喂？有人在嗎？' 他第三次說話，語氣中帶著一絲不耐煩。周圍的一切似乎都慢了下來。我的拇指移到結束通話的按鈕上，在聽到他第四次說話之前就切斷了。我呆呆地坐著，盯著前方，感覺手機從手中滑落，掉在地上。

That was Shinji Ikari. Shinji answered Rei's phone for her. He... He was actually there on the other end of the line. That was actually his voice I heard.  
那是真嗣·碇。真嗣替綾波接了電話。他...他真的在那頭。那真的是他的聲音。

I slowly rise to my feet and just stand still for a moment trying to picture what he must have looked like as he held her phone and spoke to me. I try to imagine the confusion or annoyance on his face as he was met by only silence. I wonder if he knew it was me? I can't think straight but I think Rei has me on her phone under a different name. I wonder if she really does though. What if he knows now? What if he figures it out? How could I have been so foolish to have called her like that. I should have known there was a chance of this happening.  
我缓缓站起身，静静地站了一会儿，试图想象他拿着她的手机跟我说话时的样子。我试着想象他面对沉默时的困惑或恼怒表情。我不知道他是否知道是我？我无法清晰思考，但我想丽在我的手机上用的是另一个名字。不过，我真的不确定她是否真的这么做了。万一他现在知道了怎么办？万一他猜出来了呢？我怎么会这么愚蠢，那样给她打电话。我早该知道这种情况有可能发生。

I completely forgot the rules we had set down. I would text her first and then she would call me back. We said we would do this so that we could avoid a situation like this. I'm... I'm an idiot! I'm a damn fool!  
我完全忘记了我们定下的规则。我会先给她发短信，然后她再回拨给我。我们说好这样做是为了避免这种情况。我……我真是个白痴！我真是个该死的傻瓜！

I slowly start to come back to reality and I can feel something bubbling up inside of me. A familiar yet hated feeling, rage. My hands curl up into fists and I consider driving one of them into my legs in frustration. I manage to stop myself and instead reach for the closest object, a controller. I throw it full force towards the wall opposite me.  
我慢慢地回到现实，感觉到某种熟悉而又讨厌的情绪在内心涌动，愤怒。我的手握成了拳头，我考虑用力捶打自己的腿以发泄挫败感。我设法控制住自己，转而伸手去拿最近的东西，一个控制器。我用尽全力将它扔向对面的墙壁。

"IDIOT! IDIOT! IDIOT!" I scream out as I hear the sound of plastic smashing against the plaster of the wall. I see the controller break apart on impact and fall to the floor in pieces. I have nothing left to throw so instead I drive my fists repeatedly into the sofa shouting with each punch that lands. Finally, I collapse to my knees in exhaustion, my face leaning on the cushion. I can feel tears welling up in my eyes but I blink them away.  
“白痴！白痴！白痴！”我尖叫着，听到塑料撞击墙壁的声响。我看到控制器在撞击下碎裂，散落一地。我已无物可掷，于是转而用拳头反复捶打沙发，每击一拳都伴随着喊叫。最终，我筋疲力尽地跪倒在地，脸靠在靠垫上。泪水在眼眶中打转，但我眨眼将其逼回。

I am not going to cry over this damn it! I'm not going to cry! I'm not! I'm not! I'm not! Despite my protests I feel tears trickling down my cheeks as I just kneel and let it happen. Suddenly I hear my phone go off, I jump in fright and stare down anxiously at the phone. I quickly wipe away the tears and with trembling hands reach for the phone. I contemplate letting it go to voice mail but see that it is not from Rei's phone as I feared but instead Kaworu who is calling me.  
我不会为这该死的事哭的！我不会哭！我不会！我不会！我不会！尽管我极力否认，泪水还是顺着脸颊滑落，我只能跪着任由它发生。突然，我听到手机铃声响起，吓得一跳，紧张地盯着手机。我迅速擦干泪水，颤抖着手去拿手机。我考虑让它转接到语音信箱，但看到来电并非我所担心的丽，而是薰。

Of all the times for him to actually call me, why does it have to be now when I'm in the middle of a breakdown? I should just ignore it and let it go to voice mail. I could do that but I can't do that. Instead I answer it and try to keep my voice steady, "H-Hello?"  
他偏偏在这个我崩溃的时候打电话给我，为什么非得是现在？我本可以无视它，让它转接到语音信箱。我可以那样做，但我做不到。相反，我接听了电话，努力保持声音平稳，“喂？”

_'Asuka, is everything okay?'  
'明日香，一切都好吗？'_

Good job Asuka, that was convincing. Guess there was a reason you never did well in school plays.  
干得好，明日香，演得挺像的。看来你在学校剧里表现不佳是有原因的。

"I'm fine!" “我没事！”

Even better, I go from sounding miserable and upset to snapping at him. Thankfully he doesn't seem to notice.  
更妙的是，我从听起来痛苦和沮丧变成了对他厉声呵斥。幸运的是，他似乎没有注意到。

_'Good, I am glad to hear that. Asuka, the reason I'm calling is... Well...'_ He trails off nervously which causes me to shift up a bit. I wonder if everything is alright with him, _'I don't think... I've thanked you properly for the last few weeks. Your help and your friendship has been invaluable.'_  
'很好，听到这个我很高兴。明日香，我打电话的原因是...嗯...' 他紧张地停顿了一下，这让我稍微挪动了一下。我在想他是不是一切都好，'我觉得...我还没有好好感谢你过去几周的帮助。你的帮助和友谊非常宝贵。'

My hand tightens around my phone, "Idiot, don't worry about it! It's nothing, I'm just being a good friend."  
我握紧手机，"笨蛋，别担心！没什么，我只是尽了一个好朋友的责任。"

He laughs but I feel my chest tightening. A good friend? Me? No, never, I could never be a good friend to someone, least of all to him. I have to get out of his, "Anyway, there is no need to thank me. Anyone would have done the same."  
他笑了，但我感到胸口一阵紧缩。好朋友？我？不，绝不可能，我永远不可能成为某人的好朋友，尤其是对他。我必须离开这里，“总之，没必要谢我。任何人都会这么做的。”

_'No, I do not believe they would Asuka. From what I have seen of being on this world few would go out of their way like you did. You... who had every reason to hate me because of who and what I was. You who... had no reason to help or be my friend. You... Well I wanted to thank you by asking if you would like to have dinner with me tonight?'  
“不，我不相信他们会像你这样，明日香。在这个世界上，我见过的很少有人会像你那样不遗余力。你……因为我是谁、我是什么而完全有理由恨我。你……没有任何理由帮助我或成为我的朋友。你……我本想通过邀请你今晚共进晚餐来表达我的感谢，你愿意吗？”_

I'm about to say something about not needing to thank me but the words get stuck in my throat as I realize what it is he has just said. Kaworu has just asked me to have dinner with him. Is this some sort of date? Nah, it can't be, he'll barely even know what romance or dating it. He is just being a friend and... as a friend I'll accept. Maybe it'll be good to get out of here.  
我正想说不需要感谢我，但话到嘴边却卡住了，因为我意识到他刚才说了什么。渚薰刚刚邀请我共进晚餐。这是某种约会吗？不，不可能，他几乎不懂什么是浪漫或约会。他只是作为朋友……作为朋友我会接受。也许出去走走会不错。

"Yes... Yes, that would be nice." I finally say.  
“是的... 是的，那会很好。”我终于说道。

'Great!' He almost shouts in excitement at hearing me say that, _'Then would you like to meet me at my place at half seven tonight?'_  
“太好了！”他几乎兴奋地喊出声来，听到我这么说，“那你想今晚七点半来我家见面吗？”

"Yeah." I nod, "That... That sounds great, I'll see you tonight."  
“嗯。”我点头，“那... 那听起来很棒，今晚见。”

We say goodbye to each other and I hand the phone up and the weird churning returns to my stomach. I try to think of it positively but something in the back of my mind says I should have said no. That it won't be good to get out of here. I try to ignore that thought, it's just dinner. He is just being nice.  
我们互相道别，我挂断电话，那种奇怪的翻腾感又回到了我的胃里。我试图往好处想，但脑海深处有个声音说我应该拒绝。离开这里不会是好事。我试图忽视这个念头，这只是晚餐。他只是出于好意。

I wander over slowly to the broken controller and pick up the various pieces, "Well Asuka... I guess you'd better go and buy yourself a new controller... and a new dress."  
我慢慢走过去，捡起破碎的控制器碎片，“好吧，明日香……看来你最好去买个新控制器……还有新裙子。”

**Rei Ayanami 绫波零**

**Tokyo-2 东京-2**

I can still feel an amount of paint on my hands as I reach up and open the door to our apartment. I've already washed my hands but I still feel like I'll need to shower for quite some time to feel completely clean. I didn't think it'd be possible to make quite that much mess but with a large amount of paint and a number of small children around it was inevitable.  
当我伸手打开我们公寓的门时，我仍能感觉到手上残留的油漆。虽然已经洗过手了，但我还是觉得需要洗很久的澡才能彻底感觉干净。我没想到会弄得这么乱，但有大量的油漆和一群小孩子在一起，这几乎是不可避免的。

I can't help but smile as I think about what might await me next week when I'm there. I cannot say that it hasn't been a rewarding experience working at the school. At first, I was not sure that it would be for a person such as myself but it turns out I've actually really enjoyed the experience. The children are, on most occasions, well behaved and I feel a certain sense of joy and pride when I am able to do things that help them.  
想到下周在那里可能发生的事情，我不禁微笑起来。我不能说在学校工作不是一种有意义的经历。起初，我不确定这对像我这样的人是否合适，但事实证明，我真的很享受这段经历。大多数时候，孩子们都很听话，当我能做一些帮助他们的事情时，我感到一种喜悦和自豪。

One of my proudest moments was when a boy had to read to me and I was able to help him get through the book. He seemed so happy that he was able to make his way through the entire thing with minimal mistakes. He has already promised me that he will find new books to read on his own and to me. I am looking forward to the experience.  
我最自豪的时刻之一是，一个男孩需要读给我听，我帮助他顺利读完了整本书。他似乎非常高兴，能够几乎没有错误地读完整本书。他已经向我承诺，他会找到新书自己阅读并读给我听。我期待着这个经历。

I admit, I was quite apprehensive about taking the role. I am aware of my differences not just in the way I act but also in my appearance. Due to how I was 'born' I do not look the same as others. Although now I am completely human I still retain my natural blue hair, pale skin and red eyes.  
我承认，接受这个角色时我相当忐忑。我清楚自己不仅在行为方式上与众不同，外表亦是如此。由于我‘出生’的方式，我看起来与他人并不相同。尽管现在我已完全成为人类，但我依然保留着天生的蓝发、苍白的皮肤和红眼睛。

I have observed that there are many others who find my appearance to be quite curious. I can feel their stares on me when I am outside and I can see or hear them whispering to one another. I have heard their comments and shouts and although I would like to say I can ignore them I simply cannot. Many have been hurtful, although I try not to show it.  
我发现许多人对我的外貌颇感兴趣。我在户外时能感受到他们的目光，也能看到或听到他们窃窃私语。我听过他们的评论和呼喊，虽然我希望自己能无视这些，但实在难以做到。许多言论伤人至深，尽管我尽量不表露出来。

Before taking this role, I did speak to Misato, Shinji and even Asuka about that subject. I suggested that perhaps I should dye my hair to brown and wear contacts to mask the more extreme elements of how I look. Both Misato and Shinji were against it. They said I should be myself.  
在担任这个角色之前，我曾与美里、真嗣甚至明日香讨论过这个问题。我提议或许我应该把头发染成棕色，戴上隐形眼镜来掩饰我外貌中较为极端的特征。但美里和真嗣都反对这样做。他们认为我应该做自己。

Asuka how, she was more adamant in telling me what I should do. In fact, it's probably the only time since returning that I have heard anything of the old Asuka come out. Asuka yelled at me, she called me an idiot and a few worse names too as well as asking me if I was stupid. She then threatened me, told me that if I dared to change my appearance like that because of other people she'd personally fly to Japan and wash the dye out of my hair and put the contact lenses in the bin.  
明日香如何，她更坚决地告诉我应该怎么做。事实上，这可能是自归来后我唯一一次听到旧日明日香的声音。明日香对我大喊大叫，她骂我是白痴，还有更难听的话，还问我是不是傻。她接着威胁我，说如果我敢因为别人而改变外貌，她会亲自飞到日本，把我的染发洗掉，把隐形眼镜扔进垃圾桶。

I still wonder if maybe I should have gone through with it just to see if she carried out that threat. I'd happily endure her yelling and shouting just to have her back in Japan again. Maybe she could have patched things up with Misato and Shinji and they could all be happy again. I really want her to come back, I want Shinji to know what she is well. I know how much the two of them miss one another and it hurts me so much to keep this a secret.  
我仍然在想，也许我应该真的去尝试一下，看看她是否会兑现那个威胁。我愿意忍受她的吼叫和责骂，只为让她再次回到日本。也许她能和美里、真嗣和好如初，他们都能重新快乐起来。我真的希望她回来，我想让真嗣了解她的真实情况。我知道他们俩有多想念对方，而我却要保守这个秘密，这让我心痛不已。

In the end I decided to retain my appearance. As it turns out the children did not care about it, I did get a few questions from them as to why my hair was blue and my eyes were red so I just told them it was because of a condition I was born with. I didn't mention that the condition was in fact that I am a clone of one of the finest scientists of her generation crossed with an ancient god like being.  
最终，我决定保持我的外貌。事实证明，孩子们对此并不在意，只是有几个孩子问我为什么我的头发是蓝色的，眼睛是红色的，我便告诉他们这是我天生的一种状况。我没有提及这种状况实际上是因为我是她那一代最杰出科学家之一的克隆体，与一位古老神灵般的存在的结合。

The children simply shrugged and went back to whatever it was they were doing before. This taught me that children do not seem to care too much about things like that. They get curious and will ask questions but accept things, it seems to be that they start to care most when adults tell them that they should care.  
孩子们只是耸了耸肩，继续做他们之前在做的事情。这让我明白，孩子们似乎并不太在意这类事情。他们可能会好奇并提问，但似乎一旦接受了这些事情，他们就开始在意，而这种在意往往是在成年人告诉他们应该在意之后才开始的。

I enter the front room and I turn to see Shinji sat on the sofa, he's currently reading through some manga of his. At his feet I can see his cello case. I almost forgot, today was the first group session for him. I wonder how it went, I know he was very nervous about it.  
我走进客厅，转身看到真嗣坐在沙发上，他正在阅读他的漫画。在他脚边，我看到了他的大提琴盒。我差点忘了，今天是他的第一次小组会议。我不知道进展如何，我知道他对此非常紧张。

"I'm home." I announce as I set my own bag down.  
"我回来了。" 我放下自己的包宣布道。

Shinji looked up from his manga and smiles at me, "Oh hey Rei! Welcome home."  
真嗣从他的漫画中抬起头，对我微笑道，"哦，嘿，绫波！欢迎回家。"

"Thank you." I sit down on the chair near to him, "How was your group session today?"  
"谢谢。" 我在他附近的椅子上坐下，"今天的小组会议怎么样？"

I see Shinji continue to smile at me, "It… was really good."  
我看到真嗣继续对我微笑，“那…真的很棒。”

A small smile comes to my own lips as I hear him say that. It makes me so happy that he found it to be good. I was nervous that it would be an unpleasant experience for him.  
听到他这么说，我嘴角也露出了微笑。他觉得好，这让我非常高兴。我之前还担心他会觉得不愉快。

"It was… scary at first but I think… I just need time. I need to keep going and maybe it eventually won't be as scary."  
“一开始…很可怕，但我想…我需要时间。我需要继续前进，也许最终就不会那么可怕了。”

"That is good to hear. Familiarity with the activity and the people will ease your nerves in such an environment."  
听到这个消息真好。熟悉活动和人群会减轻你在这种环境下的紧张感。

He nods, "Yeah… I think I just need to learn that people probably aren't going to recognize who I am. I keep on thinking that one day they will and… bad things will happen but… maybe they don't know who any of us are."  
他点点头，"是啊……我想我需要学会，人们可能不会认出我是谁。我一直以为有一天他们会认出我，然后……会发生不好的事情，但……也许他们并不知道我们任何一个人的身份。"

I nod back at him but at the back of my mind I can hear Asuka's words about Nagisa being attacked. I admit I have been more on edge when outside after hearing about that. I should have asked for more information on the incident but I did not think to at the time. She mentioned that the people who did it were part of the UN Agency that protects us but what their motive was.  
我朝他点点头，但脑海中回响着明日香关于渚被攻击的话。我承认，自从听到那件事后，我在外面时变得更加紧张了。我当时应该多问一些关于那次事件的信息，但那时没想到。她提到那些做这件事的人是保护我们的联合国机构的一部分，但他们的动机是什么。

Did they know who Nagisa was from before? Did they attack him because of who he was? If so then we should be safe. How were they able to find that out though? Information related to us is classified, unless perhaps they were a part of NERV when it happened. They would not be the only Section 2 agents who would go on to work for the agency.  
他们之前知道渚是谁吗？他们是因为他的身份才攻击他的吗？如果是这样的话，我们应该安全了。但他们是怎么发现这一点的呢？与我们相关的信息是保密的，除非他们当时是 NERV 的成员。他们不会是唯一后来为该机构工作的第二部门特工。

"Oh Rei, you left your phone here!" Shinji suddenly announces, snapping me from my thoughts. He gets up and wanders over to the drawer unit near my bedroom. As he does I look into my handbag in confusion and look, it seems he is correct. I did leave my phone here, I take the device from him.  
“哦，丽，你把手机落在这儿了！”真嗣突然宣布，打断了我的思绪。他起身走到我卧室附近的抽屉柜旁。与此同时，我困惑地看向我的手提包，果然，他是对的。我确实把手机落在这里了，我从他手中接过设备。

"Someone tried to call you earlier as well!" He tells me.  
“之前也有人试图给你打电话！”他告诉我。

"Oh." I look at him, "Who was it?"  
"哦。" 我看着他，"是谁打来的？"

Shinji shakes his head as he returns to his seat, "I don't know, one of those weird marketing calls I think. They were just silent after I answered it. It came up as a private number so I couldn't check.  
真嗣摇摇头，回到自己的座位上，"我不知道，可能是那些奇怪的营销电话吧。我接了之后对方就沉默了。来电显示是私人号码，所以我也没法查。

A private number… I feel a churning in my stomach as I look back towards my phone and immediately go to the call history. Sure enough it is listed there, 'PRIVATE NUMBER', I tap the icon and I see her information displayed immediately. Just as I suspected, it was Asuka and Shinji had been the one to answer my phone. He actually spoke to her and yet he has no idea about it as well. He doesn't know just how close he come to hearing that voice he has longed to hear for so very long.  
私人号码……我回头看向自己的手机，胃里一阵翻腾，立刻查看了通话记录。果然，那里显示着'私人号码'，我点击图标，她的信息立刻显示出来。正如我所料，是明日香，而真嗣接了我的电话。他确实和她通话了，却对此一无所知。他不知道自己离那个渴望已久的声音有多近。

My own foolishness in leaving my phone behind nearly exposed the secret I've tried to keep. Asuka is going to be angry at me for this. I need to try to put it right. I try to show no signs of nervousness and try to remind myself that her number was put in there as 'PRIVATE NUMBER' for this very reason. It was in case someone such as Misato or Shinji got hold of my phone should Asuka call me.  
我自己的愚蠢，把手机落下了，差点暴露了我一直试图保守的秘密。明日香对此肯定会生气。我得设法补救。我尽量不表现出紧张，并提醒自己，她的号码被存为'私人号码'正是为了这个原因。以防万一，万一美里或真嗣拿到了我的手机，而明日香又恰好打给我。

I also remind myself that Asuka calling me first is not a part of how we regularly communicate. It is always supposed to be me who calls her unless we arrange it the other way around. Both of these facts should serve to reassure me. It all went according to our plans, her secret has been kept and yet I do not feel good about this.  
我也提醒自己，明日香先打给我并不是我们常规的沟通方式。通常应该是我打给她，除非我们事先约定好反过来。这两个事实本应让我安心。一切都按我们的计划进行，她的秘密得以保守，然而我对此并不感到安心。

"Thank you." I finally utter to Shinji, keeping my voice as steady as I can. I go to my e-mails and text messages to see if perhaps she has sent me anything. As of now she hasn't, I shall contact her later myself to see what has happened.  
“谢谢。”我终于对真嗣说道，尽量保持声音平稳。我查看我的电子邮件和短信，看她是否发了什么给我。目前还没有，稍后我会联系她，看看发生了什么。

I am concerned that she would call me like this. I wonder if perhaps what I feared would happen has actually happened. Perhaps Nagisa has hurt her in some way. It is another thought I have to push out of my head for the moment. It is illogical to think such a thing has happened. Asuka is more than capable of handling herself and she is under protection. Nagisa is fragile in his human form as well, I do not suspect he could have hurt her.  
我担心她会这样打电话给我。我在想，我害怕的事情是否真的发生了。也许渚以某种方式伤害了她。这是我目前必须排除的另一个念头。这样想是不合逻辑的。明日香完全有能力自保，而且她受到保护。渚在人形状态下也很脆弱，我不认为他能伤害她。

Yet I worry about their relationship all the same. I am confused by the nature of their relationship. I would not have expected them to have become friends and yet there they are. I have been thinking about Asuka's words from our last phone call. I have been trying to understand how she and Nagisa are not that different but I am not seeing it for myself.  
尽管如此，我仍然担心他们的关系。我对他们关系的本质感到困惑。我本以为他们不会成为朋友，但他们确实如此。我一直在思考明日香上次通话时说的话。我试图理解她和渚并没有那么不同，但我自己却看不出来。

In regards to Asuka, she was at times an unpleasant person to deal with. She could be rude and arrogant, loud and obnoxious but there were moments when he true self shone through. She was brave, she was protective and she was warm. She would be the one trying to include everyone in activities. If she saw me alone she would drag me into the group. She would even go to an effort to make sure Touji and Kensuke were involved despite claiming she hated them.  
关于明日香，她有时确实是个难以相处的人。她可能粗鲁且傲慢，大声又令人讨厌，但也有时刻能展现出她真实的一面。她勇敢，她保护他人，她热情。她总是努力让每个人都参与到活动中。如果她看到我独自一人，她会把我拉进群体。即使她声称讨厌他们，她也会费心确保真嗣和健介参与其中。

For Nagisa, he was aware of what he was and what it was he was doing. I did not feel any attempt from him to escape that destiny. He fulfilled his goal without questioning it and he hurt my brother deeply. I do not feel that I should forgive Nagisa for any of this but then I also trust Asuka and her judgement when it comes to people. If she is capable of befriending Nagisa than perhaps I am wrong?  
对于渚薰，他清楚自己是谁以及自己在做什么。我没有感觉到他有任何逃避命运的企图。他毫无质疑地完成了自己的目标，深深伤害了我的哥哥。我不觉得我应该原谅渚薰的这些行为，但同时我也信任明日香和她对人判断的能力。如果她能够与渚薰成为朋友，那么或许是我错了？

I need to think about this some more and perhaps talk to Asuka about it properly. I do wish I had someone else I could confide in about this issue. Misato would be a good person to talk to but I cannot reveal to her the secret I am keeping. This has become so complicated, for all I have learned in the past five years there is so much that confuses me. Humans are such complicated creatures, myself included.  
我需要再仔细考虑一下，或许应该和明日香好好谈谈。我真希望还有其他人可以倾诉这个问题。美里是个不错的人选，但我不能向她透露我保守的秘密。这一切变得如此复杂，尽管过去五年我学到了很多，但仍有许多事情让我困惑。人类是如此复杂的生物，我自己也不例外。

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

**Berlin - Evening 柏林 - 傍晚**

I have been unable to keep the smile from my lips ever since I spoke to Asuka earlier today. So much so that I am sure Fuyutsuki and the others I work with thought that something was wrong with me. Asuka said yes to me. She said yes to my request of having dinner tonight!  
自从今天早些时候和明日香通话后，我的嘴角就一直挂着笑容，以至于我确信富士树和同事们一定以为我出了什么问题。明日香答应了我。她答应了今晚和我共进晚餐的请求！

I was so worried that she would say no. I am aware from various bits of reading that being asked out to dinner is seen as a romantic gesture for humans. I am not entirely sure if that is how I meant it to be. I just enjoy spending time with Asuka and wished to make up for all the help she has given me recently.  
我非常担心她会拒绝。我从各种阅读材料中了解到，对人类来说，被邀请共进晚餐被视为一种浪漫的举动。我不完全确定我是否也是这个意思。我只是喜欢和明日香在一起，并希望弥补她最近给予我的所有帮助。

Yet, I have wondered about the subject of romance since I returned. Would I like to become romantically involved with someone? At first, I was not so sure, I was so afraid of people that I was happy just keeping to myself. As time went on and I was exposed to a little bit more literature and media I did start to wonder what it might be like to be involved with another. I wondered what it might be like to have a companion, to have someone to hold and to love, someone who I could kiss, touch even make love to.  
然而，自从回来后，我对浪漫这个话题产生了好奇。我会想与某人建立浪漫关系吗？起初，我不太确定，我非常害怕人群，只满足于独处。随着时间的推移，当我接触到更多的文学和媒体时，我开始好奇与另一个人在一起会是什么感觉。我想知道拥有一个伴侣，有一个人可以拥抱和爱，可以亲吻、触摸甚至做爱会是什么感觉。

These were all things that I did not ever consider in my past life. Romance and sex meant nothing to me, they were all human pursuits and as such I did not have any urges in that manner. I felt things for people of course, nothing stronger than what I felt for Shinji Ikari but I knew my time was limited so I did not permit myself to dwell on such feelings.  
这些都是我在过去的生活中从未考虑过的事情。浪漫和性对我来说毫无意义，它们都是人类的追求，因此我没有那种冲动。当然，我对人有感觉，但没有比我对碇真嗣的感觉更强烈的了，但我知道我的时间有限，所以我不会让自己沉溺于这种感情。

My time is no longer limited though and as such I find such thoughts creeping into my mind more and more. I think about the sort of person I would perhaps like as a companion. I think about what preferences I have romantically and even sexually. In my meditations on the subject I find that issues such as gender are not a factor for me. I seem to find beauty across the entire spectrum of gender.  
尽管我的时间不再受限，但我发现这样的思绪越来越频繁地潜入我的脑海。我开始思考自己可能会喜欢什么样的伴侣。我思考自己在情感和性方面的偏好。在对此主题的沉思中，我发现性别问题对我来说并不重要。我似乎能在各种性别中找到美。

Sexually I feel very much the same. Whilst I have not had a sexual encounter with another person yet I have had to deal with certain urges that arise most on evenings. When dealing with said urges I have observed a number of acts, some appeal to me more than others but again I find sexual attraction across the gender spectrum.  
在性方面，我也有类似的感受。虽然我尚未与他人有过性经历，但我不得不处理某些在夜晚最为强烈的冲动。在应对这些冲动时，我观察了许多行为，有些比其他的更吸引我，但同样，我在性别光谱上发现了性吸引力。

There is one person who has been occupying my thoughts on occasions like this though, that of course is Asuka. I wonder what exactly I feel about her. I find her to be an extraordinary person. I am no longer able to sense people's souls like I once was it is not difficult for me to see the fragility of her heart. I know she has been through a lot of hardship in her life and she, much like Shinji Ikari deserve so much happiness.  
尽管如此，有一个人在这种时候占据了我的思绪，那就是明日香。我想知道我对她究竟有什么感觉。我发现她是一个非凡的人。我不再能像以前那样感知人们的灵魂，但我很容易看到她内心的脆弱。我知道她经历了许多苦难，她和碇真嗣一样，值得拥有很多幸福。

Yet despite the hardship she is a kind person. She reached out to me when she had no reason to. She helped me when no one else was able to and when I think of her I smile. I find her to be such a figure of beauty as well. Everything about her from her fiery red hair, he expressive blue eyes and her smile and hits me inside. I find that I am unable to take my eyes off of her when in the same room, there is something powerful about mer.  
尽管她历经艰辛，却依然心地善良。她在我毫无理由时向我伸出了援手。在我无人能助时，她帮助了我，每当我想到她，总会露出微笑。我觉得她是一个美丽的化身，从她那火红的头发，到她那充满表情的蓝眼睛，再到她的微笑，都深深触动了我。当我们在同一个房间时，我发现自己无法将目光从她身上移开，她身上有一种强大的力量。

Perhaps… Perhaps then I do like her romantically but I wonder if this is because she is new for me. She is something I have not experiences before. I wonder if maybe I have not lived long enough to feel such things. I wonder what the rules for this sort of thing are, if there are any rules at all.  
或许……或许我对她产生了浪漫的情感，但我怀疑这是否因为她对我来说是全新的体验。她是我未曾经历过的事物。我不知道自己是否活得足够久，以至于能感受到这样的情感。我不知道这种事情是否有规则可循，如果有的话，又是什么规则。

Of course, it is not just my feelings that matter in this situation. If I find Asuka attractive and I wish for more than friendship than that is one thing but it means little if those feelings are no reciprocated. Would Asuka find someone such as myself attractive? I am already aware that I do not look like a regular person. My appearance is not normal, I receive numerous stares from people every day that remind me of that. I receive comments every so often that remind me of that.  
当然，在这件事上不仅仅是我个人的感受重要。如果我觉得明日香有吸引力，并且我希望超越友谊，那是一回事，但如果这些感情没有得到回应，那就意义不大了。明日香会觉得像我这样的人有吸引力吗？我已经知道我不像一个普通人。我的外表不正常，每天都有无数的目光提醒我这一点。偶尔也会有人评论，提醒我这一点。

In a way that sort of thing does bother me, I cannot help the way I look. I was not given that choice and I do not feel I should change this for others. Even if such a thing is a hindrance in future matters. I am Kaworu Nagisa, I have silvery hair, red eyes and pale skin. That is who I am and I will not erase that.  
在某种程度上，这种事情确实让我烦恼，我无法改变自己的外貌。我没有被赋予这个选择，我也不觉得我应该为了别人而改变这一点。即使这在未来的事情中是一个障碍。我是渚薰，我有银色的头发，红色的眼睛和苍白的皮肤。这就是我，我不会抹去这一点。

I frown as I try to put these thoughts out of my mind for the moment. Asuka will be here in a few minutes and it would not be good to be pre-occupied with these thoughts. I need to focus on ensuring I am a good host for her during this dinner.  
我皱起眉头，试图暂时把这些想法抛诸脑后。明日香几分钟后就会到，如果我被这些想法困扰，那就不好了。我需要集中精力确保在这顿晚餐中成为她的好主人。

I look towards the living room and see the small dining table I have set up there. Across it is a delicate white cloth with two plain but elegant looking mats either side for the plates. Either side of the mats I've arrange cutlery according to a guide on dinner parts I have read. In the centre of the table is a candle that I'll light during dinner.  
我望向客厅，看到了我在那里布置的小餐桌。对面是一块精致的白色桌布，两侧各有一张朴素却雅致的垫子供盘子使用。垫子两侧，我按照读过的餐具指南摆放了餐具。桌子中央是一根蜡烛，晚餐时我会将其点燃。

Currently sitting in my fridge are ten bottles of wine. I did not think to ask at the time what sort of wine Asuka liked and felt it would be silly to call her. Having not sampled the substance myself yet I did not know what would work with the meal I was going to cook. So naturally I panicked and bought a sample of everything. This did earn me some strange glares from people, unfortunately I am not exactly able to explain my origins and therefore my reasoning for such a thing. All I could do was smile at the cashier.  
目前冰箱里放着十瓶葡萄酒。当时没想起问明日香喜欢什么酒，又觉得打电话问她太傻。自己还没尝过酒，也不知道哪种酒适合我打算做的菜。于是自然就慌了，买了一堆样品。这确实让我收到了一些奇怪的眼神，遗憾的是我无法解释自己的来历，因此也无法说明这么做的理由。我只能对收银员微笑。

The meal tonight will be a steak in a peppercorn sauce with a variety of vegetables that I have spent the last half an hour preparing. This will be followed by a homemade chocolate ice cream that I perfected making yesterday.  
今晚的菜肴将是黑胡椒牛排搭配我花了半小时准备的各式蔬菜。之后是一道我昨天刚完善的自制巧克力冰淇淋。

I look towards the kitchen clock once again and feel the nerves building up in my stomach. Questions start to go through my mind, what if Asuka doesn't come? What if she dislikes the food? What if I haven't done this right and she laughs at me? I take a deep breath, this is going to be fine, it's just a dinner for a girl I happen to like and who I am friends with.  
我又一次望向厨房的时钟，感到紧张在胃里翻腾。疑问开始在脑海中盘旋，如果明日香不来怎么办？如果她不喜欢这些食物怎么办？如果我做得不对，她嘲笑我怎么办？我深吸一口气，一切都会好的，这只是为了一位我恰好喜欢且是朋友的女孩子准备的晚餐。

Half a minute later there is a knock on my door and I take another deep breath. I answer the door and find myself rendered unable to speak when I see her stood before me. Asuka is wearing a long dark red dress with red gloves to match. She has straightened her hair and put on a small amount of make up with draw my attention to her eyes. Around her neck is a black choker with a little gold diamond hanging from the middle. She looks beautiful.  
半分钟后，门上传来敲击声，我又深吸了一口气。我打开门，看到她站在我面前时，竟一时语塞。明日香穿着一件深红色的长裙，搭配着同色的手套。她把头发拉直了，化了淡妆，让我不由自主地注视着她的眼睛。她的脖子上戴着一条黑色项圈，中间挂着一颗小小的金色钻石。她看起来美极了。

"A-Asuka…" I finally stammer out before moving to one side to let her in, "Come on in."  
“明……明日香……”我终于结结巴巴地说出口，然后侧身让她进来，“请进。”

She gives me a smile and nods, "Thank you."  
她对我微笑并点头，“谢谢你。”

She walks forward and enters the living room with me following behind. I smile as I see her stop and look towards the table. It is her turn to look stunned, "T-This is… I thought we were…"  
她向前走去，我跟随其后进入客厅。我微笑着看她停下脚步，望向桌子。轮到她显得震惊了，“这…这是…我以为我们…”

I make my way to the table, "I… Wanted to thank you for all you have done for me Asuka. I understand that cooking someone dinner is a good way of doing that."  
我走向桌子，“我…想感谢你为我所做的一切，明日香。我知道为某人做饭是表达感谢的好方式。”

"You… Cook, I thought you meant go out this is…"  
"你…库克，我以为你说的是出去吃，这…"

I smile and shake my head, "I admit that perhaps I am… perhaps not going to be as good as a high end restaurant but I wanted to do something for you. You have done so much for me, you… are not disappointed are you?"  
我微笑着摇摇头，"我承认可能我…也许不如高档餐厅做得好，但我就是想为你做点什么。你为我做了这么多，你…不会失望吧？"

She looks me, "No you idiot! I'm not… this is… really nice."  
她看着我，"不，你这个傻瓜！我不是…这…真的很棒。"

"Good, I am glad." "很好，我很高兴。"

She remains frozen to the spot and I watch as her eyes keep going from the table to me and back again. I try to ignore the butterflies in my stomach as I move towards the fridge, "I was… unsure of what wine you would like so I got a selection. I believe certain wines are said to go better with specific types of food. We are eating a steak with vegetables in a homemade sauce. Yet I also hear people have preferences for wine based on country and colour, perhaps you should pick?"  
她依旧呆立在原地，我看着她的目光在桌子和我的身上来回游移。我努力忽视胃里翻腾的紧张感，走向冰箱，“我……不确定你喜欢哪种葡萄酒，所以选了几种。据说某些葡萄酒与特定的食物更搭配。我们今晚吃的是牛排配蔬菜自制酱汁。不过我也听说人们会根据国家和颜色偏好选择葡萄酒，也许你应该来挑选？”

There is no reply from her as I turn around and see her still frozen in place, "Asuka, is everything alright?"  
我转过身，她依然僵立不动，没有回应，“明日香，一切都好吗？”

She nods slowly, "I… You… I… I can't… This is… I'm sorry Kaworu."  
她缓缓点头，“我……你……我……我做不到……这太……对不起，薰。”

I'm barely given a chance to respond before she turns and quickly leaves the living room. I hear my front door slam behind her as I'm left stood in a stunned silence. I don't know what to do, do I go after her? Do I stay here? I try to listen for the footsteps echoing down the hallway and outside but I hear nothing. If I leave now maybe I can catch up with her.  
我几乎没来得及回应，她就转身迅速离开了客厅。我呆立在一片震惊的寂静中，听着她身后大门砰的一声关上。我不知道该怎么办，是追出去还是留在这里？我试图聆听走廊和外面的脚步声，却什么也没听到。如果我现在离开，也许还能追上她。

Questions run through my mind, did I do something wrong? If so what did I do wrong? Was it something I said? Was this perhaps too much for Asuka? None of that matters now I think to myself as I grab my keys and start to go after her. If I upset her I have to apologize, I have to find out what I did.  
疑问在我脑海中盘旋，是我做错了什么吗？如果是，我做错了什么？是因为我说了什么吗？这对明日香来说是不是太过分了？现在这些都不重要了，我自言自语，如果我让她不高兴了，我必须道歉，我必须弄清楚我做了什么。

### Chapter 7: Any Kind Of Sign  
第七章：任何一种迹象  

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I rush out into the hallway and hear the sound of his door slamming itself shut. I hurry along into the entranceway of the complex and pull open the door freeing myself from the confines of the building. A cool breeze immediately hits my face and I stop halfway up the path and take a few deep breaths to calm myself.  
我冲进走廊，听到他的门砰的一声关上了。我急忙走到大楼的入口处，拉开大门，摆脱了建筑的束缚。一阵凉风立刻扑面而来，我在半路上停下，深呼吸几次以平复心情。

My heart is pounding so quickly in my chest now, I can feel sweat trickling down my forehead and a wave of dizziness rushing over me. I prop myself up on a wall unable to go any further at this moment in time.  
我的心现在跳得如此之快，我能感觉到汗水从额头滑落，一阵眩晕感袭来。我靠在墙上支撑自己，此刻无法再向前一步。

I glance guiltily back at the entrance to the building. Kaworu doesn't seem to have followed me. He probably won't, why would he after what I just did? The poor guy probably hasn't got a clue as to what the hell just happened. He's probably stood there next to his oven, devastated after seeing me run out like that. I hope he understands that I had to do it though, I had to run away.  
我内疚地回头看了一眼建筑物的入口。渚薰似乎没有跟上来。他大概不会跟来了，毕竟我刚刚做了那样的事。可怜的家伙可能还一头雾水，不知道到底发生了什么。他现在可能还站在烤箱旁边，因为我那样跑掉而感到难过。不过我希望他能理解我不得不这么做，我必须逃离。

He had gone to so much damn effort, it was perfect and he was perfect. It was all so goddamn nice and what I wanted. He had been thoughtful and nice and was going to prepare a meal and serve wine. He even bought a fucking table with a goddamn candle on it. All of that effort for me? All of that for the wretched example of a human that I am.  
他费了那么多心思，一切都完美无缺，他也是。这一切都太他妈美好了，正是我想要的。他考虑周到，体贴入微，准备了一顿饭还要开瓶酒。他甚至买了一张桌子，上面还放着该死的蜡烛。所有这些努力都是为了我？为了我这个可悲的人类典范。

Kaworu… You think I'm someone I'm not. You think I'm… some nice girl who can be a good friend to you but I'm not that person. I am not…  
渚薰……你以为我是另一个人。你以为我是……一个能成为你好朋友的好女孩，但我不是那个人。我不是……

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

I freeze up as I hear the trembling voice from behind me. I fix my gaze on the road and daren't turn around to look at him. I try to take a step forward but feel only stiffness and pain in my joints. It's just like one of my dreams, I can't move from this spot.  
听到身后颤抖的声音，我僵住了。目光紧盯着路面，不敢回头看他。我试图向前迈一步，却只感到关节僵硬和疼痛。这就像我梦中的一幕，我无法从这个位置移动。

"Did… Did I do something wrong?"  
"我…我做错了什么吗？"

His question is like a knife being thrust into me and twisted. I should have kept running as far from here as I could. Now I have to answer his question and there is only one way I can do that.  
他的问题犹如一把刀刺入我心，还狠狠地拧了一下。我本该继续跑，跑得离这里越远越好。现在我却不得不回答他的问题，而唯一的方式就是……

"Idiot!" I snap back at him. It's all I can do at this time is to revert to that angry frightened girl. I feel my hands curl up into a fist, my nails digging into the palms.  
"白痴！" 我厉声回敬他。此刻我只能变回那个愤怒而恐惧的女孩。我感到双手紧握成拳，指甲深深陷入掌心。

"Please Asuka…" He continues, "I… If I did something wrong then I'd like to know. I apologize for any-"  
"请别这样，明日香……" 他继续说道，"我……如果我做错了什么，我希望知道。我为任何……

"Stop it!" I snap at him again, "You didn't… You did nothing wrong Kaworu, you…"  
"住手！" 我又一次厉声对他说，"你没……你什么都没做错，碇，你……"

My head lowers as I trail off and shake my head. I can't be bothered with fighting anymore, I'm sick of putting up those defences. I've been doing it for so long and I just… I can't bring myself to hurt him. I turn around to finally face him but I can barely meet his gaze.  
我低下头，话音渐弱，摇了摇头。我再也懒得争斗了，厌倦了那些防御。我已经这样做了太久，我只是……我无法让自己伤害他。我转过身来，终于面对他，但我几乎不敢直视他的眼睛。

"It's me Kaworu, I… I'm broken alright." I shrug, "You didn't do anything wrong. Everything you did was fine… It was lovely, in fact it was perfect."  
"是我，碇，我……我确实支离破碎了。" 我耸耸肩，"你什么都没做错。你所做的一切都很好……事实上，那很美好，完美无缺。"

"Then… why did you run?" He asks me, his voice still trembling. It's that trembling in his voice that is getting to me. It's that trembling that cuts into me.  
"那么…你为什么要逃跑？" 他问我，声音依旧颤抖。正是他声音中的颤抖让我心烦意乱。正是那种颤抖刺痛了我。

"Because I don't deserve any of it Kaworu." I answer him as honestly as I can, "You… You're a nice guy but me… I'm not a nice girl, I never have been and…"  
"因为我配不上这些，卡沃鲁。" 我尽可能诚实地回答他，"你…你是个好人，但我…我不是个好女孩，我从来都不是，而且…"

"Asuka…" I watch as he takes a single small step forward. In response I take a step away from him and hold out an arm to stop him.  
"明日香…" 我看着他向前迈了一小步。作为回应，我后退一步，伸出一只手臂阻止他。

"Don't… Don't come any closer to me, just… just stop it Kaworu, you…" I shake my head, "You're only going to get hurt. It's better that I just leave."  
"别……别再靠近我了，就……就停下吧，薰，你……" 我摇着头，"你只会受伤。我最好还是离开。"

"Asuka… Those things that you say you are, those things that you think you are… they are not the person that I have come to know you as. They are not the person that you actually are."  
"明日香……那些你自称是、你认为自己是的那些东西……它们不是我所认识的你。它们不是你真正的样子。"

"How the hell would you know? You've known me for less than a month!" I bark back at him, "You don't know the things I've done to other people! You don't know what I've said to them or how I've hurt them! You don't know what sort of monster I really am!"  
"你他妈怎么可能知道？你认识我还不到一个月！" 我朝他吼回去，"你不知道我对别人做过什么！你不知道我对他们说过什么或我是怎么伤害他们的！你不知道我到底是个什么样的怪物！"

Kaworu lowers his head slightly and I think that maybe I've 'won', maybe I've got that tiny hollow victory that my mind seems to be craving and I can leave this place. I can get away from this and go back to being alone like I deserve. A moment later Kaworu raises his head again and I see no fear in his eyes, only a fierceness as he takes another step towards me.  
渚薰微微低下头，我以为自己或许'赢了'，或许得到了那微不足道的胜利，心里似乎渴望着这种感觉，我可以离开这个地方。我可以摆脱这一切，回到我应得的孤独中去。但片刻后，渚薰再次抬起头，我看到他眼中没有恐惧，只有一种坚定，他又向我迈进一步。

"It is true that I might know have known you for a long time but in that short period of time I can confidently state that the Asuka you claim to be is not really who you are. I may not be able to see into the hearts of others like I once did but… I do not need that to see that you are no monster."  
“虽然我可能认识你的时间不长，但在那短暂的时间里，我可以自信地说，你声称自己是明日香的那个人，并不是真正的你。我可能无法像以前那样看透别人的心，但是……我不需要那样就能看出你不是怪物。”

His words catch me off guard, not only that but his way of speaking too. The trembling in his voice has gone, replaced only by a calm confidence. I open my mouth to reply but no words come out. I contemplate turning and running but I can't.  
他的话让我措手不及，不仅是内容，还有他的说话方式。他声音中的颤抖消失了，取而代之的是一种平静的自信。我张开嘴想要回答，但什么话也说不出来。我考虑转身逃跑，但我做不到。

"You are a kind soul Asuka, you helped me when you had every reason to hate me. You knew what I was and shown no fear of that." He continues, "I want to do the same for you. I do not fear you Asuka, no matter what you say or what you claim I am not scared of you. The mistakes of your past are just that, mistakes in your past."  
"你是个善良的人，明日香，你有无数理由恨我，但你还是帮助了我。你知道我是什么样的人，却毫不畏惧。" 他继续说道，"我也想为你做同样的事。我不怕你，明日香，无论你说什么，无论你声称什么，我都不怕你。你过去的错误就只是过去的错误。"

He takes another step forward, "I have seen what true monsters are in my former masters and you are not like those people. You are not like those people. You are a kind and compassionate soul with a fragile heart, you deserve to be happy."  
他又向前迈了一步，"我在前主人那里见识过真正的怪物是什么样子，而你不是那样的人。你不是那样的人。你是一个善良且富有同情心的灵魂，有一颗脆弱的心，你应该得到幸福。"

Before I know it Kaworu is barely a step away from me. His arms wrap themselves around me pulling me towards him in a warm embrace. I should be fighting this and running away from it but I can't. I'm just so fed up of running away so all I can do is stand there as this guy hugs me. My arms reach up around his back to return the gesture and my head rests itself softly on his shoulder as he rubs my back. I feel a few silent tears trickle down my face as I let him hold me.  
在我意识到之前，渚薰几乎已经站在我面前了。他的手臂环绕着我，将我拉向他，给予一个温暖的拥抱。我本该反抗，本该逃离，但我做不到。我已经厌倦了逃避，所以我只能站在那里，任由他拥抱我。我的手臂环绕在他的背上，回应着他的拥抱，我的头轻轻靠在他的肩膀上，他轻抚着我的背。我感到几滴无声的泪水顺着脸颊滑落，任由他抱着我。

We stay like this for a few moments before he finally breaks the embrace. I look at his face and see him blushing but also smiling at me, "Asuka… Will you still have dinner with me?"  
我们就这样相拥片刻，他终于松开了怀抱。我看着他的脸，发现他既脸红又对我微笑，“明日香……你愿意和我一起吃晚饭吗？”

I start to shake my head but then my stomach lets out an audible growl betraying me. I feel myself blush as I look up at him with a sheepish smile, "Yes… Yes I will."  
我正要摇头，但肚子却发出了一声响亮的咕噜声，出卖了我。我感到自己脸红了，抬头看着他，带着一丝尴尬的微笑，“是的……我会。”

**Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣**

I put the now clean cello bow down on the bedside table and pause the music on my player as I look towards the instrument in the corner of my room with a satisfied smile. I take a moment to actually enjoy the rare sense of pride I get knowing what I was able to accomplish today. I was not only able to go to that session but I actually played in front of other people.  
我把已经擦干净的琴弓放在床头柜上，暂停了音乐播放器，满意地看向房间角落里的乐器。我花了一会儿时间真正享受这种难得的自豪感，知道自己今天取得的成就。我不仅参加了那场演奏会，还在别人面前演奏了。

For me it feels like such a big achievement and I'm trying my best to hold onto that happiness for as long as I am able to. I know that maybe tomorrow or the next day those doubts and fears will start to creep back in but at I want to try to hold onto this happiness for as long as I can.  
对我来说，这感觉像是一项巨大的成就，我正尽全力抓住这份幸福，只要我能做到。我知道也许明天或后天，那些疑虑和恐惧又会悄悄袭来，但此刻我想尽可能长久地留住这份快乐。

As it is my mind has already started to wander to thinking about the next session. I'm already starting to wonder what I can play next time and wondering about playing with the others in the group. This will be the first time, outside of the two teachers I have had, I'll have played music with another person. I'm used to either a metronome or a backing tape so I'm a little bit nervous about the whole thing. I'm also excited and eager to hear what we can all do.  
因为我的思绪已经开始飘向下一节课。我已经开始思考下次可以演奏什么，以及与小组其他人一起演奏的情景。这将是我第一次，除了两位老师之外，与其他人一起演奏音乐。我习惯于使用节拍器或伴奏带，所以对整个过程有点紧张。同时，我也感到兴奋和渴望听到我们能一起创造出什么。

I start to get up from the bed to put the bow back into its box when I hear a soft tapping at my door. I sit back down keeping the bow in my hands and call out, "Come in."  
我正要从床上起身把弓放回盒子里，这时听到门上传来轻轻的敲击声。我重新坐下，手里还拿着弓，喊道：“进来。”

The door slides open partially and Misato playfully pokes her head into my room, "Shinji! I'm not interrupting anything am I?"  
门缓缓地半开，美里俏皮地探头进我的房间，“真嗣！我没打扰到你吧？”

I shake my head, "Hey Misato, No I was just cleaning my cello a bit."  
我摇摇头，“嘿，美里，没有，我只是在清理一下我的大提琴。”

Misato slides the door open fully and steps into my room. She takes a look at the clean cello and then the bow in my hands and grins at me. I can feel myself blushing already as I know what she is about to say.  
美里将门完全推开，走进我的房间。她看了看干净的大提琴，又看了看我手中的弓，朝我咧嘴一笑。我已感觉到自己脸颊发烫，知道她接下来要说什么。

"You know… I'm really proud of you Shinji, it can't have been easy doing that today. Well done."  
"你知道吗…我真的很为你骄傲，真嗣，今天能做到那样肯定不容易。干得好。"

I lower my gaze in embarrassment, I can't say I dislike or don't want the praise from her but it does embarrass me to hear it said so directly, "Thank you, I… I really enjoyed it. I know that… maybe this good feeling won't last but it's a start. I'm feeling… good at the moment."  
我尴尬地垂下目光，虽然我不讨厌也不想拒绝她的赞扬，但直接听到还是让我感到尴尬，“谢谢你，我…我真的喜欢。我知道…也许这种好感觉不会持久，但这是一个开始。我现在感觉…很好。”

"Well that is some progress Shinji! It's just one small step forward but it is a step forward nonetheless so just make sure you keep telling yourself that. When you are scared or doubting yourself just remember that you'd already made a stride down the path and you can keep on going."  
"真嗣，这可是进步啊！虽然只是向前迈出的一小步，但毕竟是一步，所以一定要记住这一点。当你害怕或怀疑自己时，只要记得你已经在这条路上迈出了一大步，你可以继续前进。"

"Yeah… Thank you." I smile back at her, "I'll be going again next week. My tutor said that is going to try to get us to play something together and talk to us about ideas for a show."  
“嗯……谢谢你。”我朝她微笑，“下周我还会再去。我的导师说，他打算让我们一起演奏些什么，并和我们讨论演出的想法。”

"A show?" She exclaims, "Well you tell me the time and the place and I'll be there! Do you know what it'll be?"  
“演出？”她惊呼道，“那你告诉我时间和地点，我一定到！你知道是什么类型的演出吗？”

I shake my head, "No not yet. He seems to… like a lot of stuff when I spoke to him so it could be anything."  
我摇摇头，“还不清楚。他似乎……对很多东西都很感兴趣，所以可能是任何类型的。”

Misato closes the door behind her and I see her look around the room for a moment before taking hold of and pulling out the chair under my desk. I nervously set the bow back down on my bedside table as I watch her. Misato isn't just here to talk to me about the session today, she wants to talk to me about something else.  
美里关上她身后的门，我看到她环顾了一下房间，然后抓住并拉出了我桌子下的椅子。我紧张地把弓放回床头柜上，同时注视着她。美里不仅仅是来和我讨论今天的会话，她还想和我谈些别的。

"Actually…" She starts, "There is something else I wanted to talk to you about Shinji…"  
“实际上…”她开口道，“还有件事我想和你谈谈，真嗣…”

I brace myself for the discussion and to think about that name and person once again. I've been anticipating this for the last two weeks, ever since Rei told me that he was back. I've tried to not think about him and push him out of my mind so I can focus on the music but I knew Misato would want to speak to me eventually.  
我为即将到来的谈话做好了准备，并再次思考那个名字和那个人。自从绫波告诉我他回来了，这两周我一直在期待这一刻。我试图不去想他，把他从脑海中赶走，以便专注于音乐，但我知道美里迟早会想和我谈这件事。

"It's about Kaworu isn't it?" I ask her.  
"是关于渚薰的，对吧？" 我问她。

Misato merely nods, "Yeah… What did Rei tell you about him?"  
美里只是点点头，"嗯……绫波丽跟你说了他什么？"

"That he came back earlier in the year and that she saw him in Germany. She didn't… I didn't react well to it I guess so she didn't say more than that."  
"她说他今年早些时候回来了，她在德国见过他。她没……我猜我对这消息反应不太好，所以她没再多说什么。"

Misato gives me a concerned look when I tell her I didn't react well to Rei's news. I try to ease her worries, "It's fine though I… it was a big shock. I hadn't… thought about him in some time and it brought everything back."  
当我告诉美里我对绫波的消息反应不佳时，她投来了关切的目光。我试图缓解她的担忧，“不过没事，我……这消息太震撼了。我已经有段时间……没想过他了，这让我回忆起了所有。”

Misato averts her eyes from me. After I had… done what I had to do to Kaworu Misato was the first person on the scene. She was the first person to see it and tried to keep me away from it. She tried to make me feel better about it but that was an impossible task at that point. It'd be impossible now, how do you make someone feel better when they're forced to kill what they thought was a friend?  
美里避开了我的视线。在我……不得不对渚薰采取行动后，美里是第一个赶到现场的人。她是第一个目睹这一切的人，并试图让我远离那一切。她努力让我感觉好些，但在那时这是不可能的任务。现在也一样，当一个人被迫杀死他们认为是朋友的人时，你如何让他们感觉好些呢？

"So it's… true then… he is actually alive?"  
“所以……这是真的……他还活着？”

She nods, "Yes… Yes he is."  
她点头，“是的……是的，他是。”

Immediately on her saying that I feel my face heat up followed by a churning in my stomach. I immediately start to focus on my breathing like I've been told to, the feeling doesn't fade but it also doesn't worsen, "How… I don't understand."  
她一说完，我立刻感到脸颊发热，接着胃里一阵翻腾。我立刻开始专注于呼吸，就像别人告诉我的那样，这种感觉没有消退，但也没有加剧，“怎么会……我不明白。”

"We don't know either Shinji, I've tried to find out what I can but we don't know how or why he came back. They said that he is human now though…"  
“我们也不清楚，真嗣，我试图找出我能了解的信息，但我们不知道他是怎么回来的，也不知道为什么。不过他们说，他现在已经是人类了……”

"Kaworu is… human…" I repeat her words and think about what that might mean.  
"渚薰他…是人…" 我重复她的话，思考着这可能意味着什么。

"Yeah… So… We're all safe from him I guess. I just… I wanted to talk to you about him and find out how you feel about it. I just… couldn't find the right time."  
"是啊…所以…我想我们都不用再担心他了。我只是…想和你谈谈他，了解你的感受。我只是…找不到合适的时机。"

"I don't know how I feel." I answer her truthfully, "I… I can just remember those few days Misato… I can remember everything about it and…"  
"我不知道我的感受。" 我如实回答她，"我…我只记得那几天美里…我记得关于那一切的点点滴滴…"

"I know Shinji…" "我知道，真嗣……"

"I know I had to do it but… I killed someone Misato."  
"我知道我不得不这么做，但是……我杀了人，美里。"

"He was an Angel Shinji, you had no choice."  
"他是使徒，真嗣，你别无选择。"

"He was a person as well!" I snap back at her, "Sorry."  
"他也是个人啊！" 我回呛她，"抱歉。"

She shakes her head, "No, it's fine. This is a difficult subject for this time of night… I should have picked a better time."  
她摇摇头，"没事，这话题确实不适合深夜聊……我应该选个更合适的时间。"

Misato starts to stand up, "Wait! It's… There isn't a better time."  
美里开始站起来，"等等！其实……没有比现在更好的时机了。"

She sits back down and I continue to speak, "I... I just don't know how I feel about it. I try to not think about Kaworu it was just… too much. I know I had to do it but that doesn't stop me feeling guilty about it. I always wondered if I could have done more or tried to find another way."  
她重新坐下，我继续说道，“我……我只是不知道自己对此有何感受。我尽量不去想卡洛，那只是……太多了。我知道我必须这么做，但这并没有阻止我为此感到内疚。我总是在想，我是否本可以做得更多，或者尝试找到另一种方法。”

She leans forward and puts a comforting hand on my knee, "You did what you had to do Shinji. You did what he wanted you to do."  
她向前倾身，安慰地把手放在我的膝盖上，“你做了你必须做的事，真嗣。你做了他希望你做的事。”

"I know." I shake my head, "I know that but I still wonder if it could have been different. Now that he's back I don't know if I should be happy that he somehow survived or angry about it. I don't know if I should hate him or not. I… I'm sorry, I know I make this difficult."  
“我知道。”我摇摇头，“我知道这一点，但我仍然想知道是否可能有所不同。现在他回来了，我不知道我应该因为他奇迹般地生还而高兴，还是对此感到愤怒。我不知道我是否应该恨他。我……对不起，我知道这让事情变得复杂。”

"Shinji you aren't making anything difficult." Misato pauses, "It isn't… easy to talk about this sort of thing or even think about it especially when it is still so fresh. You don't need to have all those answers now, you don't need to have them soon or at all. Just… I just want you to know what if you need anything at all or to talk I'm here for you."  
"真嗣，你并没有让事情变得复杂。" 美里停顿了一下，"谈论这种事情……或者甚至去想它，都不容易，尤其是当它还那么新鲜。你现在不需要有所有答案，不久后也不需要，甚至永远不需要。只是……我只是想让你知道，如果你需要任何帮助或者想谈谈，我都在这里。"

"I know, thank you Misato."  
"我知道，谢谢你，美里。"

Misato gets up off of the seat and hugs me, "I'm sorry you have to go through this."  
美里从座位上站起来，拥抱了我，"我很抱歉你不得不经历这些。"

I hug her back, "It isn't your fault."  
我回抱她，“这不是你的错。”

She breaks the hug, "I'm going to go to bed now Shinji. I have a meeting early tomorrow morning. I love you."  
她松开拥抱，“我要去睡觉了，真嗣。明天一早还有个会。我爱你。”

"I love you too Misato." She hugs me one more time and starts to exit the room. Just as she leaves I stop her, "Misato… What if I wanted to see him?"  
“我也爱你，美里。”她再次拥抱了我，然后准备离开房间。就在她即将离开时，我叫住了她，“美里……如果我想见他呢？”

She frowns for a brief moment, "Then… Maybe it could be arranged but he would have to agree to it as well. Why… What would you say to him?"  
她皱眉片刻，"那么…或许可以安排，但他也必须同意。为什么…你会对他说什么呢？"

"I don't know I guess… I'd ask him why he did what he did."  
"我不知道，我想…我会问他为什么那样做。"

"I understand, goodnight Shinji."  
"我明白了，晚安，真嗣。"

"Goodnight Misato." “晚安，美里。”

Misato gives me one final hug and I watch as she leaves the room and me alone with my thoughts about Kaworu. It's strange and maybe stupid of me but I've never been able to bring myself to hate him for what he did.  
美里给了我最后一个拥抱，我看着她离开房间，留下我独自面对关于渚的思绪。这很奇怪，也许很愚蠢，但我始终无法让自己恨他，因为他所做的一切。

I was definitely angry with him at first. He was the only person, the only friend I had at that time and it felt like he took advantage of that. He betrayed me and the trust I put in him but I can't hate him because I guess I just want to know why he did it. I know why my father did what he did and I do hate him for that. I know why others acted the way they did too and I've come to terms with most of it.  
起初，我确实对他感到愤怒。他是当时我唯一的一个人，唯一的朋友，感觉他利用了这一点。他背叛了我，辜负了我的信任，但我无法恨他，因为我只是想知道他为什么这么做。我知道我父亲为什么那样做，我确实因此恨他。我也知道其他人为什么那样行动，我已经接受了其中的大部分。

Kaworu… I never had an explanation for it. He was an Angel, the last one but why was he an Angel? Why did he have to do what he did? I know about SEELE and that he was sent by them so did he know what he had to do? Kaworu tried to tell me something when it happened but I didn't understand at the time. He spoke about humanity going on and living and how he had to die but I don't understand why. Why did he have to die and why did I have to be the one to kill him?  
渚薰……我从未得到过解释。他是使徒，最后一个，但为什么他是使徒？他为何必须做那些事？我知道 SEELE 和他被他们派遣，那么他是否知道自己必须做什么？渚薰在那时试图告诉我些什么，但我当时并不理解。他谈及人类继续生存，以及他必须死去，但我无法理解为何如此。为何他必须死，为何我必须成为那个杀他的人？

Maybe if I had the answer to that I could hate him or maybe I could forgive him. I don't know and I don't know what Misato and Rei would think of it either. I suppose they think I should hate Kaworu for what he was and what he did. After all he did hurt me, I'm aware of that, he hurt me so much and yet I just can't hate him.  
或许如果我知道答案，我就能恨他，或者也许能原谅他。我不清楚，也不知道美里和绫波会怎么想。我想他们认为我应该因为他的身份和所做的事而恨他。毕竟他确实伤害了我，我清楚这一点，他深深地伤害了我，然而我就是无法恨他。

I'm scared of him though. As stupid as that sounds and I can definitely hear that voice again telling me I'm stupid for being scared. I am though because I always wondered if maybe I could have done more to save him and what if he hates me for that.  
尽管这听起来很愚蠢，但我确实害怕他。我肯定能再次听到那个声音，告诉我害怕他是愚蠢的。然而我确实害怕，因为我一直在想，也许我本可以做更多来救他，如果他因此恨我怎么办。

I shake my head and get up off of my bed to put my pyjamas on. I try to push these thoughts out of my head for now. Kaworu can wait, these thoughts won't ruin what has been a good day.  
我摇了摇头，从床上起身穿上睡衣。我试图暂时把这些念头抛诸脑后。Kaworu 可以等一等，这些思绪不会毁掉这美好的一天。

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

I find myself following silently behind Kaworu as I enter his apartment again and once more look over the neatly set out dining table. With quite a lot of shame and embarrassment I sit myself down and try to not focus on Kaworu as he goes back into his kitchen to start preparing the meal. He gets to the fridge and smiles sheepishly at me, "I… asked before but what sort of wine would you like? I… Well as I said I'm a bit unsure as to which would have been appropriate so bought more than I probably needed to."  
我默默地跟在 Kaworu 身后走进他的公寓，再次环顾那张布置得井井有条的餐桌。我带着羞愧和尴尬坐下，尽量不去关注 Kaworu 回到厨房开始准备晚餐。他走到冰箱前，腼腆地对我笑了笑，“我……之前问过，但你想喝什么酒？我……正如我所说，我不太确定哪种合适，所以可能买得有点多了。”

For a brief moment I consider just asking him to bring everything he has over. Maybe I can get myself so drunk I'll pass out and forget all about the last two weeks. The more sensible side of me asks him to bring out a simple French white wine. Truth is I can't really answer his question, I likely know as much about wine as he does. I know French whites are supposed to be nice though.  
有那么一瞬间，我考虑让他把所有的酒都拿过来。也许我可以把自己灌醉到昏睡过去，忘记过去两周的一切。但理智的一面让我请他拿出一瓶简单的法国白葡萄酒。说实话，我无法真正回答他的问题，我对葡萄酒的了解可能和他差不多。不过我知道法国白葡萄酒应该不错。

He takes the bottle out of his fridge and opens it before bringing it over to where I'm sat. I avert my gaze as he fills up two wine glasses. I take the now filled glass and sip at the substance, it tastes nice enough I guess. I give him a smile and go back to thinking about how shamefully I've acted since getting here. I hate myself for not being able to keep it together and running away like that.  
他从冰箱里拿出瓶子，打开后走到我坐的地方。我避开目光，看着他倒满两杯葡萄酒。我接过已倒满的杯子，轻啜一口，味道还算不错。我对他微笑，然后继续思考自从来到这里后自己多么可耻的行为。我讨厌自己无法保持冷静，像那样逃跑。

It would be one thing to have just not come here or to have gotten upset like I did earlier today. That was fine because I was alone. I wasn't alone when I did that, Kaworu witnessed it and I can only imagine what he thinks of me now. Not only that but he actually stepped forward and hugged me. He held me and as nice as that was, as much as I longed for it, it has not helped me figure out these feelings.  
如果只是没来这里，或者像今天早些时候那样独自难过，那还好。当时我一个人，但逃跑时我不是一个人，渚薰目睹了这一切，我只能想象他现在对我的看法。不仅如此，他还真的走上前来拥抱了我。他抱着我，尽管那感觉很好，尽管我渴望那样，但这并没有帮助我理清这些情感。

"Do you feel better now Asuka?" Kaworu asks me as he moved back into the kitchen.  
“你现在感觉好些了吗，明日香？”渚薰问我，同时走回厨房。

I nod my head, "A little bit. I'm sorry, it's just… been a rough couple of days and with my book nearly finished I have a lot to do and think about, just… a lot of things…"  
我点点头，“有一点。对不起，只是……这几天挺难熬的，而且我的书快写完了，有很多事情要做，很多东西要想，就是……很多事情……”

"It must be a stressful time for you." He talks to me over the sounds of a pan starting to heat up, "How do you like your steak?"  
“对你来说一定很紧张吧。”他在平底锅开始加热的声音中对我说，“你喜欢牛排怎么做？”

"Rare." I reply. “三分熟。”我回答道。

Kaworu says nothing further as he continues to work in the kitchen. I watch him as he goes between cooking the steaks and sorting out the rest of the meal. I have to admit the smells coming from the kitchen are very appetising. I feel my stomach growl again in anticipation as he finishes setting everything out and brings a plate over to me. I can feel my mouth start to water at the sight of the food. The steak looks great, seemingly cooked just as I like it. The sauce, a peppercorn is drizzled lightly over the steak and the vegetables are also appealing.  
Kaworu 没有再多说什么，继续在厨房忙碌。我看着他在烹饪牛排和准备其他菜肴之间来回穿梭。不得不承认，从厨房飘出的香味非常诱人。我感到肚子再次咕咕作响，期待着他将所有食物摆好并端了一盘给我。看到食物的那一刻，我几乎要流口水了。牛排看起来棒极了，似乎正是我喜欢的熟度。黑胡椒酱轻轻淋在牛排上，蔬菜也同样吸引人。

I wait for Kaworu to sit himself down before taking hold of my knife and fork and cutting into my steak. I make sure I get a good portion and take some of the sauce with it. I try to ignore his expectant gaze as I chew through it and finally swallow. I normally dislike anyone watching me eat but I'll let him off just this once seeing as I can only imagine his nerves right now.  
我等 Kaworu 坐下后，才拿起刀叉切开我的牛排。我确保切下一大块并带上一些酱汁。我尽量忽视他期待的目光，咀嚼并最终咽下。通常我不喜欢别人看我吃饭，但看在他现在可能紧张的份上，这次就放过他吧。

I've barely finished the mouthful before he asks my opinion, "Was it… to your liking?"  
我刚咽下那口食物，他就询问我的意见，“你觉得……合口味吗？”

I nod at him, "It is delicious."  
我朝他点点头，“非常美味。”

"Thank you." I see some of the tenseness in his body leave as he also breathes a sigh of relief, "I was hoping that you would like it."  
“谢谢。”我看到他身体里的紧张感消散了一些，他也松了口气，“我本来就希望你会喜欢。”

Kaworu now starts to eat and the two of us sit there in a comfortable silence enjoying this meal that he has prepared. Neither of us speak during the course of it but every now and then we glance and catch each other's eye. We sip our wine and smile at one another.  
渚薰开始用餐，我们俩舒适地坐在那里，享受着他准备的这顿饭。用餐过程中我们都没有说话，但时不时地会互相瞥一眼，相视一笑。我们品着红酒，彼此微笑。

I'm the first one to finish both my plate and also my first glass of wine. I put my knife and fork down on the plate in satisfaction, "That was really nice Kaworu, I didn't know you were so capable."  
我是第一个吃完盘子里的食物并喝完第一杯酒的人。我满意地将刀叉放在盘子上，说：“这真的很棒，Kaworu，我没想到你这么能干。”

Kaworu laughs, "I am still… learning and there have been many accidents along the way but I am improving. It pleases me that it was to your liking."  
Kaworu 笑了，“我还在……学习中，一路上有很多意外，但我正在进步。很高兴你喜欢。”

"It really was." I reply as Kaworu also finishes up what is left on his plate and sets his cutlery down. We fall into silence again but this time it's also accompanied once more by the thoughts of how I acted previously. I know I hurt him when I did that and he deserves an explanation for it. I wasn't going to talk about it tonight but maybe I should.  
“确实很棒。”我回答道，Kaworu 也吃完了他盘子里剩下的食物，放下餐具。我们再次陷入沉默，但这次还伴随着我之前行为的思考。我知道我那样做伤害了他，他应该得到一个解释。我本不打算今晚谈论这件事，但也许我应该。

Maybe that would ruin the night though. I've already nearly done that by walking out, I don't want to do it again by bringing up that subject. If I don't now though then when will I? I might not have this chance again. That thing Kaworu did earlier for me, saying he wasn't afraid of me and just hugging me, he has no idea how much that means to me. I can trust Kaworu, not only that but those things I feel… maybe I'm justified in feeling them so I have to tell him.  
也许那样会毁了今晚。我已经差点因为走出去而搞砸了，我不想再因为提起那个话题而重蹈覆辙。但如果我现在不说，那我什么时候说呢？我可能不会再有这样的机会了。碇真嗣之前为我做的事，说他不怕我，只是拥抱我，他不知道那对我意味着什么。我可以信任碇真嗣，不仅如此，那些我感觉到的……也许我感受到它们是有道理的，所以我必须告诉他。

"Kaworu… I am… I'm sorry about what happened earlier. It is not just the book that is bothering me. It's… something else. Something happened earlier today and you have a right to know."  
“碇真嗣……我……我对之前发生的事感到抱歉。不仅仅是因为那本书让我心烦。是……别的事情。今天早些时候发生了一些事，你有权知道。”

"You do not need to apologize Asuka, I understand."  
“你不需要道歉，明日香，我理解。”

"No." I shake my head at him, "You don't understand, at least… you think you do. Earlier today I wrote an e-mail, a lengthy e-mail talking about a lot of things. I was going to send it to Shinji."  
"不。" 我对他摇头，"你不明白，至少……你以为你懂。今天早些时候我写了一封电子邮件，一封长长的邮件，谈了很多事情。我原本打算发给真嗣。"

"Oh… I see." I look up just in time to see Kaworu sag his shoulders and lower his eyes, "I understand."  
"哦……我明白了。" 我抬头正好看到薰垂下肩膀，垂下眼帘，"我懂了。"

"I don't know why I wrote it, I just… I guess since you arrived I've been thinking about certain things and maybe I felt it was time to get back in contact with them. In it I was going to tell them everything, why I left the way I did and why I've had no contact. I was going to tell them about being friends with Rei and explain that to them and I was also going to tell them about my meeting you."  
"我不知道为什么我会写那封信，我只是……我想自从你来了之后，我一直在思考一些事情，也许我觉得是时候重新联系他们了。在信中，我打算告诉他们一切，我为什么那样离开，为什么一直没联系。我打算告诉他们我和绫波成为朋友的事，并向他们解释，我还打算告诉他们我遇见你的事。"

"Why could you not send it?" Kaworu asks me after a pause.  
“为什么你不能发送呢？” Kaworu 在停顿后问我。

I shrug my shoulders, "I don't know… I just couldn't. I read through it a few times and it seemed fine but I could couldn't bring myself to click send. I guess…"  
我耸耸肩，“我不知道……我就是做不到。我读了几遍，似乎没问题，但我就是无法让自己点击发送。我想……”

I let out a sigh, "I'm an idiot, I guess all my life I wanted independence and to prove I could do things on my own but when it comes to something like this I want approval first. I wanted to tell Rei and… I wanted to tell you about it first."  
我叹了口气，“我想我是个傻瓜，我一生都渴望独立，证明我能自己做事，但当涉及到这样的事情时，我首先想要得到认可。我想告诉 Rei 和……我想先告诉你这件事。”

I shake my head, "Damn thing involves you so I guess it was only right you were told just in case something happened. Not that it would, I'd make sure of that."  
我摇了摇头，“这破事儿牵扯到你，所以我想还是得告诉你，万一出什么事。不过不会的，我会确保没事的。”

"Yeah…" “是啊……”

"Anyway I… I tried to phone Rei this afternoon but it wasn't her who answered the phone. It was Shinji…"  
“话说回来，我……我今天下午试着给丽打电话，但接电话的不是她，是真嗣……”

Kaworu snaps to attention on hearing me say that. His eyes are locked firmly on me and I can see that same terrified look on his face that he had when I first met him, "You… You spoke to him?"  
听到我这么说，渚薰立刻警觉起来。他的目光紧紧锁定在我身上，我看到他脸上那初次见面时的惊恐表情，“你……你和他通话了？”

"No. No I didn't." I shake my head again and smile, "I heard his voice and I kept silent. Eventually I just hung up and then not long afterwards you called me to arrange this."  
“没有，我没有。”我再次摇头微笑，“我听到了他的声音，但我保持沉默。最终我只是挂断了电话，不久之后你就打给我安排这次见面。”

"So that is the reason you did not seem alright on the phone?" Kaworu asks me.  
“所以这就是你在电话里显得不太对劲的原因？”渚薰问我。

"Exactly." I admit, "It put me in something of a bad place. Maybe I should have told you this on the phone, it might have made things easier. When I came here tonight I still felt awful and… what you had done was so nice it just overwhelmed me. I'm sorry I ruined it, you must have spent a lot of time planning it and I've not exactly been the guest you anticipated."  
“确实。”我承认道，“这让我陷入了某种困境。也许我本该在电话里告诉你，那样可能会让事情简单些。今晚我来这里时，心情依然很糟，而你所做的一切是如此美好，以至于让我感到不知所措。对不起，我搞砸了，你一定花了很多时间来策划这一切，而我显然不是你预期的那位客人。”

I feel my shoulders sag as I wait for him to reply. In a strange way I do feel better now for having told him about all of this. I glance back down at the table hoping that he'll say something soon, it'll make the rest of this night easier.  
我感到肩膀下垂，等待他的回复。奇怪的是，把这些都告诉他之后，我感觉好多了。我再次瞥向桌子，希望他能尽快说些什么，这样今晚剩下的时间会容易些。

**Misato Katsuragi 葛城美里**

I slide Shinji's door shut behind me and let out a sigh when I'm back in the middle of the room. I honestly don't know what I was expecting Shinji to say when I spoke to him about Nagisa but on the top of that list was the idea of meeting with him. I know Shinji didn't directly ask about it and maybe he won't but I certainly didn't think about the possibility.  
我轻轻关上真嗣的门，回到房间中央时叹了口气。老实说，我不知道当我向真嗣提起渚时，我期待他会说什么，但其中最不希望的就是与他见面。我知道真嗣并没有直接提到这件事，也许他不会提，但我确实没有考虑过这种可能性。

One thing I do know is that I cannot allow a meeting between those two to happen. I can't allow for Nagisa to hurt Shinji again like he did so many years ago. I'm not just Shinji's guardian anymore, I'm now his mother, I am now his family and I swore to protect him. I don't want to hurt him or deny him anything but this… This I feel I have to deny him if I have to.  
有一点我很清楚，那就是我不能让那两个人见面。我不能让渚再次像多年前那样伤害真嗣。我不再是真嗣的监护人，现在我是他的母亲，我是他的家人，我发誓要保护他。我不想伤害他或拒绝他任何事情，但这件事……这件事我觉得我必须拒绝他，如果必须的话。

Since learning about Nagisa's return I have been making an attempt to find out what I can about him. I've heard very little from Fuyutsuki about the boy which I suppose is a good thing. There was mention of an incident two weeks ago which resulted in two members of security being removed but the details aren't known to me.  
自从得知渚的归来，我一直在努力了解他的情况。我从冬月那里听到的关于那孩子的消息很少，我想这算是件好事。两周前发生了一起事件，导致两名保安人员被撤换，但具体细节我不清楚。

Despite there not being any major incident I still have this bad feeling in the pit of my stomach about the situation. I've been reassured that Nagisa poses no threat but I just don't think I'll be able to see it that way. I know what he was and I know how dangerous he was.  
尽管没有发生什么重大事件，但我对这种情况仍有一种不好的预感。我被保证说渚没有威胁，但我就是无法这样看待。我知道他过去是什么样的人，也知道他有多危险。

Nagisa wasn't just an Angel. He was an Angel that came to us in human form. He was an Angel that managed to get into NERV and manipulated Shinji before tearing the poor kid apart. He worked with the true enemy in SEELE to get himself into that organization and do what he did. He was aware of everything he was doing.  
渚薰不仅仅是一个天使。他是以人类形态来到我们身边的天使。他设法进入了 NERV，并在撕裂可怜的碇真嗣之前操纵了他。他与真正的敌人 SEELE 合作，让自己进入那个组织并实施了他的计划。他清楚自己所做的一切。

I can still remember the horrific scenes I witnessed when I went down after Shinji had to kill him. I was the first one on the scene and I had to pull Shinji out of the entry plug. I held him as he vomited into the lake of LCL upon witnessing it all himself. I heard Shinji speak as he blamed himself and said that he should have been the one to die instead of Kaworu.  
我至今仍记得当我下去时目睹的可怕场景，那是真嗣不得不杀死他之后。我是第一个到达现场的人，我不得不把真嗣从插入栓中拉出来。我抱着他，他亲眼目睹一切后在 LCL 湖中呕吐。我听到真嗣自责地说，他本应该死去，而不是代替铃原。

Maybe I should take some of the blame for how broken Shinji was back then too. Maybe I should have done more in the months before to help him… No, not maybe. I should have done a hell of a lot more to help him, I failed both Shinji and Asuka back then. I made no effort to understand them nor help them. I was content to use them as tools to aid my own personal crusade.  
也许我也应该为当时真嗣的崩溃承担一些责任。也许在那之前的几个月里，我应该做得更多来帮助他……不，不是也许。我本应该做更多来帮助他，我那时辜负了真嗣和明日香。我没有努力去理解他们，也没有帮助他们。我满足于将他们作为工具来支持我个人的十字军行动。

In many ways I was no better than his father. I drank myself to excess to forget it all back then and make jokes and acted like a fool. I've tried to change that now though, I've tried desperately to rectify it. Asuka… Well she went away and we haven't heard from her in years, I failed her but with Shinji… I won't let myself fail him. I can't let Shinji be hurt like that again, I have to help him and protect him. I won't let Nagisa hurt him.  
在很多方面，我并不比他的父亲强。那时我酗酒过度，以此忘却一切，说着笑话，表现得像个傻瓜。但现在我努力改变，拼命想要弥补。明日香……她离开了，多年来杳无音讯，我辜负了她，但对真嗣……我不能再让他失望。我不能让真嗣再次受到那样的伤害，我必须帮助他、保护他。我不会让渚再伤害他。

As I sit myself down on the sofa I look towards the hallway at the other closed door there, the one belonging to Rei. I realize that ever since I picked her up from the airport I haven't really had the time to speak to her about this either. Even worse I left it up to her to tell Shinji about Nagisa coming back. For all my promises I can't help but feel I'm not doing a good job of this parenting thing.  
当我坐到沙发上，目光投向走廊另一端的紧闭的门，那是属于绫波的房间。我意识到，自从从机场接她回来后，我还没真正有时间和她谈这件事。更糟糕的是，我让她自己去告诉真嗣渚回来的消息。尽管我许下了承诺，但我还是忍不住觉得自己在育儿这件事上做得不够好。

I get up from my seat and make my way over to the door and slide it open. I'm about to stick my head in and say something when I hear her talking to someone.  
我从座位上起身，走向那扇门并轻轻拉开。正当我准备探头进去说些什么时，我听到她在和某人说话。

"… I hope you are alright, please call me when you get this message. I will talk to you soon."  
“…希望你一切安好，收到这条消息后请给我回电。我们很快再聊。”

Rei hands up the phone and I announce myself, "Rei?"  
丽挂断电话，我自报家门，“丽？”

She jumps in fright at the sound of my voice, "Is everything alright?"  
她被我的声音吓了一跳，“一切都好吗？”

Rei puts her phone down and sits herself at the edge of her bed, "It is fine, I was just trying to contact a friend."  
丽放下手机，坐在床边，“没事，我只是想联系一个朋友。”

"Oh?" I can't help but feel a little smile creep onto my lips. Judging by her reaction I wonder if maybe this friend was a bit more. Whilst I do my best to not tease either of them about their lives of friends but occasionally I do feel that urge, "Was it a… special friend perhaps?"  
“哦？”我不禁感到一丝微笑爬上嘴角。从她的反应来看，我猜想这位朋友可能不止于此。虽然我尽力不去调侃他们的朋友生活，但偶尔还是会有那种冲动，“或许是……特别的朋友？”

Rei, unlike Shinji, is pretty much impervious to any of my teasing and shrugs it off, "No, it was just a friend I made whilst I was travelling. They have been unwell recently and I was concerned about them."  
丽不像真嗣，她对我的调侃几乎免疫，轻松地耸了耸肩，“不，只是旅行时认识的朋友。他们最近身体不适，我有点担心。”

"Oh! That's very nice of you Rei." I respond, "It's nice to see you making friends in your travels, maybe one day we can meet them."  
"哦！丽，你真是太好了。" 我回应道，"很高兴看到你在旅途中结交朋友，也许有一天我们能见到他们。"

"I do not know if that would be likely given the circumstances, but it would be nice." Rei replies, "Is there something troubling you?"  
"考虑到目前的状况，这可能不太现实，但确实很美好。" 丽回答，"你有什么烦心事吗？"

As Rei speaks I notice her gaze shift ever so slightly away from me. I sense that there is possibly something more to her 'friend than she is actually willing to tell me. It's funny but despite her being impervious to my teasing, unlike Shinji, she does share other traits with Shinji. If there is something bothering the two of them they each have this little way of averting their gaze and having a certain expression that gives them away.  
当丽说话时，我注意到她的目光微微从我身上移开。我感觉到她口中的'朋友'可能还有更多她不愿告诉我的事情。有趣的是，尽管她不像真嗣那样容易被我逗乐，但她确实和真嗣有其他相似之处。如果他们俩有什么困扰，他们各自都有这种小动作——转移视线并带着某种表情，这让他们露出了破绽。

I wonder for a moment if maybe I should pursue the subject further but figure it best not to for the moment. I don't want to seem too overbearing when it comes to Rei, I want to be there for her but I also want to give her the space to figure things out. Also, unlike Shinji, if something is bothering Rei she will generally speak to me first. It's a situation that has led to some interesting conversations, ones that have even made me blush.  
我一时好奇是否该继续探究这个话题，但觉得眼下最好还是不要。在丽的事情上，我不想显得过于强势，我希望能陪伴她，同时也给她空间去理清思绪。而且，与真嗣不同，如果丽有什么困扰，她通常会先来找我倾诉。这种情况曾引发过一些有趣的对话，甚至让我脸红。

"You could say that." I answer her, "I spoke to Shinji a moment ago about the Nagisa thing."  
“可以这么说。”我回答她，“刚才我和真嗣谈了谈渚的事情。”

"I see, how was he?"  
“这样啊，他怎么样？”

"He seemed alright but he… said something that worried me I guess. It's probably nothing to worry about though. I just… I wanted to see how you were doing as well I suppose, I realized I haven't really spoken to you about it either."  
"他看起来还好，但他……说了些让我担心的话，我想。不过可能没什么好担心的。我只是……我也想看看你怎么样了，我想我还没真正和你谈过这件事。"

Rei nods, "I am fine with it as long as Nagisa does not attempt to make contact with my brother. If he stays away from us and does not cause any problems then I see no reason to worry about him. What did Shinji say that worried you?"  
丽点点头，"只要渚不试图联系我哥哥，我可以接受。如果他远离我们，不惹麻烦，那我就没有理由担心他。真嗣说了什么让你担心的话？"

"He asked me what would happen if he wanted to meet Nagisa." I answer her truthfully. Straight away I see a scowl from on her face. In some strange way it comforts me that she seems to share my views on Nagisa. I know from our discussion a few weeks ago she doesn't view him favourably and what she has just said also confirms that she sees Nagisa the same way I do, as a threat.  
"他问我如果他想见渚会发生什么。" 我如实回答她。我立刻看到她脸上露出了不悦的表情。从某种奇怪的角度来说，这让我感到安慰，因为她似乎和我一样对渚有看法。我知道几周前我们的讨论中她对他并不看好，她刚才的话也证实了她和我一样，把渚视为威胁。

"I do not believe that would be a wise decision." She finally says.  
"我认为那不是明智的决定。" 她终于说道。

I nod my head, "Yes, I agree."  
我点头，"是的，我同意。"

"Did Shinji say why he might desire this?"  
"真嗣有说他为什么想要这样做吗？"

"Not really, said he wanted to know why Nagisa did what he did. You know what Shinji is like though, I don't think he sees Nagisa in the same light we do. I think he might still see himself as being the one at fault."  
“并不完全是，他说他想知道渚为什么要那么做。不过你知道真嗣的脾气，我觉得他看待渚的眼光和我们不一样。他可能还是认为自己才是有错的那一方。”

"That is certainly a possibility." Rei nods, "I do not believe my brother has ever been able to confront that particular time in his life. It was not a pleasant time for any of us to come to terms with."  
“这确实有可能。”绫波点头道，“我哥哥从未能直面那段人生中的特殊时期。对我们任何人来说，那都不是一段容易接受的经历。”

She lowers her head, "Nagisa… for all he was and all he did was something of a source of light for Shinji and it is hard for him to extinguish that."  
她低下头，“渚……无论他是什么样的人，做了什么，对真嗣来说都是一束光，要他熄灭这束光很难。”

"Nagisa was the enemy." I state flatly knowing that Rei is right. When Shinji was with Nagisa he actually seemed happy. Nagisa's interactions with him seemed genuine and I know Nagisa did bring Shinji some fleeting happiness which was so valuable back then.  
"“渚是敌人。”我直截了当地说，知道零是对的。当真嗣和渚在一起时，他看起来真的很快乐。渚与他之间的互动显得真诚，我知道渚确实给真嗣带来了短暂的快乐，这在当时是如此珍贵。”

"I know that and it would be my desire that Nagisa does not have any contact with my brother." Rei says coldly before pausing, "Yet, I would also not wish to stand in Shinji's way should he desire contact again."  
“我知道，我也希望渚不要再和我弟弟有任何接触。”零冷冷地说，然后停顿了一下，“然而，如果真嗣再次渴望与渚接触，我也不希望成为他的阻碍。”

"Even if it could hurt him?" I ask, somewhat confused by what Rei has said.  
"“即使这可能会伤害他？”我问道，对零的话感到有些困惑。”

"If my brother were to be hurt by Nagisa he would have me to answer to. I would be sure to warn Nagisa of this before contact is made."  
"如果我的弟弟被渚伤害了，他得向我交代。我会在他们接触之前警告渚这一点。"

"So if Shinji did ask, you think I should let him?"  
"所以如果真嗣真的问了，你觉得我应该答应他吗？"

Rei nods, "It is against what I believe and what you believe but it is not for us to make that decision. Shinji must be able to figure it out for himself and I think blocking him would hurt him more."  
绫波点头，“这与我所信奉的以及你所信奉的相悖，但那不是我们能决定的。真嗣必须自己想清楚，我认为阻止他只会对他伤害更大。”

I feel a smile spread as I listen to Rei speak, it's strange but despite her only having been completely human for a few years she has grown so much in that short space of time. She has matured so much and can provide good insight when needed. So many times when I speak to her I forget that I am supposed to be the adult.  
听着丽说话，我感到笑容在脸上蔓延开来。虽然她成为完全的人类才不过几年，但在这短短的时间里，她已经成长了许多。她变得成熟，必要时能提供深刻的见解。很多时候，和她交谈时，我都会忘记自己应该是那个成年人。

Yet I am still concerned about this whole thing and I can tell from the frown on her face that she is too.  
然而，我对这一切仍然感到担忧，从她皱眉的表情中，我可以看出她也有同样的感受。

"I still don't know Rei… but you are right, I… can't control what Shinji does and he has to make his own mind up on these things. I don't want to push him to do anything he doesn't want to and I don't want to stop him doing things he wants to… within reason of course."  
“我还是不太明白，丽……但你是对的，我……无法控制真嗣的行为，他必须自己决定这些事情。我不想强迫他做任何他不愿意做的事，也不想阻止他做他想做的事……当然是在合理的范围内。”

"I understand and I promise…" Rei turns to look at me, "Should Shinji make that request and this happen, I will ensure Nagisa does not have the opportunity to hurt my brother again."  
"我明白，我承诺……" 丽转向我，"如果真嗣提出那个请求，事情变成这样，我会确保渚薰不会再有机会伤害我的弟弟。"

**Kaworu Nagisa. 渚薰。**

"No." I look at Asuka as she shakes her head, "You don't understand, at least… you think you do. Earlier today I wrote an e-mail, a lengthy e-mail talking about a lot of things. I was going to send it to Shinji."  
"不。" 我看向明日香，她摇着头说，"你不明白，至少……你以为你明白。今天早些时候我写了一封电子邮件，一封长邮件，谈了很多事情。我本来打算发给真嗣的。"

"Oh… I see." I try to hide the disappointment I'm feeling at hearing her say those words but I do a poor job of it. I can feel my shoulders lower and my gaze go to the table as I mumble out a reply, "I understand."  
"哦… 我明白了。" 我试图掩饰听到她那番话后的失望，但做得并不好。我能感觉到自己的肩膀下垂，目光转向桌子，喃喃地回答，"我懂了。"

"I don't know why I wrote it, I just… I guess since you arrived I've been thinking about certain things and maybe I felt it was time to get back in contact with them. In it I was going to tell them everything, why I left the way I did and why I've had no contact. I was going to tell them about being friends with Rei and explain that to them and I was also going to tell them about my meeting you."  
"我不知道为什么写这封信，我只是… 自从你来了之后，我一直在想一些事情，也许我觉得是时候重新联系他们了。在信里，我打算告诉他们一切，我为什么那样离开，为什么一直没联系。我打算告诉他们我和丽成为朋友的事，并向他们解释，我还要告诉他们遇见你的事。"

I pause as I process what she is saying. I suppose that perhaps I should have expected this event to eventually take place. I am not ignorant to her feelings for Shinji nor am I ignorant of his feelings for her. When I spent time with Shinji so long ago he would speak of Asuka fondly and told me he was scared of what would happen to her.  
我停顿了一下，思考她的话。我想也许我本该预料到这件事终会发生。我对她对真嗣的感情并不无知，对真嗣对她的感情也一样。很久以前我和真嗣相处时，他会深情地谈起明日香，并告诉我他害怕她会发生什么。

When Asuka has spoken to me of Shinji I can see the emotion in her eyes. I can't sense the feelings in her heart but I know they are there. I have always known and yet I still feel this strange sensation of disappointment within me. I feel this tightening in my chest and lump in my throat.  
当明日香向我谈起真嗣时，我能从她的眼中看到情感的流露。我虽无法感知她内心的感受，但我知道它们确实存在。我一直都知道，然而内心仍有一种莫名的失望感。胸口紧绷，喉咙哽咽。

Finally I am able to speak again, I try to sound as normal as possible, "Why could you not send it?"  
终于，我又能开口说话了，我尽量保持语气的平常，"为什么你没能发送出去？"

Asuka shrugs her shoulders, "I don't know… I just couldn't. I read through it a few times and it seemed fine but I could couldn't bring myself to click send. I guess…"  
明日香耸了耸肩，"我不知道……我就是做不到。我读了几遍，感觉没问题，但就是无法让自己点击发送。我想……"

She sighs, "I'm an idiot, I guess all my life I wanted independence and to prove I could do things on my own but when it comes to something like this I want approval first. I wanted to tell Rei and… I wanted to tell you about it first."  
她叹了口气，“我想我是个傻瓜，一直以来我都渴望独立，证明自己能独自完成事情，但遇到这种事时，我却首先想要得到认可。我想先告诉丽和……我想先告诉你。”

As strange as it sounds my heart lightens ever so slightly at hearing her say she wanted my approval first. I listen to her as she continues, "Damn thing involves you so I guess it was only right you were told just in case something happened. Not that it would, I'd make sure of that."  
虽然听起来很奇怪，但听到她说她首先想要我的认可，我的心稍稍轻松了一些。我听着她继续说，“这事儿牵扯到你，所以我想告诉你也是应该的，以防万一发生什么。不过不会的，我会确保那不会发生。”

"Yeah…" “是啊……”

"Anyway I… I tried to phone Rei this afternoon but it wasn't her who answered the phone. It was Shinji…"  
"总之我……我今天下午试着给丽打电话，但接电话的不是她。是真嗣……"

My head snaps upwards and I lock my eyes firmly onto Asuka on hearing her say that. That terrible feeling of fear creeps into me once again, "You… You spoke to him?"  
我猛地抬起头，目光坚定地锁定在明日香身上，听到她这么说。那种可怕的恐惧感再次悄悄侵袭我，“你……你跟他说话了吗？”

"No. No I didn't." Asuka shakes her head and I see a small smile come to her lips, "I heard his voice and I kept silent. Eventually I just hung up and then not long afterwards you called me to arrange this."  
"没有。我没有。" 明日香摇摇头，我看到她嘴角露出一丝微笑，"我听到他的声音就保持沉默了。最后我只是挂了电话，然后没过多久你就打电话给我安排这个了。"

"So that is the reason you did not seem alright on the phone?" I ask her.  
"所以这就是你电话里听起来不太对劲的原因？" 我问她。

"Exactly." She tells me, "It put me in something of a bad place. Maybe I should have told you this on the phone, it might have made things easier. When I came here tonight I still felt awful and… what you had done was so nice it just overwhelmed me. I'm sorry I ruined it, you must have spent a lot of time planning it and I've not exactly been the guest you anticipated."  
"正是。" 她告诉我，"这让我心情很糟糕。也许我本该在电话里告诉你，那样可能会让事情简单些。今晚我来这里时，仍然感觉很糟，而你所做的一切是那么贴心，让我完全无法承受。对不起，我搞砸了，你一定花了很多时间策划这一切，而我显然不是你预期的那位客人。"

I admit I am somewhat lost for words when she finishes speaking. I know I have to say something to her to reassure her. I need to tell her that just her being here and sharing a meal with me is more than enough for me to be happy. Yet I do not feel happy right now, I don't know what I feel really, it's a mixture.  
她讲完后，我承认自己有些语塞。我知道我得说些什么来安慰她。我需要告诉她，仅仅是她在这里与我共进晚餐，就足以让我感到无比幸福。然而此刻我并不觉得快乐，我真的不知道自己是什么感觉，复杂得很。

I feel afraid, afraid that the moment I have known will happen eventually but tried to avoid could happen soon and I am in no way ready for it. I feel embarrassed, embarrassed that I allowed myself to get carried away with my feelings for Asuka knowing what I do about her. I also feel ashamed at myself for thinking about her in such a way, when I should have been happy with the friendship I have.  
我感到害怕，害怕那个我明知终将发生却一直试图逃避的时刻可能很快就会到来，而我却毫无准备。我感到尴尬，尴尬的是我明知自己对明日香的感情，却还是放任自己沉溺其中。我也为自己以这种方式思念她而感到羞愧，毕竟我本应满足于我们之间的友谊。

I muster up as much of a smile as I can, "It is okay Asuka, I apologize that this seemed to coincide with such an event. If I had known this than I would not have…"  
我尽力挤出一个微笑，“没事的，明日香，我很抱歉这似乎与这样一个事件巧合了。如果我早知道的话，我就不会……”

"No please… Don't you dare apologize, you had no idea and this is… I really appreciate all of this." Asuka interrupts me, "This food… it's delicious and you are… well… never mind."  
“不，请别……你千万别道歉，你毫不知情，而且这……我真的非常感激这一切。”明日香打断了我，“这些食物……非常美味，而你……嗯……算了。”

I watch as she shakes her head and lowers her eyes, a moment later I too go back to staring at my empty plate. We both fall silent as I try to think of something to say to her. What has happened tonight is not the way that I had perhaps hoped it would. I don't really know what grand ideas I had in my head, ones perhaps influenced by romantic media and conversation. A fantasy where she would come over and jump into my arms.  
我看着她摇摇头，垂下眼帘，片刻后我也回到了盯着空盘子的状态。我们都陷入了沉默，我试图想出一些话对她说。今晚发生的一切并非我所期望的方式。我不太清楚自己脑海中那些宏大的想法是什么，或许受到了浪漫媒体和对话的影响。幻想中她会走过来，跳进我的怀里。

I realize how ridiculous that sounds though. In trying to work out my own feelings I had allowed my mind to wander down those paths. I allowed it to conjure up a fantasy where I would impress Asuka and by the end of the night confess my feelings. She would be impressed and confess hers and we would be… something.  
然而，我意识到这听起来多么荒谬。在努力理清自己的感情时，我让自己的思绪沿着那些路径游走。我允许它构建出一个幻想，在那里我会给明日香留下深刻印象，并在夜晚结束时表白我的感情。她会被打动，也表白她的感情，我们就会……成为某种关系。

Another silent minute passes us by as I continue to struggle for something to say to her. Everything I can think of now sounds ridiculous in comparison to what she has just told me. A part of me doesn't wish to talk about any of it. Perhaps it is selfish on my part but I am too scared to know why she made that sudden decision and too scared to speak about it further. What exactly am I scared of? Losing my friendship with her? Confirmation that my feelings are not reciprocated? I don't know, I'm just scared.  
又是一分钟悄然流逝，我仍在努力寻找话题与她交谈。此刻我想到的任何话，与她刚刚告诉我的事情相比，都显得荒谬可笑。我内心的一部分并不想谈论这些。或许这是我的自私，但我害怕知道她为何突然做出那个决定，也害怕进一步讨论。我究竟在害怕什么？失去与她的友谊？确认我的感情没有得到回应？我不知道，我只是害怕。

"Would you like me to leave?" Asuka finally speaks after another long and silent minute passes us by.  
“你想让我离开吗？”在又一段漫长的沉默之后，明日香终于开口问道。

I look up at her and shake my head, "N-No… Please, I would like you to stay, if you would like to of course. I am sorry for my silence I am just… finding it difficult to find appropriate words to say right now."  
我抬头看着她，摇了摇头，“不……请留下来，如果你愿意的话。对不起，我沉默了，只是……现在很难找到合适的话来说。”

I take in a deep breath and try to think things over one more time. I think about all Asuka has told me since I met her. How she vanished from their lives the way she did and how Rei was the one who found her. It is not hard for me to see that Asuka would perhaps be happier if she were to re-establish those bonds with those people. I would wish to see Asuka happy above all else so I should encourage that, should I not?  
我深吸一口气，试图再次仔细思考。自从遇见明日香以来，她告诉我的所有事情都在我脑海中回响。她如何突然从他们的生活中消失，又是如何被绫波找到的。不难看出，如果明日香能与那些人重建联系，她或许会更快乐。我希望看到明日香幸福，这是最重要的，所以我应该鼓励她这样做，不是吗？

I'm unable to bring myself to say anything yet. Instead I just look dumbly towards the kitchen and then back towards Asuka. I don't wish for Asuka to leave but I can sense her discomfort for being here, perhaps if I gave her the opportunity she could leave.  
我仍无法让自己说出任何话。我只是呆呆地望向厨房，然后又回头看向明日香。我不希望明日香离开，但我能感觉到她在这里的不适，也许如果我给她机会，她就能离开。

"I will go and get dessert. I made us ice cream, I hope you enjoy it as much as you did the steak."  
“我去拿甜点。我给咱们做了冰淇淋，希望你能像喜欢牛排一样喜欢它。”

I get up from my seat and wander over to the kitchen keeping my back turned. I crouch and open the freeze and put one hand in and on the tub of ice cream. Once there I wait for the inevitable to happen. Sure enough after a few seconds of waiting I hear the sound of Asuka getting up off of her chair. I close my eyes and listen for the sound of my door closing.  
我从座位上起身，背对着她走向厨房。我蹲下打开冰箱，伸手去拿那桶冰淇淋。在那里，我等待着不可避免的事情发生。果然，几秒钟后，我听到了明日香从椅子上站起来的声音。我闭上眼睛，等待着我的房门关闭的声音。

After thirty seconds I become confused when the sound doesn't come. I finally open my eyes and hear her voice, "Kaworu… Are you alright? You've been crouched there for a minute?"  
三十秒过去了，声音仍未出现，我感到困惑。最终，我睁开眼睛，听到了她的声音，“薰…你还好吗？你已经在那儿蹲了一分钟了？”

Her voice startles me and I jump in fright, pulling the tub of ice cream out of the freezer and knocking myself off balance, I land on the solid floor with a thud. Feeling somewhat embarrassed I slowly get up and turn to see her stood in the kitchen, "A-Asuka I thought you… I heard you get up and thought you had left."  
她的声音吓了我一跳，我惊慌失措地跳了起来，手中的冰淇淋桶从冰箱里被拽出，我失去了平衡，重重地摔在了坚硬的地板上。感到有些尴尬，我慢慢站起身，转身看到她站在厨房里，“明日香，我以为你…我听到你站起来，以为你已经离开了。”

"Idiot…" She chuckles, "I was coming to see if you needed any help. It's the least I could do for fucking your night up."  
"傻瓜…" 她轻笑道，"我是来看看你是否需要帮忙。打扰了你的夜晚，这是我起码能做的。"

"Oh…" I feel myself blush at her words as I clutch the tub of ice cream to my chest, "Then can… bowls…. Two please?"  
"哦…" 听到她的话，我感到脸颊发烫，紧紧抱住怀里的冰淇淋桶，"那可以…碗…两个，请吗？"

She nods and pulls two bowls out of a nearby cupboard and sets them down on the counter top. I place the tub of ice cream down near to them and reach into the drawer to retrieve the ice cream scoop I purchased. Before I'm able to find it I feel Asuka's hand on my wrist as she gently pulls it out of the drawer.  
她点点头，从附近的橱柜里拿出两个碗，放在台面上。我把冰淇淋桶放在它们旁边，伸手去抽屉里拿我买的冰淇淋勺。还没等我找到，就感觉到明日香的手放在我的手腕上，她轻轻地从抽屉里拉出勺子。

"Asuka what are you-" "Asuka 你在干什么-"

"Shut up." She commands me, "For just a moment there is something…"  
"闭嘴。" 她命令我，"就一会儿，有件事…"

She takes both of my wrists and guides me to the centre of my kitchen. I feel myself blush as her warm hands envelop my wrists and she looks into my eyes. She opens her mouth to say something but immediately closes it before shaking her head, "Kaworu can you… close your eyes for a moment please?"  
她握住我的双腕，带我到厨房中央。我感到脸颊发烫，她的温暖手掌包裹着我的手腕，她凝视着我的眼睛。她张开嘴想说些什么，但立刻又闭上了，摇了摇头，"Kaworu 你能…闭上眼睛一会儿吗？"

"Why?" I ask. "为什么？" 我问道。

"Just do it, please…" "请就这样做吧…"

I comply with the request and close my eyes completely unsure of what is to come next. The instant I shut them I feel her hands tighten around my wrists and I can sense her taking a step forward.  
我顺从了请求，完全不确定接下来会发生什么，闭上了眼睛。就在我闭上眼的那一刻，我感觉到她的双手紧紧握住我的手腕，我能感觉到她向前迈了一步。

"Kaworu…" I hear her speak, "I'm going to say something to you and I want you to listen to me and not say anything until I'm done, is that okay?"  
"渚薰……" 我听到她说话，"我要对你说些话，我希望你听我说完，不要插嘴，好吗？"

I nod. 我点点头。

"Good." She pauses for a moment, "I probably made a mistake by agreeing to come here tonight after what happened but… despite that I am glad I came. If anything it… and you and what you did earlier has… confirmed something I guess. Something I've been thinking about for a while."  
"很好。" 她停顿了一下，"我可能犯了个错误，同意今晚来这里，毕竟发生了那样的事……但尽管如此，我很高兴我来了。如果说有什么意义的话，那……你和你之前所做的……证实了一些事情，我想。一些我已经思考了一段时间的事情。"

I open my mouth to ask her what that thing is but immediately close it remembering her instruction from earlier.  
我张嘴想问她那东西是什么，但立刻又闭上了，想起了她之前的指示。

"I made some mistakes today but what I'm about to do… I'm certain this isn't a mistake."  
“今天我犯了一些错误，但我即将要做的事……我确信这不是一个错误。”

I feel her move forward again and then a brief moment later I feel a heat near to my face, close to my right cheek. Then a second later there is a softness that makes contact with my cheek. Almost instantly I open my eyes and see her moving her head away from me. She glares at me, "I thought I told you to keep your eyes closed!"  
我感觉到她再次向前移动，紧接着不久，我感到脸颊右侧附近传来一阵热意。然后一秒钟后，一种柔软触感轻触我的脸颊。我几乎立刻睁开眼睛，看到她正从我面前移开头部。她瞪着我，“我以为我告诉过你闭上眼睛！”

I open my mouth awkwardly, "A-Asuka I…"  
我尴尬地张开嘴，“A-明日香，我…”

I don't quite know what to make of what has just happened. Did Asuka really just do what I think she did? If so what does that mean? What do I do now? How do I respond to that? I stand there dumbly as she continues to glare at me. I can no longer speak but it seems to don't need to. Her glare softens, and she moves forward again.  
我不是很明白刚刚发生了什么。明日香真的做了我认为她做的事吗？如果是的话那意味着什么？我现在该怎么办？我该如何回应？我呆呆地站在那里，她继续瞪着我。我再也说不出话来，但似乎也不需要了。她的目光变得柔和，再次向前迈进。

"I was right, that wasn't a mistake."  
“我猜对了，那不是个错误。”

This time my cheek is not the target and I'm ready for it. She presses her lips up against my own and my instincts take over. I bring my hands up and place them slowly and carefully on her back. I respond by trying to return the kiss as best I can. I can feel her arms come up and wrap themselves around me and we stand there for over a minute of blissful silence.  
这次我的脸颊不再是目标，我已做好准备。她将双唇紧贴在我的唇上，我的本能随即接管。我抬起双手，缓慢而谨慎地放在她的背上。我尽力回应，试图以最好的方式回吻。我能感觉到她的手臂抬起，环绕着我，我们就这样在幸福的静谧中站立了超过一分钟。

### Chapter 8: A Story Never Told  
第八章：未曾讲述的故事  

**14****th** **September 2021** 2021 年 9 月 14 日

**Asuka Langley Soryu – Early Morning  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷 —— 清晨时分**

**Kaworu's Apartment 渚薰的公寓**

I slowly open my eyes to be greeted by the slightest slither of light coming in through the curtains. It's funny in a way but this sofa and this room is actually starting to feel like a second home to me. The first night I spent here had been uncomfortable, I've always struggled with sleep as it is never mind in an unfamiliar home and on a sofa but now I'm starting to feel slightly comfortable waking up here. Maybe I should leave some things here for the next time.  
我缓缓睁开眼，迎接我的是透过窗帘缝隙的一丝微光。说来也怪，这张沙发和这个房间竟开始让我觉得像第二个家了。第一晚在这里过夜时还很不舒服，我本就难以入睡，更别提在陌生的家中、在沙发上了，但现在醒来时却感到些许自在。或许下次来时，我该留下些东西。

I have to laugh at that strange thought. Only yesterday I was considering cutting off all contact with Kaworu. I was considering running away and never seeing him again, an effort to protect him from me. Or maybe it was just an effort to try to make sure I'm unhappy like I seem to feel I should be.  
想到这个奇怪的念头，我不禁笑出声来。就在昨天，我还考虑过与渚薰断绝所有联系。我曾想过逃离，再也不见他，只为保护他免受我的影响。又或许，这只是我试图确保自己像我认为应该感到的那样不快乐。

When I agreed to go to dinner with him I didn't think it'd be like it was, I didn't think he'd have cooked. I thought it'd be a matter of going out to dinner and then saying goodnight. It wasn't his fault but him going to that effort triggered something inside of me, that voice that tells me I'm horrible and don't deserve anything nice, certain not all that Kaworu had done for me. I so very nearly fucked up the night by listening to that voice. Still even without the voice I didn't think I'd have ended up staying the night, nor did I think I'd have kissed him.  
当我答应和他共进晚餐时，我没想到会是那样，没想到他会亲自下厨。我原以为只是出去吃个饭，然后道声晚安。这并非他的错，但他如此用心却触动了我内心某个角落，那个声音告诉我，我是个糟糕的人，不配拥有任何美好，更别提 Kaworu 为我所做的一切。我差点就因为听信那个声音而搞砸了那个夜晚。即便没有那个声音，我也从未想过会留宿，更没想到会吻他。

The kiss, was wonderful, awkward but I suppose that is to be expected. It would have been Kaworu's first kiss after all and I'm not exactly massively experienced in that department either. My first kiss was with Shinji and I don't need to go over how much of a disaster that was again. I've never really been one for too much kissing since then. It's always been something of a means to an end, just something to get the blood flowing but little emotion/passion in there.  
那个吻，美妙而尴尬，但我想这是可以预料的。毕竟这可能是 Kaworu 的初吻，而我在这方面也并非经验丰富。我的初吻是和 Shinji，无需赘述那场灾难有多严重。自那以后，我并不热衷于接吻。它总是被当作达到目的的手段，只是为了激发血液流动，而缺乏情感或激情。

Kissing in a certain way always seemed to be romantic to me, something you'd save for the person you love. Thing about having a one-night stand is that both of you don't really care about love and romance, you're there for a brief bit of fun and then you move on and never see them again. So of the two encounters I've had sticking to the no/little kissing rule has been quite easy.  
以某种方式接吻对我来说总是显得很浪漫，是留给心爱之人的特别之举。一夜情的问题在于，双方并不真正在意爱情和浪漫，只是为了短暂的乐趣，然后各自前行，再不相见。所以在我经历过的两次中，坚持不接吻或少接吻的原则相当容易。

What wasn't as easy was stemming those feelings of guilt and the voices telling me how horrible I am for a few days afterwards. I don't know what else I expected to happen though. I mean I am me after all. I can barely even please myself without feeling guilty afterwards so what did I expect when someone else is involved?  
更难的是抑制那些事后几天的内疚感和指责我有多糟糕的声音。不过，我也不知道自己还期待什么。毕竟，我就是我。连让自己开心后都感到内疚，更别提牵扯到别人时我会期待什么了。

I don't feel strange nor do I feel any guilt about kissing Kaworu though. What happened last night was something I wanted to do, something that felt right to do and something that made me feel good and I'm damn sure it made him feel good too. Thinking about the kiss is actually making me smile, I can still feel Kaworu's soft lips on mine and him holding me gently in his arms.  
不过，我对亲吻渚薰既不感到奇怪，也没有任何内疚。昨晚发生的事是我想要做的，感觉对了，也让我感觉很好，我敢肯定他也感觉很好。一想到那个吻，我就忍不住微笑，我仍能感受到渚薰柔软的唇瓣和他在我怀中温柔的拥抱。

Despite being inexperienced he seems to have eased into it fairly quickly. We kissed for what must have been well over a minute, both of us stood there holding one another peacefully. At no point did Kaworu try to overstep any boundaries. I suppose that was probably down to Kaworu not really knowing what to do and maybe a bit of fear of any retaliation from me.  
尽管缺乏经验，他似乎很快就适应了。我们接吻了足有一分钟之久，两人静静地站在那里相拥。Kaworu 没有试图越界。我想这大概是因为 Kaworu 不太知道该怎么做，或许还有点害怕我会反击。

I did sense some awkwardness from him after we finished kissing, both of us wondering what to do next. I could see the embarrassment in Kaworu's face and also feel that his body clearly seemed to have an idea of what he wanted to do next but I decided to not draw attention to that. Instead I backed away slowly and allowed him to settle down before asking him to finish preparing the ice cream.  
接吻结束后，我感觉到他有些尴尬，我们都在想接下来该做什么。我能看到 Kaworu 脸上的尴尬，也能感觉到他的身体显然知道他下一步想做什么，但我决定不去注意这一点。相反，我慢慢后退，让他平静下来，然后请他继续准备冰淇淋。

We didn't sit at his dining table for the ice cream, instead we sat on the couch and put on a concert DVD he had bought. We had a spoon each and managed to finish off the entire tub before the concert had finished. The ice cream, for the record, was just as delicious as the main meal was.  
我们没有坐在餐桌旁吃冰淇淋，而是坐在沙发上，放了他买的音乐会 DVD。我们每人一把勺子，在音乐会结束前就把整桶冰淇淋吃完了。值得一提的是，这冰淇淋和主餐一样美味。

Shortly afterwards we realized just how late it was and instead of me getting a taxi back Kaworu asked if I would like to stay the night. I agreed and he brought out some sheets and pillows for me to sleep on the sofa. A part of me considered asking to sleep in his bed but I held back, maybe that'd be a step too far for the moment.  
不久之后，我们意识到时间已经很晚了，于是 Kaworu 提议我是否愿意留宿一晚，而不是打车回家。我同意了，他拿出一些床单和枕头让我睡在沙发上。我心里有一部分在考虑是否要请求睡在他的床上，但我忍住了，也许那对目前来说太过分了。

In addition there were things I wanted to think about. A vast number of questions started to enter my head. What exactly are me and Kaworu now? Are we boyfriend and girlfriend? I do like him, I've already admitted that to myself and I wouldn't have kissed him if I didn't but I still wonder about him. Does he like me because I'm the first person to reach out to him? If he does then how far will this go?  
此外，我还有许多事情需要思考。大量的问题开始涌入我的脑海。我和 Kaworu 现在到底是什么关系？我们是男女朋友吗？我确实喜欢他，我已经向自己承认了这一点，如果不是喜欢他，我就不会吻他。但我仍然对他感到好奇。他喜欢我是因为我是第一个向他伸出援手的人吗？如果是这样，这段关系会走多远？

I have other things to think about too. I was going to contact Shinji yesterday, I was going to speak to Rei as well but now this has happened. Do I explain this to her? Do I tell Shinji? Will Kaworu want me to contact Shinji and tell him? What will those two think about this? In a way I know it's none of their business but I know how tangled the web is between the four of us and I'm sick of it.  
我还有其他事情需要考虑。我原本打算昨天联系真嗣，也想和绫波谈谈，但现在这一切发生了。我需要向她解释吗？我应该告诉真嗣吗？Kaworu 会希望我联系真嗣并告诉他吗？那两个人会怎么想这件事？从某种程度上我知道这不关他们的事，但我知道我们四个人之间的关系错综复杂，我对此感到厌倦。

I know with a few words I can start untangling that web but I don't want to hurt people, least of all Shinji. I don't want this web to be so tangled anymore.  
我知道只需几句话就能开始解开那团乱麻，但我不想伤害任何人，尤其是真嗣。我不希望这团乱麻再纠缠不清了。

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

It's morning and I have been awake for at least an hour but have not yet gotten out of my bed. Instead I've been lying here with my mind wandering through a maze of thoughts about last night and questions about me, my past and who I am and was.  
天已破晓，我至少醒了一个小时，却仍未离开床铺。相反，我躺在这里，思绪在关于昨晚和关于我、我的过去以及我是谁、曾经是谁的迷宫中游走。

Thoughts of last night echo prominently in my mind for the moment. Asuka... Last night she kissed me and it was such a wonderful thing. It was astonishing. In fact, I don't think I can find an adjective suitable to sum up the experience.  
昨晚的思绪此刻在我脑海中回响。明日香……昨晚她吻了我，那感觉如此美妙。令人惊叹。事实上，我觉得找不到一个合适的形容词来概括那种体验。

Yet, despite how wonderful the experience was I still feel an amount of trepidation about the whole thing. I worry that despite my enjoyment of it that it might not have been as good for Asuka. I question if perhaps I should have done more during the kiss, I wonder if she was expecting me to do more or even if I might have done too much when I held her. I even question If I was any good at kissing her.  
然而，尽管这次经历如此美妙，我心中仍有一丝忐忑。我担心尽管我乐在其中，但对明日香来说可能并不那么美好。我怀疑自己是否在接吻时做得不够，她是否期待我做更多，或者我抱着她时是否做得过火了。我甚至怀疑自己吻她时是否做得好。

In addition, there was one other slight problem I experienced whilst kissing her. It's an issue that I've only had to deal with when on my own and never in the company of another person. Being kissed and held by her in such away aroused me and to be in that state in front of another person was embarrassing. I don't know if Asuka noticed it, I hope that she didn't, she didn't call attention to it if she did but regardless it was not a comfortable experience.  
此外，在吻她时我还遇到了一个小问题。这是一个我独自一人时才会遇到的问题，从未在他人面前经历过。被她那样亲吻和拥抱，让我感到兴奋，而在别人面前处于这种状态实在令人尴尬。我不知道明日香是否注意到了，我希望她没有，即使她注意到了也没有提及，但无论如何，那都不是一次舒适的体验。

If anything, to have my body betray me in such a way was humbling and slightly terrifying. I was aware that the human body does respond in such a way but I didn't expect to happen to quickly and it to feel like it did. In truth, it scared me and I worry that if I felt awkward in that situation how would I feel if it had progressed further?  
如果说有什么让我感到意外，那就是我的身体以这种方式背叛了我，既令人谦卑又略带恐怖。我知道人体确实会以这种方式反应，但我没料到会这么快发生，并且感觉如此强烈。事实上，这让我感到害怕，我担心如果我在那种情况下都感到尴尬，那么情况进一步发展时我又会有何感受？

It was further confirmation that I am definitely not the same Kaworu of years ago. Arousal was not something I felt in that form and unlike now I did not have any qualms back then about being naked in front of others. For me the body I inhabited was little more than an instrument to carry me forward into the next form.  
这进一步证实了我绝非多年前的那位渚薰。在那个形态下，我从未感受过性欲，而且与现在不同，那时我并不介意在别人面前赤身裸体。对我来说，我所占据的身体不过是一个将我带入下一个形态的工具罢了。

Now however my body is so much more and I am aware of it in ways that I wasn't before. I am aware of how it looks, I am aware of how it feels, I am aware of size and of my differences. I have found myself comparing my body to others and understanding how I am different to them. To describe it best, previously I was inhabiting a body but it felt more like my consciousness was merely floating above it. Perhaps not too dissimilar to how Asuka or Shinji would feel in an Evangelion. Now I feel that I am as one with my body, both myself and it are in sync.  
如今，我的身体变得如此丰富，我以从前未曾有过的方式感知它。我意识到它的外观，感受到它的触感，察觉到尺寸与差异。我发现自己开始将身体与他人比较，理解我们之间的不同。最贴切的描述或许是，过去我只是居住在一个身体里，但我的意识仿佛只是漂浮其上。或许与明日香或真嗣在 EVA 中的感受相差无几。现在，我感到自己与身体融为一体，自我与它同步一致。

With this heightened awareness also comes feelings of guilt with how I might have acted towards others and how I might have made them uncomfortable. I can now understand the awkwardness that Shinji Ikari felt around me many years ago when I spoke to him and when I walked around naked in front of him. I remember finding it curious how he blushed and averted his eyes when in the showers with him. When he flinched as I touched his hand and panicked as I asked him to go to bed.  
随着这种增强的意识，也带来了对过去可能对他人行为感到的内疚，以及可能让他们感到不适的反思。我现在能理解多年前真嗣一护在我身边时的尴尬，当我与他交谈，或在他面前赤身裸体走动时。我记得当时觉得奇怪，他在淋浴间里脸红避开视线。当我触碰他的手时他畏缩，当我要求他上床时他惊慌失措。

I understand why he was awkward now and Shinji, if I could see you again then I would say that I am sorry for that. I understand now and I did not mean to make you uncomfortable. If I had known then what I know now I would not have acted the way I did at all.  
我现在明白他为何显得笨拙了，真嗣，如果我能再次见到你，我会说对不起。我现在明白了，无意让你感到不适。如果当时我知道现在所知的一切，我绝不会那样行事。

I angrily shake my head at that last thought, if I had known then what I know now? That was the point wasn't it? That was why SEELE treated and raised me the way they did so that I wouldn't act any differently. They kept me in such a state so that I would push forward to try to wipe out this world and betray my first friend in such a way without hesitation. They were responsible for who I was!  
对于那个最后的念头，我愤怒地摇了摇头，如果当时我知道现在所知的一切？这就是关键所在，不是吗？这就是为什么 SEELE 那样对待和抚养我，以免我行为有所不同。他们让我保持那种状态，以便我毫不犹豫地推动毁灭这个世界，背叛我的第一个朋友。他们要为我是谁负责！

Yes I am sorry for what I did. Yes, maybe I could have acted differently and I accept that ultimately my actions were my own but I am not blameless in this scenario. It is not a matter of if I ever saw Shinji again I would apologize but a matter of when. I can't help but feel our meeting is inevitable and when that time comes I know I will be terrified but I will face him and apologize for my actions.  
是的，我为我所做的事感到抱歉。是的，也许我可以有不同的行为，我承认最终我的行动是我自己的选择，但我在这件事上并非无辜。这不是如果我再次见到真嗣我会道歉，而是何时。我无法不觉得我们的相遇是不可避免的，当那一刻到来时，我知道我会害怕，但我会面对他，为我的行为道歉。

The idea of that meeting does frighten me somewhat. I know not how such a thing would happen but after Asuka informing me last night of her desire to re-establish contact with him I know it will. These thoughts in turn bring me back to the kiss last night. I wonder what this means for me and Asuka going forward, I wonder what we are to one another? Are we a couple now? Will this go further or will she discover she made a mistake and say that this can't go further?  
那个会面的念头确实让我有些害怕。我不知道这样的事情是如何发生的，但自从昨晚明日香告诉我她想与他重新建立联系后，我知道这必将发生。这些思绪又让我回想起昨晚的那个吻。我不知道这对我和明日香的未来意味着什么，我们彼此之间究竟算什么？我们现在是一对了吗？这段关系会进一步发展，还是她会发现这是个错误，然后说这不能再继续下去了？

I wonder what I am to Asuka? I know she has feelings to Shinji, that much is obvious so if she were to re-establish contact with him then what would that mean for me? Is what we might have only temporary and should I therefore enjoy it whilst I can?  
我不知道我在明日香心中算什么？我知道她对真嗣有感情，这一点很明显，所以如果她决定与他重新联系，那对我来说意味着什么？我们可能拥有的关系只是暂时的吗？我是否应该趁现在享受它？

I have so many questions and lying here is only causing me to go in circles thinking about them. Perhaps I should just get up and see what the day brings.  
我有太多问题，躺在这里只会让我陷入无休止的思考循环。也许我应该起床，看看今天会带来什么。

**Rei Ayanami  绫波零**

**Emergence Facility Café 紧急设施咖啡馆**

As I enter the cafeteria I feel my phone vibrate inside my handbag. I stop for a moment to take my phone out and check the message. As I both thought and hoped the message is from Asuka and I quickly open it to check the contents.  
当我走进食堂时，我感觉到手机在我的手提包里震动。我停了一会儿，拿出手机查看消息。正如我所想并希望的那样，消息来自明日香，我迅速打开它查看内容。

_'Hi Rei, everything is fine here, there is nothing for you to worry about. I will contact you later, I have something I want you to look at and give me advice on. Also, I'm sorry about what happened with Shinji yesterday, I didn't think he would pick up. I hope I didn't cause any trouble for you.'  
'嗨，绫波，这里一切都好，没什么让你担心的。我稍后会联系你，有件事我想让你看看并给我一些建议。另外，对于昨天和真嗣发生的事情，我很抱歉，我没想到他会接电话。希望我没有给你带来麻烦。'_

I can't help but feel there is something slightly strange about the message Asuka has sent me, in fact there are two strange things about the message. I read through it once more for confirmation. First of all, Asuka is asking me for advice on something. That is extremely rare, if anything I'm usually the one asking her for advice where possible, especially in the earlier stages of our friendship when I was still discovering certain things.  
我不禁觉得明日香发给我的这条信息有些奇怪，实际上，这条信息有两处不寻常。我又仔细读了一遍以确认。首先，明日香在向我寻求建议。这种情况极为罕见，通常都是我尽可能向她请教，尤其是在我们友谊初期，我还在探索某些事情的时候。

Secondly Asuka has called Shinji by his name. Come to think of it she did a similar thing the last time we spoke but it didn't register properly in my mind. Perhaps I thought it was a simple slip of the tongue or she didn't realize due to other circumstances. This however, this had to have been deliberate. Which of course makes me curious.  
其次，明日香直接称呼了真嗣的名字。回想起来，上次我们交谈时她也有类似的行为，但当时我并未在意。也许我当时以为那只是口误，或是由于其他情况她没有意识到。但这次，这肯定是故意的。这自然让我感到好奇。

Asuka has not said Shinji's name in a very long time, it is a fact that makes me quite sad that my best friend is unable to speak my brother's name. At the same time, I am also saddened by the fact that my brother is unable to speak by best friend's name. I don't know why the two of them are like this, perhaps it was a way to shield themselves from some sort of pain. Either way they have not mentioned one another's by name for a few years.  
明日香已经很久没有叫过真嗣的名字了，这让我感到非常难过，因为我最好的朋友无法说出我哥哥的名字。同时，我也为我的哥哥无法说出我最好朋友的名字而感到悲伤。我不知道他们为什么会这样，也许这是一种保护自己免受某种痛苦的方式。无论如何，他们已经有好几年没有互相提及对方的名字了。

I wonder then what has caused Asuka to suddenly start to speak Shinji's name again, not only in this message but in our conversation a couple of weeks ago. I wonder if there is some significance to her doing this. Almost immediately I wonder if maybe this is a sign that she is ready to come back and see us all again. I would like that so much  
那么，是什么让明日香突然又开始叫真嗣的名字了呢？不仅在这条消息中，还有几周前我们的对话里。我想知道她这样做是否有某种意义。我几乎立刻想到，这可能是一个迹象，表明她已经准备好回来见我们大家了。我非常希望如此。

Unfortunately, I am unable to find out the reasoning at the moment in time. I have a reason for being here and it would be bad of me to suddenly leave. I put my phone away and slowly walk towards one of the many free tables in the cafeteria. As I walk I can feel the eyes of the few people in the facility on me, I wonder if they are looking at me because of what I look like or because I'm one of the few people to pass through here in quite some time.  
遗憾的是，我目前无法查明其中的缘由。我来到这里是有原因的，突然离开会显得我不够负责。我将手机收起，缓缓走向食堂里众多空桌中的一张。行走间，我能感觉到设施内寥寥数人的目光落在我身上，我不禁疑惑，他们是因为我的外貌而注视我，还是因为我是这里许久未见的来客之一。

I sit myself down and start to observe. There are so very few people here, at one point this place might have dealt with a hundred or so people emerging from instrumentality a week. Now I believe it is barely any, in fact aside from Nagisa I don't know if there have been any people emerge in the past year. It is my understanding that he was the first person they had recovered in quite some time.  
我坐下开始观察四周。这里的人实在太少了，曾经这个地方每周可能有上百人从一体化中苏醒。如今，我相信人数已寥寥无几，事实上，除了渚之外，我不确定过去一年里还有没有其他人苏醒。据我所知，他是他们很久以来第一个恢复的人。

I sit for another minute or two before I see the person I am supposed to meet finally arrive. Kodama Horaki, she is about a year or older in appearence than her sister Hikari and fairly similar in appearance. Much like Hikari she also wears her hair in two shoulder length pigtails and each of her cheeks is also dotted with a small number of freckles.  
我又坐了一两分钟，直到我该见的人终于出现。葛城光，她看起来比她的妹妹光年纪稍大一些，外貌也颇为相似。和光一样，她也扎着两个齐肩的辫子，脸颊上散布着少许雀斑。

She has a soft, caring expression which I suppose fits someone who works in a facility such as this and she is at the moment wearing a pair of glasses with a thin black rim. She is also wearing the uniform of this facility which is something of a contrast to the short black dress she was wearing on our blind date the other night.  
她有着温柔关切的神情，我想这很适合在这样一个机构工作的人，而且她此刻戴着一副细黑框眼镜。她还穿着这个机构的制服，这与前几晚我们初次见面时她穿的黑色短裙形成了鲜明对比。

I must admit, when I agreed to go on that blind date that had been arranged by Hikari I was quite apprehensive. I disliked the idea of going on a date with someone I had not selected or met previously but I trusted Hikari's judgement. I did not expect that the date be with her sister, nor did I expect to find her sister so attractive and charming.  
我必须承认，当我同意参加光安排的这次相亲时，我相当忐忑。我不喜欢与一个未经自己选择或事先认识的人约会，但我信任光的判断。我没想到约会对象会是她的姐姐，更没想到她姐姐会如此迷人且有魅力。

Kodama notices me and give me a quick smile because making her way over to where I am sitting. I get up from my seat and we both smile and nod at each other politely, "Hey Rei! I'm sorry I didn't get here sooner. We've had a few people come back this week so I've been busy dealing with the paperwork from all that. You haven't been waiting long, have you?"  
小球注意到我，给了我一个快速的微笑，因为她正朝我坐的地方走来。我从座位上站起来，我们俩都礼貌地微笑点头，“嘿，玲！对不起，我没能早点到这里。这周有几个人回来了，所以我一直在忙于处理所有的文件。你没等太久吧？”

I glance up at the clock and contrary to what Kodama has said I can see it is still another couple of minutes to go until we are supposed to meet. I shake my head, "No, I have not been waiting long. You are early as well actually."  
我抬头看了一眼时钟，与小球所说的相反，我看到离我们约定见面的时间还有几分钟。我摇了摇头，“不，我没等太久。实际上，你也早到了。”

Kodama turns to look at the clock herself and shakes her head, "Damn clocks in the office must be wrong then. Can I get you anything? They do a really good hot chocolate here?"  
小球自己也转头看向时钟，摇了摇头，“该死的办公室时钟一定是错了。我能为你点些什么吗？这里的热巧克力真的很不错。”

I nod, "That sounds nice, I would like that then."  
我点头，“听起来不错，那我就期待了。”

"No problem, I'll be back in a moment then."  
“没问题，我一会儿就回来。”

I watch Kodama as she gets up and goes to get our drinks. Whilst she is gone I take the opportunity to look around the facility once again. Her informing me that others have been returning has intrigued me. I wonder how many people in total have come back this year and if this has something to do with Nagisa suddenly returning earlier this year.  
我看着儿玉起身去取我们的饮料。在她离开的间隙，我再次环顾了一下设施。她告诉我其他人也在陆续回来，这引起了我的兴趣。我想知道今年总共有多少人回来了，这是否与渚今年早些时候突然回来有关。

Perhaps it is the case that Nagisa returning was the beginning of a new wave of returnees. Although I fail to see how this could be the case. The way to return is for a person to want to come back and to be able to imagine themselves in one's heart. I fail to see how one person returning could allow others to do that. It is likely this is just coincidence, after all as long as there are people still within instrumentality the possibility remains that they will return.  
或许渚的归来正是新一轮归乡潮的开始。尽管我难以理解这如何可能。归来的途径是个人渴望返回，并在心中能想象自己回归。我不明白一个人的归来如何能让其他人也做到这一点。很可能这只是巧合，毕竟只要还有人留在工具化状态中，他们回归的可能性就依然存在。

The fact that people can still return is one that makes me feel somewhat anxious. I know that there is one person still within that sea who is unlikely to ever want to come back. Yet I fear that one day we will find out that he has returned and I worry that his return would ruin the stability we have enjoyed for so very long. It has not been perfect but it is better than anything he could have offered.  
人们仍能回归的事实让我感到些许不安。我知道海中还有一个人不太可能想要回来。然而我担心有一天我们会发现他已经归来，我担忧他的回归会破坏我们长久以来享受的稳定。这份稳定虽不完美，但总比他能提供的任何东西都要好。

I shake my head, I am not here to contemplate the return nor even the existence of that man. I am here to find out what I can about Nagisa. I admit, I do feel bad about suddenly coming to Kodama and asking for this. I do understand that it might make me look bad in her eyes but I am only trying to ensure Asuka and Shinji are safe and I hope Kodama understands.  
我摇了摇头，我来这里不是为了思考那个男人的回归，甚至不是为了思考他的存在。我是来了解关于渚的事情。我承认，突然来到儿玉这里询问这些，我确实感到有些抱歉。我明白这可能会让她对我产生不好的看法，但我只是想确保明日香和真嗣的安全，希望儿玉能理解。

At the same time, I am also here to see Kodama again, I enjoyed our date together and I would very much like to go on another one, if that is something she desires.  
同时，我也是来看望儿玉的，我很享受我们在一起的约会，如果她愿意，我非常希望能再有一次约会。

Just as I finish that thought she returns with a tray and two cups of hot chocolate. She lowers it onto the table and I take one of the cups from the tray and wrap my arms around it enjoying the warm sensations spreading through my fingers.  
就在我这么想着的时候，她端着一个托盘回来了，上面有两杯热巧克力。她把托盘放在桌上，我从托盘上拿起一杯，用双臂环绕着它，享受着温暖的感觉从手指间蔓延开来。

"How are you then Rei?"  
"那么，丽，你最近怎么样？"

"I am good." I reply, "Are you doing well?"  
"我很好。" 我回答道，"你呢，还好吗？"

She nods and gives me a cute smile, "I'm good! Just been a bit busier recently due to more people returning. It's nowhere near as busy as it used to be a couple of years ago but they also moved a lot of staff on so it's little more than a skeleton crew here so double or triple the work."  
她点点头，给了我一个可爱的微笑，"我挺好的！只是最近因为更多人回来了，所以稍微忙了一些。虽然远不及几年前那么繁忙，但他们也调走了不少员工，现在这里基本上只剩个骨架团队，工作量翻了两三倍。"

"Has this only just started?" I ask.  
"这是刚刚才开始吗？" 我问道。

"Started picking up again in February actually, started out at just one or two a week, around April it was five or six and in the past week we've had at least ten. They've actually been looking at pulling in more staff to cover it, problem is a lot of people who used to work here have moved on to higher paying places and won't want to come back so we're looking at juniors and volunteers for the moment."  
"实际上从二月份开始又多了起来，起初每周只有一两个，到了四月份变成了五六個，而过去这一周我们至少有十个。他们其实已经在考虑增加人手来应对，问题是很多以前在这里工作的人已经去了薪水更高的地方，不愿意回来，所以我们目前只能考虑招初级员工和志愿者。"

"I see." I nod and make a note in my head to speak to Misato about the situation. Perhaps she might be able to find someone to speak to someone who can arrange help for Kodama and the facility, "I hope that you are able to get the help needed here soon."  
"我明白了。" 我点头，暗自记下要和美里谈谈这个情况。也许她能找到人帮忙解决小玉和设施的问题，"我希望你们能尽快得到所需的帮助。"

"Me too!" She sips from her drink, "I suspect... that you're not here to speak to me about my work, are you? Or at least, not what I've been up to in the past week anyway."  
"我也是！" 她啜饮了一口饮料，"我猜……你来这里不是为了谈我的工作，对吧？或者至少，不是我过去一周的动态。"

I shake my head, "No... I am not."  
我摇了摇头，"不……我不是。"

"This is about that one who came back in January isn't it? Kaworu?"  
"这是关于一月份回来的那个人，对吧？薰？"

I can feel the tightening sensation of guilt in my chest as I hear the disappointment in her voice.  
我听到她声音中的失望，胸口感到一阵内疚的紧缩感。

"I apologize I did not mean to misle-"  
"我道歉，我不是有意误导——"

She shakes her head, "No, it's fine, I sort of expected it to be honest. Can I just ask... and be honest, when you agreed to that date did you... did you know?"  
她摇摇头，"不，没关系，老实说，我有点预料到了。我只想问……你能诚实回答吗，当你同意那个约会时，你……你知道吗？"

I shake my head, "No I did not, it was not until I met you and you told me that I learned about you working here. I also... that is not the only reason I am here."  
我摇摇头，“不，我没有，直到遇见你并听你说起，我才知道你在这里工作。而且……我来这里不仅仅是为了这个原因。”

She raises a curious eyebrow, "Oh?"  
她好奇地挑起眉毛，“哦？”

"I also wanted to ask if you would like to see me again. I very much enjoyed our time together on that date and would like to see you again. I apologize for being here to ask about Nagisa but I am very worried about a friend."  
“我还想问你是否愿意再见到我。我非常享受我们那次约会的时光，希望能再次见到你。我很抱歉来这里询问渚的事情，但我真的很担心一个朋友。”

"I see, in which case I understand." She pauses, "Dinner tonight then?"  
"我明白了，那样的话我能理解。" 她停顿了一下，"那今晚一起吃晚饭？"

"Yes, that would be nice."  
"好的，那太好了。"

"Okay then, I'll come and pick you up at around seven." She takes another sip from her cup, "So what do you want to know about Kaworu, keep in mind I can't tell you too much. I know... what he was especially in relation to you guys but some things have to remain private."  
"那就这么定了，我大概七点左右来接你。" 她又从杯子里喝了一口，"那么，你想了解关于渚薰的哪些事情呢？记住，我不能告诉你太多。我知道...他特别与你们的关系，但有些事情必须保持私密。"

"I understand, I would not want you to put your job at risk." I reply, "Was there anything unusual about his return?"  
"我明白，我也不希望你因我而冒险。" 我回答道，"他回来时有什么不寻常的地方吗？"

Kodama shrugs, "Nothing really, pretty standard across the board. He had a bit of emergence sickness but aside from that he seemed healthy enough."  
Kodama 耸了耸肩，"其实没什么特别的，各方面都很正常。他有点出现症，但除此之外看起来还算健康。"

Kodama pauses for a moment, "Well... There is one thing I suppose."  
Kodama 停顿了一下，"嗯... 我想有一件事。"

I raise an eyebrow out of curiosity, "Oh?"  
我出于好奇挑了挑眉，“哦？”

"Well most people... When they emerge, they come out the same age as when they went in. It happened to me, it's why I only look a year or two older than Hikari despite the age gap technically being a bit bigger. That didn't happen with Kaworu, he actually aged during the process."  
“嗯，大多数人……他们出来时，年龄和进去时一样。我就是这样，所以我看起来只比光年长一两岁，尽管实际年龄差距其实更大一些。但这对渚来说不一样，他在过程中真的变老了。”

"I see, and this has never happened before?"  
“我明白了，这种情况以前从未发生过吗？”

Kodama shakes her head, "Not to my knowledge but... although it was a bit strange he was perfectly healthy regardless."  
木灵摇了摇头，“据我所知没有，但……尽管他有些奇怪，身体却非常健康。”

I take in her words and wonder if there is any importance to them. Kaworu aged whilst in Instrumentality but I wonder if that means anything. It is certainly curious to say the least but I fail to see how it affects anything.  
我琢磨着她的话，思索其中是否蕴含深意。渚薰在人类补完计划中成长了，但我不确定这是否意味着什么。这无疑令人好奇，但我想不出这对现状有何影响。

"I see, and there was nothing unusual around him?" I'm not quite sure what sort of answer I'd expect to this question. Am I expecting A.T. Fields to have just started appearing at random? Objects to be thrown around or people to start having visions?  
“我明白了，他周围没有什么异常吗？”我不太确定这个问题会得到什么样的答案。难道我期待着 A.T.力场突然随机出现？物体四处飞散或人们开始产生幻觉？

Again Kodama shakes her head, "No, nothing at all."  
柯达玛再次摇头，“不，一点也没有。”

"I see." “我明白了。”

"You sound almost disappointed." Kodama smirks as she speaks and I feel my cheeks glow red slightly. I don't quite know what I expected to hear today from her but I was hoping for something, perhaps anything that might prove me right that Kaworu can't be trusted.  
"“你听起来几乎有些失望。”柯达玛说着微微一笑，我感到自己的脸颊微微泛红。我不太清楚今天从她那里期待听到什么，但我希望有什么，或许任何能证明我不信任川吕的事情。”

"What about Kaworu himself?" I ask fearing that I already know the answer.  
"关于薰本人呢？" 我问道，心中害怕已知答案。

"He was a nice person Rei, he was terrified of us all at first which is understandable given who he was but he did as we asked and he kept to himself." Kodama pauses, "You know I… I felt sorry for him. He had clearly been through a lot and he told me a lot of things too."  
"他是个好人，丽。起初他对我们所有人都感到害怕，考虑到他的身份，这是可以理解的，但他按照我们的要求做了，并且保持自我。" 小玉停顿了一下，"你知道吗，我……我为他感到难过。他显然经历了很多，也告诉了我很多事情。"

"Things you are unable to repeat?" I ask.  
"那些你无法复述的事情？" 我问道。

She nods, "Yes things I can't repeat but the more I spoke to him the more I realized that he isn't a bad person, he was a victim too."  
她点头，“是的，有些事我无法重复，但越是与他交谈，我越意识到他并非坏人，他也是受害者。”

"I see." Her words only echo the same things that Asuka has already told me about Nagisa. They are not the words I was hoping to hear or perhaps wanting to hear. They are not the words that confirm to me that Nagisa is a bad guy, they are instead the words that paint him as afraid and nice and a victim.  
“我明白了。”她的这番话不过是重复了明日香已经告诉我的关于渚的事情。这些并非我所期待或渴望听到的，也不是证实渚是坏人的话语。相反，它们描绘出他是一个害怕、善良且同样是受害者的形象。

"I'm sorry I can't tell you what you want to hear Rei." Kodama speaks up, "I know what it's like to be scared for a friend, I've seen my own friends do things and I've been terrified about them, hell my own sister when she started seeing Touji… I wanted to see only bad in him."  
“抱歉，丽，我无法告诉你你想听的。”儿玉开口道，“我知道为朋友担惊受怕的滋味，我见过自己的朋友做出一些事，我曾为他们感到恐惧，甚至我自己的妹妹开始和透司交往时……我只希望看到他的缺点。”

I look up at her and laugh, "It isn't that far fortunately. My friend has met him and is friends with him. I was concerned that he might hurt her. Do you think I am wrong to feel this way?"  
我抬头看着她，笑了起来，“幸好并不远。我的朋友已经见过他，并且和他成了朋友。我担心他可能会伤害她。你觉得我这样想错了吗？”

She shakes he head, "No, not at all. I… think if I was in your position I'd feel the same way. With what he did it's understandable that you would feel that way, I was… apprehensive about Kaworu at first but I had to put that aside for my job and because of that I could get to know him properly."  
她摇了摇头，“不，一点也没错。我……如果我处在你的位置，我也会有同样的感受。考虑到他所做的事，你能这样想是可以理解的。我一开始对渚薰也有些疑虑，但为了工作，我不得不把这些放在一边，正因为如此，我才能真正了解他。”

"I see…" I finish what is left in my cup, "I just do not want my friend to be hurt, nor would I want Shinji to be hurt should Kaworu come back into his life."  
“我明白了……”我喝完杯中剩下的东西，“我只是不想我的朋友受到伤害，也不希望真嗣在渚薰重新进入他的生活时受到伤害。”

"Of course. If you can… perhaps you should try talking to Kaworu yourself. Get him to explain what happened and see if that will help you feel better."  
"当然。如果你能……或许你应该亲自和渚薰谈谈。让他解释发生了什么，看看这是否能让你感觉好些。"

"Perhaps…" "或许……"

I take a moment to think about it, perhaps I do need to speak to Nagisa to understand him more. Did we all not do bad things over that time period? I myself was guilty of a great many things, I myself knew what the Commanders plans were and I could have helped stop it at any time but I did not until the last moment. Myself and Kaworu… we are similar but I hate to admit that fact because I do not like facing the idea that I myself could have been a bad person, it is easier for me to pretend my life started when I emerged and what happened before was under the control of one man.  
我花了一点时间思考，也许我真的需要和渚谈谈，以更好地理解他。在那段时间里，我们不都做了坏事吗？我自己也犯下了许多罪行，我明明知道指挥官的计划，本可以随时阻止，但我没有，直到最后一刻。我和渚……我们很相似，但我讨厌承认这一点，因为我不想面对自己可能是个坏人的想法，对我来说，假装我的生活是从我出现时开始的，而之前的一切都在一个人的控制之下，这样更容易。

If I can be forgiven by Shinji and Misato and Asuka then perhaps I should be capable of forgiving Nagisa. Perhaps I should communicate with him. Perhaps he is not who I think him to be anymore and Kodama and Asuka are right.  
如果真嗣、美里和明日香能原谅我，那么或许我也应该有能力原谅渚。或许我应该与他沟通。或许他已不再是我想象中的那个人，而小玉和明日香是对的。

"Look I have to go back to work now." Kodama pulls me from my thoughts, "Give it a thought though and… still on for dinner tonight?"  
“听着，我现在得回去工作了。”小玉打断了我的思绪，“不过，考虑一下吧，还有……今晚的晚餐还去吗？”

I look up and smile, "Yes, thank you."  
我抬起头，微笑道：“是的，谢谢你。”

**14****th** **September 2021 – Early Evening – Kaworu's Apartment**  
2021 年 9 月 14 日 – 傍晚时分 – 渚薰的公寓

I read through the paragraph one final time to confirm that it sounds correct and conforms to what the publisher wanted. A little bit of extra dialogue between the main character and the AI that controls the ship was all they had requested for that section. It wasn't a bad suggestion, the relationship between the main character and the AI is an important one, especially considering the revelations about the AI later one but I worry that too much dialogue will give things away too easily for readers.  
我再次通读了这段文字，确认它听起来正确且符合出版商的要求。他们只是建议在这一部分增加一些主角和控制飞船的人工智能之间的额外对话。这个建议并不坏，主角和人工智能之间的关系至关重要，尤其是考虑到关于人工智能的后续揭示，但我担心过多的对话会让读者轻易猜到剧情。

Behind me I can hear Kaworu in the kitchen and preparing tonight's meal. I did try to suggest that we order food tonight but he was adamant that he cook something for us instead. I want along with it, still feeling somewhat guilty about nearly ruining the meal last night. From what I can smell I'm expecting a chicken curry tonight. My stomach growls in anticipation of it.  
我身后可以听到渚薰在厨房准备今晚的晚餐。我曾提议今晚点外卖，但他坚持要亲自下厨。我顺从了他的意愿，仍对昨晚差点搞砸晚餐感到有些内疚。从我闻到的味道来看，今晚可能是咖喱鸡。我的肚子已经开始期待地咕咕叫了。

I open up my e-mail client to fire off another e-mail to my publisher with the changes they needed. Hopefully that will be the last thing and I don't need to alter anything else on the book. I also make sure to include a note telling them that I am not available for interviews and also tell them a firm no to the idea of getting someone to stand in as 'Mari Makinami' in interviews and readings.  
我打开电子邮件客户端，准备向出版社发送另一封邮件，告知他们所需的修改。希望这是最后一件事，我不需要在书上做任何其他改动。我还特意附上一条备注，告诉他们我无法接受采访，并且坚决拒绝找人代替'真希波玛丽'出席访谈和朗读会的提议。

I shake my head at the ridiculousness of that request. If anyone is going to speak for me then it'll be me and not someone paid to act as me. What annoyed me more is they even started to explore what Mari Makinami looks like! They sent me some sketch of some brown-haired girl with red rimmed glasses and a massive chest. It's clear what they were going for with that one.  
我对这一荒谬的要求摇了摇头。如果有人要代表我发言，那只能是我自己，而不是某个被雇来扮演我的人。更让我恼火的是，他们甚至开始探究真希波玛丽的形象！他们发给我一张草图，画着一个棕色头发、戴着红色边框眼镜、拥有傲人胸围的女孩。很明显，他们的意图是什么。

They'll be disappointed but they can deal with it. Maybe one day I'll reveal that Mari isn't real and is actually I, the great Asuka Langley Soryu but until that time and only until that time there will be no press, no quotes and Mari remains silent and unseen.  
他们会失望的，但他们得接受现实。也许有一天，我会揭露真希波并不存在，实际上就是我，伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷，但在此之前，不会有媒体曝光，不会有引述，真希波将保持沉默，不为人所见。

I send off the e-mail and notice that I've received one from Rei some time ago. I must have been so wrapped up on my work I never noticed it come through. I also realize with some guilt that I was supposed to have contacted her earlier today. It has just turned six in the evening here which means for Rei it'll be the early hours of the morning. I could risk it, knowing what Rei is like she could still be awake but it's probably best I don't.  
我发送了电子邮件，注意到不久前收到了丽的一封。我一定是太专注于工作，以至于没注意到它的到来。我还带着一丝愧疚意识到，我本应在今天早些时候联系她的。现在刚过晚上六点，对丽来说，这将是凌晨时分。我知道丽可能会熬夜，但我最好还是别冒险。

I open up the e-mail,  
我打开了电子邮件，

_'Hello Asuka, "“你好，明日香，”_

_I received your message and I am pleased to read that everything is okay, I was concerned after your phone call yesterday.  
我收到了你的消息，很高兴得知一切安好，昨天你打电话后我还挺担心的。_

_As far as Shinji goes I do not think he suspected that it might have been you, it seems that the measures we put in place worked but I must admit I do not feel good about this. I feel bad for deceiving him in such a way but I understand that it is your wish that he does not know.'  
至于真嗣，我认为他并未怀疑那可能是你，看来我们采取的措施奏效了，但我必须承认，对此我并不感到好受。这样欺骗他让我感到内疚，但我知道这是你的意愿，不想让他知道。_

I feel a tightening in my chest at reading that last paragraph. I feel guilty as well about it, I don't want to put Rei in that position and I know it's hurting him. It should only just be for a little while longer though. I'll... I'll contact him Rei.  
读到最后一段，我感到胸口一阵紧缩。对此我也感到愧疚，我不想让绫波陷入这种境地，我知道这会伤害他。不过，应该只需要再坚持一小段时间。我会……我会联系他的，绫波。

_'For contacting me, unfortunately I am not going to be in this evening so it would probably be better if you contacted me tomorrow. I will message you with a safe time to do so. I am glad to hear that you are well.  
“联系我时，很遗憾今晚我不在家，所以可能还是明天再联系我比较好。我会给你发个安全的时间。很高兴听到你一切安好。”_

_Also, I feel I should apologize for my actions when you told me about your friendship with Nagisa. Whilst I am still apprehensive about him and will likely remain so until I am certain he can cause no harm to you or my brother I appreciate that you might have a different perspective having spoken to him directly and spent time with him.  
“另外，我觉得应该为上次你提到与渚的友谊时我的反应道歉。虽然我对他仍心存疑虑，可能要等到我确信他不会对你或我弟弟造成伤害时才会消除，但我理解你与他直接交谈并相处后可能有不同的看法。”_

_If I have angered you in any way when speaking about him then I apologize for that as well.  
“如果我在谈论他时有什么冒犯之处，我也为此道歉。”_

_I will speak to you tomorrow.  
我明天会和你说话。_

_Rei_

(")-(")o

I ready myself to write a reply to her when Kaworu suddenly announces from the kitchen that dinner is ready.  
我正准备给她回信，这时 Kaworu 突然从厨房宣布晚餐准备好了。

"No problem, let me just…" I look up whilst speaking and see his big dumb smiling face beaming at me and then I gaze over towards the table where I see he has already set out two plates. I let out a laugh and shake my head, "Never mind, it can wait."  
“没问题，让我先……”我边说边抬头，看到他那张傻笑的大脸正对着我，然后我望向餐桌，发现他已经摆好了两副餐具。我忍不住笑出声，摇了摇头，“算了，不急。”

The laptop screen gets folded down and the device itself placed onto his coffee table before I get up and make my way over the table. I sit myself down and Kaworu takes a seat opposite me. I look down at my plate and just as I guessed it is indeed a simple chicken curry. My mouth starts to water at the sight of it and I look up to see Kaworu is looking at me expectantly. He catches me eye and quickly looks down at his own plate.  
笔记本屏幕被合上，设备放在他的咖啡桌上，我起身走向餐桌。我坐下后，Kaworu 坐在我对面。我低头看着盘子，果然如我所料，是一份简单的鸡肉咖喱。看到它，我的口水都快流出来了，抬头一看，Kaworu 正期待地看着我。他注意到我的目光，迅速低头看向自己的盘子。

I smile to myself as I mix up some of the rice with the sauce and scoop it onto my fork along with a good sized piece of chicken. Just as with the meal last this this too is incredibly tasty and I start to feel like I could get used to the idea of Kaworu cooking for me.  
我暗自微笑，将一些米饭与酱汁混合，用叉子舀起一大块鸡肉。正如上次那顿饭一样，这顿也极其美味，我开始觉得能习惯由渚为我做饭的想法。

I'm barely haflway through my first mouthful before I hear Kaworu speak, "Is it to your liking?"  
我刚吃到一半，就听到渚开口问道：“合你口味吗？”

I shoot him a glare as I try to finish my mouthful of food, I swallow and nod, "It is delicious."  
我瞪了他一眼，试图咽下嘴里的食物，然后点头说：“非常美味。”

Kaworu breathes a sigh of relief and then starts to eat from his plate too. I simple shake my head and let out a laugh as I see an embarrassed smile creep onto his lips.  
カヲルは安堵の息をつき、それから自分の皿からも食べ始めます。私はただ頭を振り、彼の唇にこっそりと浮かぶ恥ずかしい笑顔を見て笑います。



He nods, "I know how it works for sandwiches but I was unsure how it worked in context of this meal. I… forgot to research that part."  
他点点头，“我知道三明治怎么吃，但不确定这种餐点该怎么处理。我……忘了研究这部分。”

I continue to laugh, "Well it's not like there are any rules to it you idiot! Just rip it off and dip it in your food or whatever."  
我继续笑着说，“又没有什么规则，你这傻瓜！直接撕下来蘸着吃就行了。”

"Oh I see…" He tentatively rips apart a piece of the bread, "I was also uncertain about the heat of the meal as well. Is this too your liking? It is not too hot?"  
“哦，我明白了……”他小心翼翼地撕下一块面包，“我还对这餐的温度不太确定。你觉得合适吗？不会太热吧？”

"Kaworu..." I speak sternly, "It's good. I've got a pretty high tolerance when it comes to hot food anyway. Besides it should be you who is more concerned with that with it being your first curry, how is it for you?""  
"カヲル..." 我严肃地说，"很好。我对辣食的耐受度本来就挺高的。再说，既然这是你第一次吃咖喱，你应该更关心自己的感受，你觉得怎么样？""

Kaworu nods, "It is good although I will admit the sensation of heat is something I am unused to but I am sure I will adapt to it over time."  
カヲル点头道，"确实不错，不过我得承认这种热辣的感觉我还不太习惯，但我相信随着时间的推移我会适应的。"

"Well you picked a good curry to start with, some of them would probably kill you." I joke but see him look at me with a horrified expression.  
"嗯，你选了个不错的咖喱开始尝试，有些咖喱可能会要了你的命。" 我开玩笑地说，却看到他一脸惊恐地看着我。"

"Really? A curry can do that."  
"真的吗？咖喱能做到那个？"

"No not really!" I shake my head, "It'd probably be really unpleasant though."  
"不，不是真的！" 我摇摇头，"不过那肯定会非常不舒服。"

"Oh… Good, I think… I will avoid that sort of thing all the same."  
"哦……好吧，我想……我还是尽量避免那种事情吧。"

"A wise decision." I smile and we resume eating our meals in a comfortable silence. I reach over to get a drink, another bottle of wine from Kaworu's fridge that he has gotten out. This is another white wine, a Spanish wine this time, whatever that means. It tastes good though.  
“明智的决定。” 我微笑着，我们继续在舒适的沉默中用餐。我伸手去拿饮料，另一瓶从 Kaworu 冰箱里拿出的葡萄酒。这次是西班牙白葡萄酒，虽然我不太懂这意味着什么，但味道确实不错。

I have to admit Kaworu has done well with the two meals he has cooked so far, I'm quite surprised how someone who has only been properly human for less than a year and never had to cook before is able to do this. I guess he's had little choice but to do it though.  
我不得不承认 Kaworu 在烹饪这两顿饭方面做得很好，我很惊讶一个正式成为人类不到一年、之前从未需要做饭的人能做到这样。我想他别无选择，只能这么做。

As we continue to eat a strange thought suddenly enters my head. It's something I haven't actually realized until now but Kaworu is eating meat. In fact this is not the first time, he has had it on a number of occasions since I've met him. Yet I thought with him technically being the same as Rei he too would be unable to eat meat like her.  
我们继续吃饭时，一个奇怪的想法突然闯入我的脑海。我直到现在才意识到，Kaworu 在吃肉。事实上，这不是第一次，自从我认识他以来，他已经多次吃过肉。然而，我以为从技术上讲，他和 Rei 是一样的，他也会像她一样不能吃肉。

"Kaworu… Can I ask something?"  
"渚薰…我能问个问题吗？"

"Of course." He replies after sipping from his wine glass.  
""当然可以。"" 他啜饮了一口红酒后回答道。

"This might seem strange but… Why is it that you are able to eat meat?" I ask.  
""这可能听起来有点奇怪，但是…为什么你能吃肉呢？"" 我问道。

"I do not understand." He looks at me curiously.  
"我不明白。" 他好奇地看着我。

"It's just… You and Rei are similar right?" I wait for him to nod, "She can't eat meat but you can, why is that?"  
"只是……你和丽很相似对吧？" 我等待他点头，"她不能吃肉但你却可以，这是为什么？"

"Oh, that would be…" Kaworu looks up and shakes his head sadly, "I believe that is due to the way in which we were created."  
"哦，那应该是……" 薰抬头，悲伤地摇了摇头，"我想那是因为我们被创造的方式不同。"

"Explain." "解释一下。"

"You are right that myself and Rei are similar, we were both created from a human doner and supplanted with the soul of one of the seeds of life. In my case it was Adam and her case Lilith. I do not believe that Rei Ayanami's creation was as smooth as mine was, she was created from the scavenged DNA of Yui Ikari whilst my donor was in a stronger and more complete position."  
"你说的没错，我和丽确实相似，我们都是由人类捐赠者的身体创造出来的，并植入了生命之种的灵魂。我的情况是亚当，而她的是莉莉丝。我不认为绫波丽的创造过程像我一样顺利，她是用碇唯的 DNA 碎片拼凑而成的，而我的捐赠者则处于更强大、更完整的状态。"

"Who was your donor?" I ask him.  
""你的捐赠者是谁？"" 我问他。

"I do not know, it is not information that I was ever granted access to nor did I seek it out. I do not know if that person lives nor do I know if they were even aware that they were a donor. Knowing SEELE I would doubt both things, they disliked loose ends."  
"我不知道，这不是我曾被授权访问的信息，我也没有去寻找。我不知道那个人是否还活着，也不知道他们是否知道自己曾是捐赠者。考虑到 SEELE，我怀疑这两点，他们不喜欢未解决的问题。"

Kaworu pauses for a moment to sip from his wine again, "With my creation there was an entire team of people working around the clock to ensure my body was kept fit and healthy. I was attended to at all times by the best doctors and scientists in the world. I do not believe Rei would have been… as fortunate as I was."  
渚薰停顿了一下，再次啜饮他的葡萄酒，"我的创造过程中，有一整个团队昼夜不停地工作，确保我的身体保持健康。我随时都有世界上最好的医生和科学家照料。我不认为绫波会像我一样幸运。"

I bow my head slightly as I recall the various stories I heard about Rei's so-called upbringing. I never saw any of it for myself but I have heard of the place where she lived. I heard Rei and the others speak about how it was in some abandoned part of Tokyo-3, how it had walls that were damp and rotting away and it was unpopulated aside from the unfortunate homeless of Tokyo-3 and a myriad of rats.  
我微微低头，回忆起听过的关于绫波所谓的成长的各种故事。我从未亲眼见过，但我听说过她居住的地方。我听绫波和其他人谈论过，那是在第三新东京市的一个废弃区域，墙壁潮湿腐烂，除了不幸的第三新东京市的无家可归者和无数的鼠群，那里空无一人。

I once called her the Commander's favourite. I looked at her with envy believing that she lived a life of luxury and praise. That because she had the Commander's attention she had everything that I thought I wanted. How wrong was I? How awful must I have sounded when I said those things to her?  
我曾称她为指挥官的宠儿。我带着嫉妒的目光看她，以为她过着奢华和赞誉的生活。因为得到了指挥官的关注，她拥有了我认为我想要的一切。我错得有多离谱？当我对她说过那些话时，我听起来一定很糟糕吧？

"No… She really wasn't…" I finally mutter.  
“不……她真的不是……”我终于低声说道。

"All of these additional resources meant that… my human vessel was stronger than that of Ayanami's. SEELE thought I necessary to minimize weakness as best they could for me to carry out their goals."  
“所有这些额外的资源意味着……我的人类躯体比绫波的更强。SEELE 认为我必须尽可能减少弱点，以便我能执行他们的目标。”

"I see…" I prod a piece of chicken with my fork before stabbing it angrily and shoving it into my mouth.  
"我明白了…" 我用叉子戳了戳一块鸡肉，然后愤怒地刺穿它，猛地塞进嘴里。

"SEELE made an effort to suppress my humanity. They wanted their vessel strong but wanted to keep my humanity at bay except for where it would benefit them. They would remind me constantly of what I was and what I had been put on this earth to do. They wanted me to be unable to resist the call on that day."  
"SEELE 努力压制我的人性。他们希望他们的容器强大，但又想将我的人性控制在对他们有利的地方。他们不断提醒我我是谁，以及我被赋予这个世界的使命。他们希望我无法抗拒那一天的召唤。"

"You meant the day you betra-" I catch myself before I finish the word but I can see still the spark of sadness in his eyes, "I'm sorry… I didn't mean to."  
"你是说你被背叛的那天——" 我及时打住，但仍能看到他眼中闪过的悲伤，"对不起…我不是故意的。"

Kaworu simply shakes his head, "No… That is what it was, it was a betrayal. I betrayed my only friend because I was unable to resist my own urges. I was unable to spot the lies in front of me and gave into the desire to reunite with the being known as Adam."  
渚薰只是摇了摇头，“不……那就是它，那是一种背叛。我背叛了我唯一的朋友，因为我无法抗拒自己的欲望。我没能识破眼前的谎言，沉溺于与被称为亚当的存在重聚的渴望中。”

He tears off a piece of bread and dips it into his curry, "As… 'Tabris'… I always felt something calling to me. I was told what it was, that call was an answer to the pain of loneliness that I always felt. Each passing day that pain grew larger and the call grew more alluring."  
他撕下一块面包，蘸进咖喱里，“作为……‘塔布里斯’……我总感觉有什么在召唤我。我被告知那是什么，那呼唤是对我始终感受到的孤独之痛的回应。随着时间的推移，那份痛苦愈发强烈，呼唤也变得更加诱人。”

There is another brief pause as he scoops up a bit of rice with his bread, "SEELE explained it all of course. They told me of the being known as Adam and how it was waiting under Tokyo-3 for me. Not only that but they gave it a purpose, not only would it cure the pain I felt but it'd cure the world. All would be reborn and perfect!"  
他再次短暂停顿，用面包舀起一些米饭，“当然，SEELE 解释了一切。他们告诉我那个被称为亚当的存在，以及它如何在第三新东京市下等待着我。不仅如此，他们还赋予了它一个目的，不仅会治愈我感受到的痛苦，还会治愈整个世界。一切都将重生，变得完美！”

I see his expression darken as he continues, "I believed every lie they told me, so when I got to Tokyo-3 I knew what I had to do. When I was there I felt the call grow even stronger, it spoke to me, it wanted me and it only confirmed what I had been told until… I finally got to it and I saw it wasn't Adam at all. It was Lilith and in that moment… I knew the truth."  
我看到他的表情阴沉下来，继续说道：“我相信了他们告诉我的每一个谎言，所以当我到达第三新东京市时，我知道我必须做什么。在那里，我感到那种召唤变得更加强烈，它对我说话，它想要我，这只会证实我被告知的一切，直到……我终于接近了它，却发现那根本不是亚当。那是莉莉丝，在那一刻……我明白了真相。”

I rise from my seat and make my way over to him and hold him, running my hand through his soft hair, "It's okay Kaworu… I know the rest."  
我从座位上站起来，走向他并拥抱他，用手抚摸他柔软的头发，“没事的，渚薰……我知道剩下的故事。”

"There are times when I don't know if I should blame SEELE for it or if I should blame myself. I had the power within me to resist it. I could conjure an A.T. Field of such strength, my S2 Organ gave me unlimited power, I could have… I could have resisted SEELE but… I was weak to the call and their lies."  
有时候，我不知道我是否应该责怪 Seele，还是应该责怪自己。我体内有力量去抵抗它。我可以召唤出如此强大的 A.T.力场，我的 S2 机关赋予我无限的力量，我本可以……我本可以抵抗 Seele，但是……我对那种召唤和他们的谎言太软弱了。

"Stop it!" I say sharply as I continue to hold him, "There was nothing you could have done and… things worked out in the end."  
"住手！" 我严厉地说道，继续抱着他，"你无能为力，而且……最终事情还是解决了。"

"Perhaps!" He nods, "I suppose… there is little point in me thinking about that now."  
"或许吧！" 他点头，"我想……现在再想这些也没什么意义了。"

"No… No you won't." I pat him on the back and move back to my seat, as I sit back down I see Kaworu smiling at me again.  
"不……不，你不会的。" 我拍了拍他的背，回到自己的座位上，坐下时我看到渚薰再次对我微笑。"

"Thank you Asuka… for listening to me." He pauses.  
"谢谢你，明日香……愿意听我说。" 他顿了顿。

I shrug, "Don't worry about it."  
我耸耸肩，"别放在心上。"

"I… I don't know if it is appropriate but there is something I wanted to ask."  
"我……我不知道这样是否合适，但我有件事想问。"

"Go ahead." I reply to him with a mouthful of chicken and rice.  
"说吧。" 我嘴里塞满了鸡肉和米饭，回答他。

"How come you decided to come back to Germany?"  
"你怎么决定回德国的？"

"Ah."

I didn't expect him to ask me that, at least not yet. I shake my head, "It was… just something I felt I had to do to be honest. It wasn't like there was a big argument or incident I just… I couldn't be there anymore with them and I had to come back."  
我没想到他会这么快问我这个问题。我摇摇头，"老实说，我只是觉得我必须这么做。并不是因为发生了什么大争吵或事件，我只是……再也无法和他们待在一起了，我必须回来。

I pause and try to recall the day that I left.  
我停顿了一下，试图回忆起离开的那一天。

**6****th** **June 2016 - Asuka Langley Soryu**

My eyes open immediately at the sound of my alarm going off and I quickly bring my hand down to silence the device. I lie still for a few moments staring at the time, it's early, far too early for my liking and for a brief moment I contemplate rolling back over and going back to sleep. I realize however that it is simply not possible for me to do that, I'm awake this early for a reason, so instead all I can do is let out and annoyed sigh and sit up.  
闹钟一响，我的眼睛立刻睁开，迅速伸手按下设备使其静音。我静静地躺了几分钟，盯着时间，太早了，远早于我所喜欢的时刻，有那么一瞬间我考虑翻身继续睡。然而，我意识到这根本不可能，我这么早醒来是有原因的，所以我只能发出一声恼怒的叹息，然后坐起身来。

That annoyance at the situation soon fades when I reach over to turn on my lamp and see the card and wrapped up box waiting on my bedside table. Instead I feel something else, sadness? Regret? Fear? I'm not entirely sure, it's a mixture of feelings but I suppose that's to be expected.  
当我伸手去开灯，看到床头柜上那张卡片和包装好的盒子时，对情况的恼怒很快消散了。取而代之的是另一种感觉，悲伤？后悔？恐惧？我不完全确定，这是一种混合的情绪，但我想这是可以预料的。

I reach over and pick up the card and turn it over in my hand to reveal Shinji's name written, in beautiful handwriting, on the card. I shake my head as certain thoughts enter my mind.  
我伸手拿起卡片，翻转过来，看到卡片上用漂亮的笔迹写着真嗣的名字。我摇了摇头，某些念头涌入脑海。

_'You don't have to do this... You can stop it, just tell him that you changed your mind. He already said you can change your mind at any time, it wouldn't exactly be difficult.'  
'你不必这么做……你可以停下来，只要告诉他你改变了主意。他早就说过你随时可以改变主意，这并不难。'_

I put the card back down on the table and shake my head. I can't stop this, not now, it's something that I have to go through with. I can't stay in this place any longer, I just... I can't be here anymore. I just don't belong here, I don't deserve to be here with these people.  
我把卡片放回桌上，摇了摇头。我无法阻止这一切，至少现在不能，这是我必须经历的。我不能再待在这个地方了，我只是……我不能再待在这里了。我不属于这里，我不配和这些人在一起。

I know they probably feel the same, that I don't belong here with them. I can't blame them really, not after the way I've acted towards them all. Sure, it's not like I've acted like that since we all returned but that doesn't matter. They still remember and so do I and I know it's just a matter of time before that monster surfaces again.  
我知道他们可能也有同样的感觉，觉得我不属于他们。我不能怪他们，毕竟我对他们的态度如此恶劣。当然，自从我们回来后，我并没有那样表现，但这并不重要。他们仍然记得，我也记得，我知道那怪物迟早会再次浮现。

Of course, they're too polite to ask me to leave so I'm going to make it easy for them. I contacted Fuyutsuki weeks ago and arranged this. I've packed what few belongings I have and I'll leave before any of them wake up. There are just a few things I need to do first.  
当然，他们太有礼貌了，不会要求我离开，所以我要为他们省去麻烦。几周前我就联系了冬月，安排了这一切。我已经打包好我仅有的几件物品，会在他们醒来之前离开。只是还有几件事需要先处理。

I step out of the bed and look at the clock again. I need to be quick and quiet during this. Everythign has been planned out, I need to shower first then I'll get dressed before giving Shinji his gift. When that is done I'll leave and they won't need to see me again, I'll tell Fuyutsuki to let Misato know what I've done but not where I've done. It'll be better this way, if they find out they'll just try to get me to stay and... I'll probably do it.  
我下了床，再次看向时钟。我需要在这段时间里迅速而安静。一切都已计划妥当，我得先洗个澡，然后穿好衣服，再给真嗣送上礼物。完成后，我就会离开，他们也不必再见到我。我会告诉冬月让美里知道我所做的事情，但不会告诉她地点。这样会更好，如果他们发现，只会试图让我留下，而我……很可能会答应。

I slide the door to my room open as quietly as I can and slip out into the main hallway. It's only a short distance to the bathroom from here but I do need to make my way through the living room, that brings me to my first obstacle. As I enter the living room I can hear a soft snoring sound and I immediately freeze and look towards the source of the sound.  
我尽可能轻地滑开房门，悄悄溜进主走廊。从这里到浴室只有一小段距离，但我确实需要穿过客厅，这成了我的第一个障碍。当我走进客厅时，听到一阵轻微的鼾声，我立刻停下脚步，朝声音的来源望去。

I try to stifle a laugh as I see Rei lying on the sofa, or at least the hair of Rei Ayanami. Somehow, and I'm not sure how, she has managed to roll herself up in her blankets to create a perfect blanket burrito, or as I might call it a 'bureito.'  
我试图忍住笑，因为我看到丽躺在沙发上，或者至少是绫波零的头发。不知怎么的，我不确定她是怎么做到的，她竟然把自己裹在毯子里，形成了一个完美的毯子卷，或者我可能会称之为‘布雷托’。

_'No more sofa for you after today Rei, you can have that room now.'  
'从今天起，丽，你不能再睡沙发了，那个房间归你了。'_

A few brief moments later I'm in the bathroom, have disrobed and turned the shower on. As the water comes down around me my thoughts turn once more to why I'm doing this today. When were those seeds sewn of me wanting to leave? I can't really pin down an exact moment, I guess it was just a feeling I had ever since we call came back from Third Impact.  
片刻之后，我站在浴室里，脱去衣物，打开了淋浴。随着水流环绕着我，思绪再次转向今天我为何要这么做。那些让我渴望离开的种子是何时种下的？我无法确切指出一个时刻，大概是从我们所有人从第三次冲击归来后，那种感觉就一直萦绕在我心头。

Thing started off well enough. Shinji was the first person to return on that day and I was not far behind. I can still remember those initial moments on the beach when I returned. I can remember the rush of emotions, the pain and the confusion of it all. I can remember what Shinji did, or tried to do to me in his confusion and how I was able to stop him.  
事情起初还算顺利。那天，真嗣是第一个回来的，而我紧随其后。我至今仍记得刚回到海滩时的那些瞬间。我记得那些情感的涌动，痛苦与混乱交织。我记得真嗣在混乱中对我所做或试图做的事，以及我是如何阻止他的。

I can remember how he sat there and cried when he realized what it was he was doing and how afterwards we lay in silence just holding one another. We even spoke to one another after it, we actually had a proper and decent conversation. I told him things about my life, about my mother and my upbringing and he told me about his. It was nice, it was cathartic and it felt right.  
我记得他当时坐在那里，意识到自己在做什么时哭了，之后我们静静地躺着，只是互相拥抱着。甚至在事后，我们还彼此交谈，进行了一次真正体面的对话。我向他讲述了我的生活，我的母亲和我的成长经历，他也向我倾诉了他的故事。那感觉很好，是一种宣泄，也感觉对了。

Of course, that feeling couldn't last. Barely a day later Misato returned and soon afterwards Rei turned up before more and more people came back. There was no more talking after that, there was no more holding one another and there was barely any communication. Shinji had Misato and Rei to confide in now, he had his family back and I... Well I've never had a family, Misato tried to make me feel welcome but I'd already burned those bridges, hadn't I? So, it never felt right.  
当然，那种感觉无法持久。不到一天，美里回来了，不久后丽也出现了，越来越多的人陆续返回。从那以后，我们再也没有交谈，再也没有互相拥抱，几乎没有任何交流。真嗣现在有美里和丽可以倾诉，他找回了家人，而我...我从未有过家人，美里试图让我感到欢迎，但我已经烧毁了那些桥梁，不是吗？所以，那种感觉从未对过。

Soon afterwards we fell into routines. Shinji became more withdrawn as more people came back, he won't venture out of the apartment and is terrified of anyone knowing who he is. I spend most of my time outside the apartment going on long walks and avoiding people.  
不久之后，我们陷入了日常。随着越来越多的人回来，真嗣变得更加孤僻，他不敢走出公寓，害怕任何人知道他的身份。我大部分时间都在公寓外长时间散步，避开人群。

Rei... Rei actually went back to school as soon as she could. It's strange but she has grown so much from the girl she used to be. She is still quiet but you can see a spark of humanity in her that wasn't there before. She speaks about what she wants to do in the future, of places she wants to go and things she'd like to see.  
丽...丽其实一能动就回学校了。虽然奇怪，但她已经从过去的那个女孩成长了许多。她依然沉默寡言，但你能看到她眼中闪烁着以前没有的人性光芒。她谈及自己未来的打算，想去的地方和想见的事物。

As far as my future goes... I've thought about it but what sort of future does someone like me have? Shinji... Rei... Misato, they all have a chance, they're all heroes and can do whatever they want but me? I'm little more than nothing. I'm the girl who lost, I'm the girl who failed, the girl who had the potential but squandered it all. I'm the monster who did nothing but hurt others.  
至于我的未来...我曾思考过，但像我这样的人会有什么样的未来呢？真嗣...丽...美里，他们都有机会，都是英雄，可以做任何想做的事，而我呢？我几乎什么都不是。我是那个失败者，是那个失败了的女孩，拥有潜力却挥霍一空。我是那个只会伤害他人的怪物。

I'm the one who screamed and yelled because she couldn't get her own way. I'm the one who turned everyone away who tried to help. What does the future hold for someone like me? All I'm capable of is hurting other people. Everyone here knows it too. They think I don't notice it but I can see and feel their eyes on me when I walk around this town. I know how Misato and Rei look at me, I know they're terrified that I'll hurt Shinji and I don't blame them. I've done it once so why not again?  
我就是那个因为得不到自己想要的东西而尖叫怒吼的人。我就是那个把所有试图帮助我的人都拒之门外的人。像我这样的人，未来会怎样呢？我所能做的只是伤害别人。这里的每个人都知道这一点。他们以为我没注意到，但我能感觉到他们在镇上走动时投在我身上的目光。我知道美里和绫波怎么看我，我知道他们害怕我会伤害真嗣，我不怪他们。我曾这样做过一次，那为什么不会再做一次呢？

_'Because you aren't that person anymore, you don't shout or yell anymore. You don't need to be like that...'  
“因为你不再是那个人了，你不再大喊大叫了。你不需要那样……”_

It's a nice thought that passes through my mind but what if it isn't true? Besides, even if I'm not that person anymore it doesn't erase the person I was and the person they think I am. I'd rather save the others the hassle of having to tip toe around be because they're frightened. I just hope they all go forward to have a happy life, they deserve it.  
这个想法很美好，但它可能是真的吗？再者，即使我不再是那个人，也无法抹去我曾经的模样和他们心目中的我。我宁愿让其他人免于因害怕而不得不小心翼翼地对待我。我只希望他们都能向前迈进，拥有幸福的生活，他们值得拥有。

I turn the shower off and wrap a towel around myself. I slip out of the bathroom and once more past the bureito lying on the sofa. Within moments I'm back in my room and drying off. I hastily throw my clothes on and grab the gift and card. This is the last thing I need to do, probably the most difficult task.  
我关掉淋浴，用毛巾裹住自己。悄悄走出浴室，再次经过躺在沙发上的武士。片刻后，我回到房间开始擦干身体。匆忙穿上衣服，拿起礼物和卡片。这是最后一件需要做的事，可能也是最困难的任务。

I take those few careful steps to Shinji's door and slide it open as quietly as I can. I take a feep breath to steady my nerves before stepping into his room. It's dark, save for a thin slither of light coming in through a crack in his curtains. The light is providing just enough illumination for me to see him lying on his bed. He's facing away from me, good, that'll make this easier.  
我小心翼翼地走到真嗣的门前，尽可能轻地拉开它。深吸一口气稳定情绪，然后踏入他的房间。除了窗帘缝隙透进的一丝光线外，房间里很暗。这微弱的光线足以让我看到他躺在床上。他背对着我，很好，这样会容易些。

I silently approach the side of the bed and place the gift and card down on his bedside table before kneeling next to the bed.  
我悄无声息地走到床边，将礼物和卡片放在他的床头柜上，然后跪在床边。

"Shinji..." I whisper to him, "I'm... I'm leaving. I don't know how long I'm going for, it might be a short amount of time or it might be forever but please... promise me you won't look for me okay."  
“真嗣……” 我轻声对他说，“我……我要离开了。我不知道会去多久，可能是短暂的时光，也可能是一辈子，但请你……答应我，不要来找我，好吗？”

I let out a sigh, "I... I just... I don't deserve to be here with you guys. You're all good people but me... I'm not, I was horrible to you all, I was a monster and... I know we should be leaving that in the past but I can't. I think about who I was every day and I just can't forget that. I just... I wanted to see you one last time and maybe do something nice for you."  
我叹了口气，“我……我只是……我不配和你们在一起。你们都是好人，而我……我不是，我对你们都很糟糕，我是个怪物，而且……我知道我们应该把那些留在过去，但我做不到。我每天都在想过去的自己，我无法忘记。我只是……想再见你一面，也许为你做点好事。”

I pause as I feel the stinging of tears in my eyes, I bring up a hand to wipe the tear away and continue to speak to him, my whispering voice trembling as I do so, "Today is your birthday isn't it? I got you a card and a gift, I hope you like it. I got you a new music player, I know you lost your old one and I know you loved it so... I wanted to get you something nice. I also... put some money in the card too, so get yourself something nice with it. Some new shirts to replace the white ones you always have or a nice cake."  
我停顿了一下，感觉到眼眶中的泪水刺痛，抬起手擦去泪水，继续颤抖着低声对他说，“今天是你的生日，对吧？我给你准备了一张卡片和一份礼物，希望你会喜欢。我给你买了一个新的音乐播放器，我知道你弄丢了旧的那个，而且我知道你很喜欢它……所以我想给你买些好东西。我还……在卡片里放了一些钱，这样你可以用它买些好东西。比如换掉你常穿的白衬衫，或者买个美味的蛋糕。”

I pause again and smile, "I'm sorry for everything I did Shinji. I never meant to hurt you or anyone else like I did. I just hope you know that I never meant it when I said I hated you, I always liked... no... I always loved you Shinji, I still do and... maybe I always will but I just can't be here anymore so... goodbye Shinji and... Happy Birthday."  
我再次停顿，微笑着说：“我对所做的一切向你道歉，真嗣。我从没想过要伤害你或任何人。我只是希望你知道，当我说的那些讨厌你的话时，我从未真心那么想，我一直喜欢……不……我一直爱着你，真嗣，现在依然如此……也许我会一直爱下去，但我不能再留在这里了……所以，再见，真嗣，还有……生日快乐。”

With those final words I quickly turn around and leave his room. I rush back into my room blinking furiously and bringing my hands up to my eyes to wipe away any tears that threaten to run down my cheeks. I quickly grab my case and head back out into the hallway towards the front door. I slip my feet into my shoes and open the front door as quietly as I can.  
说完这些最后的告别，我迅速转身离开他的房间。我冲回自己的房间，用力眨眼，抬起手来擦去眼角即将滑落的泪水。我迅速抓起行李箱，走出房间，沿着走廊向大门走去。我悄悄地穿上鞋子，尽可能轻地打开前门。

As I step out a cool breeze hits my cheeks and I turn to see the solemn figure of Kozo Fuyutsuki.  
当我踏出门外，一阵凉风吹拂过我的脸颊，我转身看到了神情肃穆的 Kozo Fuyutsuki。

"Fuyutsuki." I nod towards him.  
"冬月。" 我向他点头示意。

"So, you're actually leaving? You don't want to change your mind?" He asks me.  
"所以，你真的要走？不想改变主意吗？" 他问我。

"Yes." I confirm without hesitation, "Let's get this over and done with."  
"是的。" 我毫不犹豫地确认，"让我们尽快解决这件事。"
