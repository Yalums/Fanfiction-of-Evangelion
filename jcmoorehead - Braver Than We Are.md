**January 11****th** **2021**  2021 年 1 月 11 日

**Tokyo 3 Outskirts - Early Morning  
第三新东京市郊外 - 清晨**

There is a bright flash of light and I suddenly become aware of my surroundings. I'm underwater, swimming in a dark red liquid. I feel panic within me as I hold my breath and swim towards the surface as quick as I can. My limbs feel as if they're on fire as I finally reach the surface of the water and gasp for air.  
一道耀眼的光芒闪过，我突然意识到自己身处的环境。我在水下，游动在一片暗红色的液体中。我感到一阵恐慌，屏住呼吸，尽可能快地向水面游去。我的四肢仿佛在燃烧，当我终于到达水面时，我大口喘息着。

I float on the surface for a few moments taking in my surroundings. Off in the distance I see the land, without hesitating I start to swim towards it as fast as my aching body will take me. As I move a sickening smell infiltrates my nostrils, my mind registers what this foul copper-like smell is.  
我在水面上漂浮了一会儿，观察四周。远处我看到了陆地，毫不犹豫地开始向它游去，尽我疼痛的身体所能达到的最快速度。随着我的移动，一股令人作呕的气味侵入我的鼻孔，我的脑海中浮现出这股恶臭的铜质气味的来源。

Blood... Am I swimming in blood? I try not to think about it. Survival and getting out of this liquid is the priority. I move forward and my mind informs me that swimming has never been one of my strengths. It was something I was capable of but never enjoyed or excelled at. Fortunately, that doesn't seem to matter as I reach the land.  
血...我是在血中游泳吗？我尽量不去想这件事。生存和逃离这片液体是首要任务。我继续前进，我的意识告诉我，游泳从来不是我的强项。虽然我能做到，但从未喜欢过或擅长过。幸运的是，这似乎并不重要，因为我最终到达了陆地。

I'm thankful for the sensation of the soft sand beneath my naked feet as I take a few slow and careful steps out of the water. Every part of my body hurts and I again find myself thankful for the sand being there to cushion me as I fall forward. Some of it flies up into my face and mouth, I try to spit it out before rolling onto my back and simply lying there for a few moments to catch my breath.  
我感激地感受着赤脚踏在柔软沙地上的触感，缓缓而小心翼翼地走出水面。全身每一处都在疼痛，再次庆幸有沙子作为缓冲，当我向前跌倒时。一些沙粒飞溅到我的脸上和嘴里，我试图吐出它们，然后翻过身来，只是躺在那里片刻，喘口气。

I can now feel the water lapping at my bare feet and the hems of my trousers. I can still smell the blood-like smell of the liquid and in my weakened state I prop myself up onto my elbows and try to shift away from the liquid. Above me the sky is a brilliant blue, the sun shining down on me and there is a gentle but cool breeze in the air.  
现在我能感觉到水轻拍着我赤裸的双脚和裤脚。我仍能闻到那液体类似血的气味，在我虚弱的状态下，我用手肘撑起自己，试图远离那液体。头顶上的天空是明亮的蓝色，阳光照耀着我，空气中有一股轻柔而凉爽的微风。

I look down at myself. I'm barefoot and wearing a pair of black trousers, this is accompanied by a white button-up shirt that is currently open revealing a tattered orange t-shirt. I look up from myself to the rest of my surroundings. Ahead of me I see the pool I emerged from, it's an incredibly large body of water coloured a deep blood red. The smell of it makes me feel sick but I can see that it is not blood as I feared.  
我低头看着自己。我赤着脚，穿着一条黑色裤子，搭配着一件敞开的白色扣衫，露出了破烂的橙色 T 恤。我从自己身上抬起目光，环顾四周。在我前方，我看到了我刚从那里出来的水池，它是一个巨大无比的水体，呈现出深血红色。它的气味让我感到恶心，但我能看出那并不是我担心的血液。

I look around and some additional monuments catch my eye. I feel rising out of the water a number of large strange statues. They're posed in cross like forms, their arms stretching out wide. I shudder at the sight of them. There is something eerily familiar about them, something familiar and terrifying. I dislike this feeling and turn my head away not wishing to see them any longer.  
我环顾四周，一些额外的纪念碑吸引了我的目光。我感觉到从水中升起了许多巨大而奇异的雕像。它们以十字形姿态排列，双臂向外伸展。看到它们，我不禁打了个寒颤。这些雕像有种诡异的熟悉感，既熟悉又可怕。我不喜欢这种感觉，于是转过头去，不再想看到它们。

'Where am I?' I ask myself as I take another look around, trying to avoid looking at the statues. As I look around I see other things that catch my eye and seem so familiar to me. I see the remains of buildings sticking up out of the water and I wonder exactly what happened here. What cause all of this to happen and why am I here now?  
'我在哪里？' 我自问，再次环顾四周，试图避开那些雕像。当我四处张望时，我看到了其他吸引我眼球的东西，它们对我来说似乎非常熟悉。我看到水面上矗立着的建筑残骸，不禁好奇这里究竟发生了什么。是什么导致了这一切的发生，而我此刻又为何会在这里？

I try to cast my mind back to what happened before I emerged from that pool. I try to remember what happened to me before that bright flash of light. It's at this moment I feel my stomach drop and little pangs of panic rise up inside me.  
我试图回想起从那个水池中出现之前发生的事情。我努力回忆在那道耀眼的光芒之前我经历了什么。就在这时，我感到胃部一阵下沉，内心涌起了些许恐慌的刺痛。

I... I can't remember. I can't... remember anything before that flash of light. I don't know what happened before it, I don't know... I don't know who I am!  
我...我记不起来了。在那道闪光之前的一切...我都...想不起来。我不知道闪光之前发生了什么，我不知道...我不知道自己是谁！

"Who am I?" “我是谁？”

I speak the words aloud hoping that maybe hearing the sound of my own voice might trigger something inside of me.  
我大声说出这些话，希望也许听到自己的声音能在我内心触发些什么。

It doesn't. Instead I feel more pangs of panic inside my stomach and I feel sicker than before. I don't know who I am! I don't know my name, where I came from, why I'm here or anything. No matter how much I try to remember, I'm just drawing a blank.  
它没有。相反，我感到胃里一阵阵恐慌的刺痛，比之前更加恶心。我不知道自己是谁！我不知道我的名字，我从哪里来，为什么在这里，或者任何事情。无论我怎么努力回忆，脑子里只是一片空白。

I get myself onto my knees and crawl forward towards the water. Pain shoots through my body with each movement but I try to shrug it off. I can't stop... I... I have to know.  
我让自己跪起来，向前爬向水边。每一次移动都让身体疼痛不已，但我试图忽视它。我不能停下来...我...我必须要知道。

"Who... Who Am I?" “我...我是谁？”

I say the words again as I get closer to the water. I look down at it hoping to see some sort of reflection. Some sort of clue as to who I am but the water is too dark to reflect anything for me to see.  
我再次说出这些话，当我走近水边。我低头望向水面，希望能看到某种倒影。希望能找到关于我是谁的线索，但水太黑了，什么也映不出来。

"Who am I!" “我是谁！”

I ask again as I bring my hand down into the water in frustration. I feel the droplets splash up onto my face.  
我再次问道，同时沮丧地将手伸入水中。我感觉到水滴溅到脸上。

"Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?"  
"我是谁？我是谁？我是谁？"

I keep asking and with each time I ask I bring a hand down into the water. I'm vaguely aware of a sound from behind me but I don't care to turn around and see what it is. All that matters to me is trying to find an answer to who I am. I dislike this. I hate this. I'm terrified of this. I need to know. I need to know!  
我不断追问，每一次提问，我都将手浸入水中。我隐约听到身后有声响，但我无意转身去看。对我来说，最重要的是试图找到我是谁的答案。我不喜欢这样。我讨厌这样。我对此感到恐惧。我需要知道。我需要知道！

"Who! Am! I!" "谁！是！我！"

I ask again as both hands come down, more water splashed up onto me as I hear another sound. It sounds like something slamming and moments later it's accompanied by the sound of footsteps. I don't turn around, I find myself frozen with fear as I wait for them to approach. The sound stops and I hear a voice, that of a young woman.  
我再次问道，双手落下时，更多的水溅到了我身上，同时我听到了另一种声音。那声音像是有什么东西猛地撞击，片刻后伴随着脚步声。我没有转身，发现自己因恐惧而僵住，等待着他们靠近。声音停止了，我听到了一个年轻女子的声音。

"Go and contact headquarters, tell them they were right and we have another survivor. Get them to prepare one of the rooms. I'll deal with this."  
“去联系总部，告诉他们我们猜对了，还有另一个幸存者。让他们准备一个房间。我来处理这里。”

I still don't turn around but I'm fairly sure one of the others has turned and went away. I remain still as I hear the woman start to walk towards me. She stops a metre or two away from me and I slowly turn myself around.  
我依然没有转身，但我相当确定其中一人已经转身离开。我保持静止，听着那女子开始向我走来。她在离我一两米远的地方停下，我慢慢地转过身来。

She is looking at me somewhat cautiously, perhaps the way someone might approach an animal they were unsure of. She kneels slowly and I take the time to look at her properly. She is a young woman with long brown hair done up in a ponytail. She is wearing a uniform that I don't recognize. Her expression seems warm and friendly but also cautious.  
她正有些谨慎地看着我，或许就像人们接近一只不确定的动物时的那种方式。她慢慢地跪下，我趁机仔细打量她。她是一位年轻女子，长长的棕色头发扎成马尾。她穿着一套我不认识的制服。她的表情显得温暖而友好，但也带着谨慎。

"Don't be afraid. We're here to help you." She finally says in a warm tone.  
“别害怕。我们是来帮你的。”她终于用温暖的语气说道。

"Who... Who am I?" I ask weakly, "I... I don't... I don't remember... anything."  
“我...我是谁？”我虚弱地问道，“我...我不...我不记得...任何事情。”

She takes a few steps forward and kneels down in front of me. She places a warm hand on my shoulder and rubs gently, "It'll be alright, it's a side effect of the emergence. In time you'll be fine, we're going to take you back to a safe place. Is that alright?"  
她向前走了几步，跪在我面前。她将温暖的手放在我的肩上，轻轻揉搓，“一切都会好起来的，这是觉醒的副作用。过段时间你就会没事的，我们会带你去一个安全的地方。这样可以吗？”

I nod weakly at her. I don't know what she means by emergence but I feel like I can trust her.  
我虚弱地点了点头。我不知道她所说的觉醒是什么意思，但我感觉可以信任她。

"Good. Can you stand?" “很好。你能站起来吗？”

I nod again, "I-I think so."  
我再次点头，“我——我想是的。”

She gets to her feet and extends a hand towards me. I reach out and take it and she helps me to my feet. My body still aches and I stumble forward slightly but she is there to catch me. She puts my arm around her shoulders and helps guide me towards a waiting vehicle and her colleague. I remain silent as I'm helped into the back of the vehicle as she takes a radio from him.  
她站起身来，向我伸出手。我伸出手握住，她扶我站起来。我的身体依然疼痛，微微踉跄了一下，但她及时扶住了我。她把我的手臂搭在她的肩膀上，引导我走向一辆等待的车辆和她的一位同事。我默默地被扶进车后座，她则从他那里接过一个无线电。

"Team 2-A reporting in, I have one survivor. Male, late teens and showing some signs of emergence sickness. Will need a doctor on standby for when we return."  
“2-A 小队报告，我这里有一名幸存者。男性，十几岁，表现出一些觉醒病症的迹象。返回时需要医生待命。”

I hear the voice on the other side come through clearly, _"A survivor? Been quite a while since the last one. We've got a room ready as we speak and I'll let the medical team know to be on standby. Anything else to report?"_  
我清晰地听到电话那头传来的声音，“幸存者？距离上一个已经很久了。我们这边已经准备好了房间，我会通知医疗团队随时待命。还有什么要报告的吗？”

"Nothing, it's all quiet out here. Will see you shortly."  
“没有，这里一切都很安静。我们很快见。”

The two of them climb into the vehicle properly and close the door. I look around and bring the belt around me and clip it in. It's strange that I can't remember who I am but I know to do this. As the car moves away I begin to wonder who these people are and what this emergence sickness was they mentioned.  
他们两人正式上了车并关上门。我环顾四周，拉过安全带扣好。奇怪的是，我不记得自己是谁，但我知道该这么做。随着车子驶离，我开始思考这些人是谁，以及他们提到的这种突发疾病是什么。

After a minute or so the man in the car turns himself around, he is about the same age as the girl.  
大约一分钟后，车里的男人转过身来，他和女孩年纪相仿。

"Our facility is only about ten minutes away from here." He tells me, "You know, you're the first person we've seen emerge in quite some time. We thought that all who were going to return had already returned by now."  
“我们的设施离这儿只有大约十分钟的路程。”他告诉我，“你知道吗，你是我们很久以来见到的第一个出现的人。我们以为所有要回来的人都已经回来了。”

I look at him in confusion not really knowing what he is talking about. All I can do is nod my head and immediately he seems to recognize my confusion.  
我困惑地看着他，不太明白他在说什么。我只能点点头，他似乎立刻察觉到了我的困惑。

"Sorry, I guess you probably don't have a clue what I'm talking about do you?"  
"抱歉，我猜你可能完全不知道我在说什么，对吧？"

I shake my head, "I am sorry."  
我摇摇头，"我很抱歉。"

"No need to apologize." He says to me, "it's the emergence sickness. It affects most of us when we come out. Tend to draw a complete blank as to who we are and what happened before. It'll pass tough, it always does!"  
"无需道歉。" 他对我說，"这是出现症状。我们大多数人出来时都会受到影响。往往会完全忘记自己是谁以及之前发生了什么。不过它会过去的，总是如此！"

I feel somewhat reassured by his words but that little feeling of dread is still hanging there. I resist the urge to ask questions like, 'what if it doesn't?'  
他的话让我稍感安心，但那股隐隐的恐惧感依旧挥之不去。我强忍着不去问那些问题，比如，'如果它不呢？'

"So is there anything you do remember?"  
“那你记得些什么吗？”

"No... nothing." I tell him.  
“不……什么也不记得。”我告诉他。

"Well try to not worry about it!" He reassures me again, "Few days rest and everything will work out fine."  
“尽量别担心！”他又安慰我，“休息几天，一切都会好起来的。”

**UN Emergence Support Facility – Late Evening  
联合国紧急支援设施 – 深夜**

I look into the bathroom mirror and once again try to recall just who it is I am. I can feel the frustration beginning to set in for me. It's been this way for three quarters of an hour and I've come no closer to remembering who I am than I was this morning.  
我望向浴室镜子，再次试图回忆我是谁。我能感觉到挫败感开始涌上心头。这种情况已经持续了四十五分钟，而我对自己身份的记忆并不比今早更清晰。

I know that they said this would only be temporary but I want to know, I need to know. I don't want to just sit there and wait. I want to try and do everything I can to remember. I want to remember as soon as I can but as I look in this mirror all I see is the reflection of someone I don't know. I see eyes that I've never seen before, I see an expression I don't know and I'm scared. What if I can't remember?  
我知道他们说这只是暂时的，但我想要知道，我需要知道。我不想只是坐在那里等待。我想尽我所能去尝试回忆。我希望尽快记起来，但当我看着镜子时，我看到的却是一个我不认识的人。我看到了从未见过的眼睛，看到了一个我不熟悉的表情，我感到害怕。如果我无法记起来怎么办？

I had the chance to find out some things about what had happened. I found out that five years ago there was a cataclysmic event that threatened the world. It was an event known as the Third Impact, it had ultimately been stopped but a large number of people had vanished as a result of it. Many of those people had since returned, they had emerged from the very same body of water that I emerged from.  
我有机会了解了一些关于发生过的事情。我得知五年前发生了一场威胁世界的灾难性事件。那次事件被称为第三次冲击，最终被阻止了，但因此有大量的人消失了。许多人在那之后陆续返回，他们正是从我出现的那片水域中出现的。

They also explained the 'Emergence Sickness' phenomenon to me too. A number of returnees had suffered from a loss of memory similar to what I have done. All of these people would recover their members in time, some of them in a few hours and others would take a few days. They had no process for helping this happen, it was said that it would just happen in time.  
他们还向我解释了‘出现症候群’现象。许多返回者经历了与我类似的记忆丧失。这些人最终都会逐渐恢复记忆，有些人只需几小时，而有些人则需要几天。他们没有帮助这一过程的方法，据说记忆会在时间中自然恢复。

All I have to do is wait. All I have to do is wait and feel this frustration within me knowing I could do nothing about it. All I can do is wait and feel fear at the thought that I might be the first who doesn't recover my memory. What if I go the rest of my life not knowing who I truly am?  
我唯一能做的就是等待。我只能忍受内心的挫败感，明知无能为力。我只能等待，一想到可能成为第一个无法恢复记忆的人，恐惧便油然而生。如果我余生都无法知晓自己真正的身份，那该怎么办？

No! I will recover them, I can… I can feel them somewhere inside of me. I know they're there, as I listened to those people today I would hear certain words and phrases that would trigger certain feelings or emotions inside of me. I must be close to remembering but it is almost as if my memories are locked behind some giant door and I need to find the key.  
不！我会找回它们的，我能……我能感觉到它们在我内心某处。我知道它们就在那里，今天听那些人说话时，某些词句会触发我内心的某些感觉或情绪。我一定快要想起来了，但记忆仿佛被一扇巨大的门锁住，我需要找到那把钥匙。

I look once again at my own reflection and I observe just how peculiar I look compared to the others here. No one mentioned anything but upon seeing my own face for the first time I can see the striking differences between myself and them. It is like I am some sort of alien amongst them. I fix my gaze at the unknown face, stare deep into the red eyes, run my hand through my grey hair and observe my pale skin.  
我再次凝视自己的倒影，观察到自己与这里的人相比是多么奇特。虽然没人提起，但第一次看到自己的脸时，我就能明显看出与他们的差异。我仿佛是他们中的异类。我凝视着这张陌生的脸，深深地注视着那双红眼睛，抚摸着灰色的头发，观察着苍白的皮肤。

Perhaps… Perhaps it would be best if I took their advice and go to sleep. Maybe in the morning I will remember. I look towards the other room and I can feel tiredness throughout my body. I will sleep, tomorrow may bring the answers I seek.  
或许……或许听从他们的建议去睡觉是最好的选择。也许到了早晨我会记起来。我望向另一个房间，感到全身疲惫。我会睡去，明天或许会带来我寻求的答案。

**January 12****th** **- Early Morning**  
1 月 12 日 - 清晨

I remember! I remember! I remember!  
我想起来了！我想起来了！我想起来了！

I awake suddenly from my restless slumber, I can feel my heart pounding rapidly in my chest and I feel the sheets cling to my sweat covered body. Tears sting my eyes as I lay on my side with my eyes wide open staring at the wall.  
我从不安稳的睡眠中猛然惊醒，能感觉到心脏在胸腔内急速跳动，汗水浸湿的身体让床单紧贴。泪水刺痛了我的双眼，我侧躺着，眼睛睁得大大的，凝视着墙壁。

I know who I am! I know what I am and… I know that I should not… I should not be here.  
我知道我是谁！我知道我是什么，而且……我知道我不应该……我不应该在这里。

As I lay on my side not daring to move my nightmare replays itself in my head. I have never dreamed before. I was… I was incapable of such things, I thought I was incapable of such things and yet I have experienced that very such thing right now. The dream was of those final moments, my taking of Evangelion Unit 02, that long trip down to Central Dogma, my conversation with Shinji and my sacrifice.  
我侧躺着，不敢动弹，噩梦在脑海中重演。我从未做过梦。我……我以为自己无法做梦，然而此刻我却经历了那样的梦境。那梦是关于那些最后的时刻，我驾驶初号机，那漫长的旅程前往中央教条区，与真嗣的对话，以及我的牺牲。

I have very little time to dwell on this as I'm suddenly hit with another new and unpleasant sensation. A sharp pain is felt in my stomach and I feel an odd queasiness and dizziness in my head. I lie still for a moment hoping it will go away before the pain turns to a burning sensation. In that moment my instincts kick in and I leap out of the bed.  
我几乎没有时间深思这个问题，因为突然间我又被一种新的、令人不快的感觉击中。腹部传来一阵剧痛，头部感到一种奇怪的恶心和眩晕。我静静地躺了一会儿，希望这疼痛会消失，但随后疼痛转为灼热感。那一刻，我的本能驱使我跳下床。

I sprint into the bathroom just in time for the feeling to completely overwhelm me. I collapse to my knees both of them hitting the tiled floor roughly and painfully. I feel more pain throughout me as I retch and throw up violently into the toilet bowl.  
我冲进浴室，正好赶上这种感觉完全压倒我。我双膝跪地，重重地摔在瓷砖地板上，疼痛难忍。我全身感到更多的疼痛，剧烈地呕吐，将胃里的东西全部吐进了马桶。

With my stomach emptied I remain still for a moment and let out a soft whimper as more tears run down my cheek. My stomach and chest hurt so much, my knees hurt from collapsing onto them. I weakly reach for a piece of toilet tissue and wipe my mouth before flushing the contents of the toilet.  
胃里清空后，我静静地待了一会儿，轻声呜咽，泪水顺着脸颊流下。我的胃和胸部疼痛难忍，膝盖也因为跪倒而疼痛。我无力地伸手拿了一张卫生纸，擦了擦嘴，然后冲掉了马桶里的内容物。

I let out another soft whimper. I remember everything now. I remember it all so clearly. I daren't move from my position in the cold bathroom. Instead I bring my knees up to my naked chest and wrap my arms around them.  
我又发出一声轻轻的呜咽。现在我全记起来了。一切都那么清晰。我不敢从冰冷的浴室里挪动位置。相反，我将自己的膝盖抱到赤裸的胸前，双臂环绕着它们。

All of those memories were rushing through my head now. I can remember it all. I can remember NERV, SEELE, my own birth and the man who raised me. I can remember Shinji with his sweet smile and innocence. I can remember his eyes when I betrayed him. I can… remember it all now and contrary to my previous wishes I wish I could forget it again.  
所有这些记忆此刻正涌入我的脑海。我全都能记起来。我记得 NERV，SEELE，我自己的诞生和抚养我的人。我记得真嗣那甜美的微笑和纯真。我记得我背叛他时他的眼神。我……现在全都能记起来，与之前的愿望相反，我真希望自己能再次忘却这一切。

I am Kaworu Nagisa… I was the last Angel mankind had to face. I should not be alive. These thoughts continue to cycle through my mind as I hug my knees tightly and my soft whimpers turn to loud sobs. I fear sleep will not find me again tonight as I sit sobbing on the hard bathroom floor.  
我是渚薰……我是人类必须面对的最后一个使徒。我不应该活着。这些念头不断在我脑海中循环，我紧紧抱着膝盖，轻声的呜咽变成了大声的哭泣。我害怕今晚无法再次入睡，坐在坚硬的浴室地板上哭泣。

**January 19****th** **– Morning** 1 月 19 日 —— 清晨

One week has passed since I emerged from the sea of souls as I have come to understand it. One week since I was somehow given a second chance at life. One whole week of nights filled with nightmares and days filled with the fear of others. I've spent each day since I recalled who I was living in fear that I will be hurt. I've spent each night terrified of going to sleep knowing that only nightmares will await me.  
自从我理解了自己是如何从灵魂之海中浮现出来，已经过去了一周。自从我不知怎么地得到了第二次生命的机会，已经整整一周了。这一周里，夜晚充斥着噩梦，白天则充满了对他人的恐惧。自从我记起自己是谁以来，每一天我都在害怕会受到伤害。每一个夜晚，我都害怕入睡，因为我知道等待我的只有噩梦。

It is something of a cruel irony, in my past life I had always wondered what it must be like to dream. I was almost envious of those Lilim who did so. I always wondered what sort of dreams I would have and wished that I were able to. Now I just wish I could be like that again. The reality is far more terrifying than the fantasy.  
这是一种残酷的讽刺，在我过去的生活中，我总是想知道做梦是什么感觉。我几乎羡慕那些会做梦的莉莉姆。我总是想知道我会做什么样的梦，并希望自己也能做梦。现在，我只希望能回到那种状态。现实远比幻想更可怕。

Yet dreams were just one thing I have had to get used to over this past week. I have been examined by this facilities medical staff, spoken to the people who brought me in and it seems I am now completely human. I am no longer an Angel, I am one of them.  
然而，梦境只是过去这一周我不得不适应的众多事物之一。我接受了这里医疗人员的检查，与带我来此的人交谈，似乎我现在已经完全变成了人类。我不再是天使，而是他们中的一员。

It is a feeling that is both liberating to me and terrifying at the same time. I find myself no longer plagued by the crippling loneliness I used to feel in that form, I also find myself no longer plagued by the call of Adam or Lilith. I am no longer able to sense the A.T. Fields of every being around me but I am also no longer able to protect myself with my own A.T. Field should the need arise.  
这种感觉对我来说既是解放，又同时令人恐惧。我发现不再被那种形态下的极度孤独所困扰，也不再受到亚当或莉莉丝的召唤所困扰。我不再能感知周围每一个存在的 A.T.力场，但同样，如果需要，我也无法再用自己的 A.T.力场来保护自己。

I have found myself struggling with the array of emotions within me. When I was an Angel I felt emotions but they were always dulled by other parts that made up myself. I perhaps did not feel them nor could I express them quite as a human would. Yet now I am feeling these things, I am feeling fear and sadness properly for the first time, it is somewhat overwhelming to get used to.  
我发现自己在应对内心复杂的情感时感到挣扎。作为天使时，我也有情感，但它们总是被构成我自身的其他部分所淡化。我或许没有感受到它们，也无法像人类那样表达它们。但现在我感受到了这些情感，我第一次真正感受到了恐惧和悲伤，这有些让人难以适应。

Again I used to wonder what it'd be like to feel those unchained emotions. To be able to express myself properly and experience what humans feel. They were always fascinating beings to me, I was always told I was above them, better than them and yet in many ways I longed to be one of them. I wondered what made me above them, what made me better than them? I know the truth now, I was not above them or better than them, I was simply different but… I have realized this truth much too late.  
曾经，我常常好奇那种无拘无束的情感体验会是什么样子。能够自如地表达自己，感受人类所经历的一切。他们对我来说总是充满魅力，我常被告知自己凌驾于他们之上，比他们更优秀，然而在很多方面，我却渴望成为他们中的一员。我曾疑惑，是什么让我凌驾于他们之上，又是什么让我比他们更优秀？如今我明白了真相，我并非凌驾于他们之上，也并非比他们更优秀，我只是与众不同……但遗憾的是，我领悟这个真相太迟了。

In speaking to me I have been assured by the people who brought me in that I am safe. That they do know who I was and what I was and that no harm will come to me. That I am to be treated the same as anyone else who has been through this process has been. It is a small comfort to me, a person who was brought up being told constantly about the negative side of humanity.  
在与我交谈中，那些将我带来的人向我保证，我是安全的。他们知道我的过去和我的身份，不会让我受到伤害。我将被同等对待，就像经历过这个过程的其他人一样。对于一个从小被不断灌输人性负面的人来说，这算是一点小小的慰藉。

As I lie in my bed my thoughts turn once again to the person who I hurt all those years ago. I wonder if these feelings of fear I have now are what he used to feel. Did you feel fear like this Shinji? Did you feel it each time before you piloted the Eva? Did you feel it before you went to school? Was this fear inside me the same as the crippling fear inside of you?  
当我躺在床上，思绪再次飘向多年前我伤害的那个人。我在想，我现在感受到的恐惧是否就是他曾经感受到的。真嗣，你曾感到过这样的恐惧吗？每次驾驶 Eva 之前，你是否都感到过这种恐惧？上学前呢？我内心的这种恐惧，是否与你那令人瘫痪的恐惧相同？

I sit myself up and look around my quarters. They are somewhat barren but larger and more homely than what I was used to in the past. In one corner is a wardrobe with a chest of drawers next to it that I am used to store the clothing I've been given by the facility staff.  
我坐起身来，环顾我的房间。虽然有些空旷，但比过去习惯的环境要大得多，也温馨得多。在一个角落里，有一个衣柜，旁边是一个抽屉柜，我习惯将设施工作人员给我的衣服存放在那里。

In an opposite corner is a small kitchen where I am able to make myself small meals and tea. The centre of the room has a small sofa with a television set up in front of it. I grab the remote control and turn the television on. Immediately I'm greeted by two hosts on some morning talk show, they seem to be discussing a news report about a recent raid on what was suspected to be a SEELE facility.  
在对角是一个小厨房，我可以在那里为自己准备简单的饭菜和茶。房间中央有一张小沙发，前面摆放着一台电视机。我拿起遥控器，打开电视。立刻，我被某个早间谈话节目的两位主持人迎接，他们似乎正在讨论一则关于最近突袭疑似 SEELE 设施的新闻报道。

I quickly change the channel not wishing to hear anything related to that organization now or in the near future. Instead I settle on some kids cartoon and leave it on in the background as I start to get changed. I get halfway through putting my trousers on before I hear a faint knock at the door.  
我迅速换了个频道，不想听到任何与那个组织现在或近期有关的消息。转而选择了一部儿童卡通片，让它在背景中播放，我开始换衣服。裤子穿到一半时，我听到了一阵轻微的敲门声。

"Just a moment." I call out to whoever it is and finish putting on the rest of my clothes. I button up my shirt and wander over to the door. Opening it reveals Kodama Horaki, the woman who found me on the beach a week ago.  
“稍等一下。”我朝门外的人喊道，并迅速穿好剩下的衣服。扣好衬衫，我漫步到门口。打开门，眼前是 Kodama Horaki，一周前在海滩上发现我的那位女士。

"Mr Nagisa." She addresses me in a formal manner, one that makes me feel slightly uncomfortable. I've never really understood formal greetings as far as humans go but it is not my lack of understanding that provides discomfort. It is that it reminds me of my first meeting with Shinji Ikari.  
“Nagisa 先生。”她以一种正式的方式称呼我，这让我感到有些不自在。我从未真正理解过人类的正式问候，但让我不舒服的并非缺乏理解。而是这种称呼让我想起了与 Shinji Ikari 的初次见面。

I force a smile to my lips, "Please... As I have said before feel free to call me Kaworu."  
我强扯出一丝微笑，“请……如我之前所说，随意称呼我为渚薰。”

She nods at me, "Fine, Kaworu it is then! How are you feeling today?"  
她朝我点点头，“好吧，那就叫你渚薰！今天感觉如何？”

I step aside and let her into the room and close the door behind her. I look for a moment and the smile leaves my lips. I consider telling her I am fine but it would not help me to lie to her.  
我侧身让她进屋，随后关上门。我凝视片刻，嘴角的笑容消失了。我本想告诉她我很好，但对她撒谎对我并无益处。

"I am... feeling better. I am still struggling with the nightmares though."  
"我感觉...好些了。不过噩梦还是困扰着我。"

Her expression softened on hearing my words, "That's understandable, a lot of people when they emerge do experience these things for a short amount of time. If they are that bad then I might be able to speak to someone to give you something?"  
她听到我的话后，表情柔和了许多，""这是可以理解的，很多人刚醒来时都会短暂经历这些。如果它们真的很严重，我可以找人给你开点什么吗？""

I shake my head, "No, I would... as frightening as they are I should deal with them. I fear that they are not just a symptom of the emergence but something else. It is just... I am not used to the experience of dreaming either."  
我摇了摇头，""不，我宁愿...尽管它们很可怕，但我应该自己面对。我担心它们不仅仅是苏醒的症状，还有别的原因。只是...我也不习惯做梦这种体验。""

"You did not dream beforehand?" She asked me with some surprise in her voice.  
"你之前没有预知到这个梦吗？" 她带着些许惊讶的语气问我。

I shake my head once again, "No I didn't. I needed to rest and sleep in my previous body but dreams were not part of that process. I was told about dreams and what they were and I did wonder what it would be like to experience one. It is... ironic that in receiving my answer it only serves to terrify me."  
我再次摇了摇头，"没有，我之前需要休息和睡眠，但梦境并不属于那个过程。我被告知了梦是什么以及它们是什么样的，我也曾好奇体验梦会是什么感觉。这真是...讽刺，得到答案后反而让我更加恐惧。

"Like I said, if you need anything we can help you."  
"就像我说的，如果你需要什么，我们可以帮你。"

"I... Thank you, I will deal with it for the moment but remember your offer."  
"我...谢谢你，我会暂时处理这件事，但请记住你的提议。"

I look awkwardly around the room searching for some words to say. Before all of this, words would come to me so easily. Now I find myself struggling for things to say to people, I find myself silent a lot of the time.  
我尴尬地环顾房间，寻找着合适的言辞。在这之前，话语总是自然而然地涌出。如今，我发现自己与人交谈时常常词穷，很多时候都沉默不语。

I look towards Kodama again. She was not only the one who found me last week but she is also the one who has been helping me figure things out and guide me somewhat. When I remembered who I was she was the first one I told. She did not seem to be angry at me or upset with me despite knowing who and what I was. She is curious and something about her is familiar yet I do not know quite what it is.  
我又看向 Kodama。她不仅是在上周找到我的人，也是一直帮助我理清思绪、引导我的人。当我记起自己是谁时，她是第一个我告诉的人。尽管知道我的身份和来历，她似乎并不生气或失望。她充满好奇，有一种熟悉感萦绕在她身上，但我又说不出那是什么。

I think of something to say and strangely one question comes to mind, "Can I ask... what is going to happen to me?"  
我想找些话说，却奇怪地冒出一个问题，“我能问……我会怎么样吗？”

I pause for a moment, "It is my understanding that this facility was made for people to stay in on a temporary basis, am I right in assuming this is the case for me too?"  
我停顿了一下，“据我所知，这个设施是为人们暂时停留而建的，我这样理解对吗？”

Kodama let's out a sigh and shifts from one leg to the other, "Well actually that is why I'm here to talk to you. Your... situation is a unique one Kaworu. There is a lot of discussion going on above me that I'm not exactly privy too."  
Kodama 叹了口气，换了个站姿，“实际上，我正是为此来和你谈的。你的……情况很特殊，Kaworu。上面有很多讨论，我并不完全知情。”

"That is... understandable." I reply.  
“那是……可以理解的。”我回答道。

"Not just because of who you were but also because of who you are now, you see usually when people emerge and we know who they are we'll start a process of tracking down friends and family."  
“不仅仅是因为你过去的身份，还因为现在的你。你知道，通常当人们出现并且我们知道他们是谁时，我们会开始追踪他们的朋友和家人。”

It's hard for me to hide the sadness in my voice a I reply to her, "And I do not have either of those."  
我很难掩饰声音中的悲伤，回答她：“而我两者都没有。”

She steps forwards and places a warm comforting hand on my shoulder, "You don't have anything?"  
她向前一步，将一只温暖抚慰的手放在我的肩上，“你什么都没有吗？”

I shake my head, "Nothing, I was born into what the world knew as SEELE. My entire existence and upbringing were based around one thing and one thing alone. I... I was not supposed to live past that moment."  
我摇摇头，“什么都没有，我出生在世人所知的 SEELE。我的整个存在和成长都是围绕着一件事，而且只有这一件事。我……我本不该活过那一刻。”

"Kaworu..." She pulls me in closer, not quite hugging me completely but just enough to comfort me.  
“薰……”她将我拉得更近，虽然没有完全拥抱我，但足以给予我安慰。

"Friends and family were something I did not know, I am... alone in this world."  
朋友和家人是我未曾了解的概念，我...在这个世界上是孤独的。

There is a brief pause, she looks like she wants to say something but is hesitant. Finally, she does actually speak, "There is always Tokyo-2... We have rehomed most of the former NERV staff there and..."  
她顿了一下，看起来想说些什么却又犹豫不决。最终，她还是开口了，“还有东京-2...我们已将大部分前 NERV 员工安置在那里，而且...”

I take a step back and feel the fear rise up inside me as I shake my head, "N-No! I.. I do not think that after what I nearly did... I don't think It would be wise for me to be in such an environment."  
我后退一步，恐惧在心中升起，我摇着头说，“不！我...我不认为经历了那几乎发生的事...我觉得我再去那样的环境是不明智的。”

She steps puts her hand up to her chin and thinks about it for a moment, "I understand. Such things can... wait for the moment. As I mentioned the discussions are going on above me so I do not know the options available yet."  
她将手放在下巴上，沉思片刻，“我明白。这类事情可以……暂且等待时机。正如我所说，讨论正在我之上进行，所以我还不清楚有哪些选项可供选择。”

"I am... a unique and complex case." I say with some humour in my voice.  
“我……是一个独特且复杂的案例。”我带着几分幽默说道。

"Yeah... You certainly are." She smiles reassuringly at me, "It might take some time Kaworu but... whilst you're here I want to make sure you have everything you need to be happy. If you... If you need anything at all just reach out and ask me."  
“是啊……你确实如此。”她微笑着安慰我，“可能需要一些时间，卡沃鲁，但……在你在这里的这段时间，我想确保你拥有一切让你快乐的东西。如果你……如果你需要任何东西，尽管向我提出。”

It is quite an odd feeling to have someone ask me what it is I desire. It's a question I've never been asked before. Usually things were just given to me with an expectation that I would do what is required and no more or less. My upbringing was orchestrated by a committee and handled by many. It was broken down into stages and mapped out for me.  
有人问我想要什么，这种感觉颇为奇异。这个问题我从未被问及。通常情况下，事情会直接交到我手上，期待我按要求行事，不多也不少。我的成长由一个委员会精心策划，由许多人共同照料。它被分解成各个阶段，为我一一规划。

So now I have to think, is there anything that I... Kaworu Nagisa want? What do I desire? What are my likes and dislikes? Who... who exactly am I? I have shelter, I have access to food and I have some small comforts like a warm bed and a television. It's all provided to me and yet I am being offered more?  
所以现在我必须思考，我，碇真嗣，究竟想要什么？我渴望什么？我的喜好和厌恶是什么？我……我究竟是谁？我有住所，有食物可享，还有一些小小的舒适，比如温暖的床和电视机。这一切都已提供给我，然而现在却有人愿意给予更多？

Part of me would feel ungrateful and uncomfortable for asking for anything else. After all is this not enough? I have not exactly done anything to warrant anything else. Yet... there is something I do desire. Something that when I think back on did make me happy in the past and might help me now. I look at Kodama, "Actually... Is there a piano in this facility?"  
我的一部分会觉得要求更多显得不知感恩且不自在。毕竟，这难道还不够吗？我并未真正做过什么来换取更多。然而……我的确有所渴望。当我回想起过去，有些东西确实曾带给我快乐，现在或许也能助我一臂之力。我看向绫波，“实际上……这里有没有钢琴？”

"A piano?" She half smiles as she asks the question and I instantly feel uncomfortable asking for such a thing. Perhaps that was too much, too big of a thing to ask for.  
"一架钢琴？" 她半笑着问，我立刻感到不安，提出这样的要求或许太过分了。可能我要求得太多了，这事儿太大了。

I nod, "Yes... I... I used to enjoy playing the piano. I think... I think it might help if I could play again?"  
我点点头，"是的...我...我以前喜欢弹钢琴。我想...如果我能再弹的话，也许会有所帮助？"

Her smile widens, "I'm not sure but... I'll see what I can do."  
她的笑容更甚，"我不确定，但...我会尽力去办。"

**January 26****th** **- Afternoon** 1 月 26 日 - 下午

My fingers dance lightly across the piano as I feel myself completely lost in my own music. I pay no attention to the book in front of me instead I allow myself to play what it is I desire. I allow myself to play without any idea of what it is that'll come next. I skip from note to note, black key to white key, shifting scale and time signature exploring the full depth of what it is I can do.  
我的手指在钢琴上轻盈跳跃，完全沉浸在自己的音乐中。我不再关注面前的书本，而是任由自己弹奏心中所想。我让自己随心所欲地演奏，不去预想下一刻会是什么旋律。我跳跃在音符之间，黑键与白键交替，变换着音阶和节拍，探索着自己所能达到的深度。

Joy lights up my heart as I play, I feel free, a sensation unlike any I have felt before. I wonder if this is is how all those great musicians felt when they composed. Lost in their music and the worlds they created with their symphonies.  
随着演奏，喜悦点亮了我的心房，我感到自由，一种前所未有的感觉。我不禁思索，那些伟大的音乐家在创作时是否也感受到了这样的心境。迷失在他们的音乐中，以及他们用交响乐创造的世界里。

Kodama had, much to my great joy been able to find a piano. An older model that had been locked away in the facilities storage. It had been brought in when the centre had opened many years ago but put away again when the number of returnees had dropped off. I was of course the first person to emerge for quite some time, it was quite a shock to the people who worked here but they also seemed somewhat pleased to have me around.  
小灵非常高兴地找到了一架钢琴。这是一台较旧的型号，被锁在设施的储藏室里。许多年前，当中心刚开放时，它被搬了进来，但随着返回者人数的减少，它又被收了起来。当然，我是相当长一段时间内第一个出现的人，这对这里的工作人员来说相当震惊，但他们似乎也有些高兴有我在这里。

Since I have returned I have learned a few things from Kodama about this place. Before my return there had been talks of actually repurposing this facility for other usage. The area around Tokyo-3 had recently been discussed as a place of interest for certain groups. I do now know what for and I do not feel I need to know but as far as I have been told until they were certain no one would return this place would remain open.  
自从我回来后，我从小灵那里了解到了一些关于这个地方的事情。在我回来之前，曾有人讨论过将这个设施改作他用。东京-3 周边地区最近被某些团体讨论为感兴趣的地方。我现在不知道是为了什么，我也不觉得我需要知道，但据我所知，在他们确定没有人会回来之前，这个地方会一直开放。

I bring my improvisation to a halt and almost immediately I hear the sounds of polite applause from behind me. I feel myself blush immensely as I turn around and see Kodama beaming at me from across the room.  
我停止了即兴演奏，几乎立刻就听到了身后礼貌的掌声。我感到自己脸红得厉害，转过身去，看到小灵在房间的另一边对我微笑。

"That was amazing Kaworu! How long have you been playing for?"  
"那真是太棒了，薰！你弹琴多久了？"

I smile nervously, I am unused to praise for my abilities, in my past I was told what I did was adequate and no more.  
我紧张地笑了笑，我不习惯因我的能力而受到表扬，过去我被告知我所做的一切只是勉强合格，仅此而已。

"As long as I can remember." I say to her, "It was... one of the few forms of entertainment I was granted access to I suppose. My former handlers felt I should have some appreciation for human culture and so the piano was chosen for me along with the works of various classical composers."  
"从我有记忆开始。"" 我回答她，""我想，这是我被允许接触的少数娱乐方式之一。我的前任监护人认为我应该对人类文化有所欣赏，于是钢琴和各种古典作曲家的作品被选中给了我。"

"Was it one of their pieces you were playing just now?"  
"刚才你弹的是他们的作品之一吗？"

I allow myself a smile and shake my head, "It was not... I was... Improvising just now. I suppose you could call it my first act of rebellion against them."  
我微微一笑，摇了摇头，“不是的……我刚才……即兴演奏。我想你可以称之为我对他们的第一次反抗。”

"Rebellion?" She asks with some curiosity.  
"反抗？" 她带着几分好奇问道。

I smile sheepishly, "When I was with them I did enjoy what I was exposed to. I truly thought it was wondrous and the very height of human culture. How people could tell stories and convey emotion with notes on a page. Yet I was limited in what I could do, I was to play only works by the so-called greats. My days were filled with endless recitals of Back, Beethoven, Mozart and so on and so forth."  
我尴尬地笑了笑，“和他们在一起时，我确实享受了我所接触到的一切。我真心认为那是奇妙的，是人类文化的巅峰。人们如何用纸上的音符来讲述故事、传达情感。然而，我所能做的有限，我只能演奏那些所谓大师的作品。我的日子充满了无尽的巴赫、贝多芬、莫扎特等人的曲目。”

"And you didn't enjoy this?"  
“那你不喜欢这样吗？”

"At the time I didn't mind but... I no longer have a desire to go back to those. I wish to create my own path."  
“当时我并不介意，但……我不再有回到那里的欲望了。我希望开创自己的道路。”

Kodama sits herself down near to me, "Sounds like some really pushy parents. So... it was just the 'greats'? No modern stuff at all?"  
小球坐在我旁边，“听起来像是些非常强势的父母。那么...只有‘经典’作品吗？完全没有现代的东西？”

"I am afraid not." I reply, "The past one hundred and fifty years or so of human popular culture is little more than a blank to me. I know a few names here and there but I cannot say I have ever watched a television show properly, I have not seen a movie nor did I listen to anything modern. I was..."  
“恐怕是的。”我回答，“过去一百五十年左右的人类流行文化对我来说几乎是一片空白。我只知道一些零星的名字，但我从未完整地看过一部电视剧，没看过电影，也没听过任何现代音乐。我……”

I trailed off as I see her stand up and come over to me. She sits herself down next to me on the bench and puts an arm around me.  
我话音未落，只见她站起身朝我走来。她在我旁边的长椅上坐下，伸手搂住了我。

"I'm... so sorry you had to go through that Kaworu."  
"我...真的很抱歉，你经历了那些，渚。"

I shrug, "It is... something I have come to accept and I suppose I did not think about it at the time. My life was driven by one purpose, one goal and that was supposed to lead humanity onto its next stage... I..."  
我耸耸肩，“这是...我已经接受的事情，我想当时我并没有多想。我的人生被一个目的、一个目标所驱动，那本应引领人类进入下一个阶段...我...”

I trail off again and sniff as I feel the emotion well up inside of me. A tear trickles down my cheek as she hugs me closer to her.  
我又一次停了下来，吸了吸鼻子，因为情感在我内心涌动。当她更紧地拥抱我时，一滴泪水顺着我的脸颊滑落。

"I was not aware of how lonely my existence was."  
“我未曾意识到自己的存在有多么孤独。”

Her arm tightens, "You don't need to be alone anymore Kaworu. There is a huge world out there and plenty of time for you to explore all sorts of things.  
她的手臂收紧，“你不再需要独自一人了，卡沃鲁。外面有一个广阔的世界，你有足够的时间去探索各种各样的事物。”

I look at her and wipe the tears away, "I am... truly sorry for what I was Kodama..."  
我看着她，擦去泪水，“我……真的为曾经的自己感到抱歉，小玉……”

"you don't have to be." She replies sternly, "What happened... It wasn't your fault. We know what SEELE did to you and also to many others. We know how they hurt and manipulated people. The best thing you can do now is move forward Kaworu..."  
"你不必这样。" 她严肃地回答，"发生的事...不是你的错。我们知道 SEELE 对你和其他许多人做了什么。我们知道他们是如何伤害和操纵人们的。你现在能做的最好的事情就是向前看，Kaworu..."

"I... I guess." "我...我想是的。"

She looks at me, "Anyway I wasn't just hear to attend your little concert, it seems you have a visitor."  
她看着我，"无论如何，我来这里不仅仅是为了参加你的小音乐会，看来你有访客了。"

I look at her in confusion, "A visitor? For me? I do not understand, I don't know anyone here unless..."  
我困惑地看着她，“访客？找我？我不明白，我在这里不认识任何人，除非……”

I can feel my eyes widen as that now familiar feeling of fear rises up inside me again. There is no one in this world I have any attachment to but one but... he could not be the visitor, could he? If he is then... no... I can't face him. I can never face him.  
我能感觉到自己的眼睛因那熟悉的恐惧感再次在内心升起而睁大。在这个世界上，我没有任何牵挂的人，除了一个……但他不可能是那位访客，对吧？如果真的是他……不……我无法面对他。我永远无法面对他。

"Actually..." Kodama speaks up, "We were a little bit confused too, we didn't... think the two of you had any connection but he has insisted on seeing you. He says he wants to help put things right for you."  
“实际上……”Kodama 开口说道，“我们也有点困惑，没想到你们俩会有什么联系，但他坚持要见你。他说他想帮你把事情摆平。”

**Meeting Room 会议室**

I'm not quite sure what to expect as I follow Kodama silently through the corridors of the facility. I try to think about who this person might be, my mind running through a number of possibilities. I had not dared to ask Kodama who this person was fearing what the answer might actually be.  
我并不完全确定会遇到什么，只是默默地跟着 Kodama 穿过设施的走廊。我试图思考这个人可能是谁，脑海中闪过多种可能性。我甚至不敢问 Kodama 这个人是谁，害怕答案会让我难以接受。

My mind had of course wondered if it might be Shinji. When I think about what I know, or at least what I knew of Shinji it would be just like him to come to me wanting to make things right. It'd be just like him to blame himself for what had happened. Yet that was the Shinji of back then, a lot will likely have changed in the five years that have passed.  
当然，我心中也曾猜测过可能是 Shinji。想到我所了解的，或者说我所知道的 Shinji，他来找我想要弥补一切，把责任归咎于自己，这完全像是他会做的事。但那是过去的 Shinji，五年过去了，很多事情可能已经改变。

I of course do not know what I would do if it were Shinji, I sincerely hope it is not him. I am not in a position to face him nor do I think I will ever be. I hurt Shinji badly, I offered him friendship and love when he was at his lowest and I betrayed him. It matters not that my feelings for him were real, I cared for Shinji, I wanted to be friends with him and despite knowing him for a short time I dare say that I felt love for him.  
当然，我不知道如果是真嗣我会怎么做，我真诚地希望不是他。我没有面对他的立场，也不认为我会有那样的勇气。我深深伤害了真嗣，在他最低谷时我给予了他友谊和爱，却背叛了他。尽管我对他的感情是真挚的，我关心真嗣，想与他成为朋友，尽管与他相识时间短暂，我敢说我对他的爱是真切的。

Yet I could not do anything to fight against the cruel masters known as SEELE or the call that I felt within my heart. Yet these things matter not, it has all happened and I cannot go back. I cannot change what transpired. I can only go on knowing that my actions helped drive Shinji to his lowest point and hope that he has maybe found some peace.  
然而，我无法对抗那些被称为 SEELE 的残酷主宰或内心深处的呼唤。但这些都无关紧要，一切已经发生，我无法回到过去。我无法改变已经发生的事。我只能继续前行，知道我的行为将真嗣推向了最低谷，并希望他或许找到了一些安宁。

I try to think of other possibilities, perhaps I can eliminate Shinji as a possibility. Kodama said she didn't think me and this other person had any connection. There were others in NERV that had encountered me only a number of time. Yet I cannot think of anyone who would wish to make anything up to me.  
我试图考虑其他可能性，也许我可以排除真嗣的可能性。Kodama 说她不认为我和这个人有任何联系。在 NERV 中，还有其他人只与我有过几次接触。然而，我想不出有谁会对我编造任何事情。

There is another possibility, perhaps a fallen member of SEELE but then… which one would have had such a change of heart? They all treated me with such disdain, like the tool that I was. Those old men would never change, I am certain of that.  
还有一种可能性，或许是 SEELE 的某个堕落成员，但随后……会是哪一个突然改变了心意呢？他们所有人都对我如此鄙夷，就像对待我这个工具一样。那些老头子绝不会改变，我对此确信无疑。

As we move into another corridor I see Kodama stop and she turns to face me, "Are you nervous?"  
当我们走进另一条走廊时，我看到 Kodama 停下脚步，她转身面对我，“你紧张吗？”

I nod, "Somewhat, I cannot imagine who it is who would wish to meet with me nor can I think of anyone who would wish to put anything right with me. If anything it is I who has a lot to put right with others."  
我点头，“有点，我想不出谁会希望见我，也想不出有谁会希望与我修复关系。如果有的话，那也是我有许多需要与他人修复的关系。”

"You know… you yourself were not to blame for what happened Kaworu." Kodama looks at me sternly as she speaks, "In your situation I think… I think all of us would have acted in the same way. You were born into that organization, you were raised by them and conditioned by them. Yet when it came to it you did not destroy us, you tried… to give us some hope and allowed humanity to go forward."  
"你知道……你本人并没有因为发生的事情而受到责备，Kaworu。" Kodama 严肃地看着我说话，"在你的处境下，我想……我认为我们所有人都会做出同样的选择。你出生在那个组织，由他们抚养和训练。然而，当那一刻来临时，你没有摧毁我们，你试图……给我们一些希望，让人类继续前进。"

I look at her and shake my head, "I hurt someone who had placed all their trust in me in the process."  
我看着她，摇了摇头，"我在过程中伤害了一个完全信任我的人。"

"Perhaps you did but… the way I see it you didn't have a choice. You didn't know better." She replied, "Things ended up alright in the end and… well you have the opportunity to have a life now. Life in Tokyo-3… wasn't easy."  
"也许你确实伤害了，但……在我看来，你别无选择。你当时并不知道更好的方法。"她回答道，"最终事情还是解决了，而且……现在你有机会过上新的生活了。在东京-3 的生活……并不容易。"

I look up at her and find it hard to hide my surprise, "You were in Tokyo-3?"  
我抬头看她，难以掩饰我的惊讶，“你曾在东京-3？”

She shoots me a grin, "Yeah! Although we actually evacuated shortly before your arrival. If things had been different… well you probably would have been one of my sisters' classmates!"  
她冲我咧嘴一笑，“是啊！不过我们其实在你到来前不久就撤离了。如果情况不同的话……你可能就成了我妹妹的同学呢！”

"Y-Your sister?" “你-你的妹妹？”

Kodama nods, "Yup! Hikari, she was the class rep at that time!"  
木灵点头，“嗯！光，她当时是班代表！”

"Of course." I mutter, now I know where I have heard Kodama's name before. Hikari was one of the students that would have been in his class. He had been given a file about his fellow classmates before he was sent to Tokyo-3.  
“当然。”我喃喃自语，现在我知道在哪里听过木灵的名字了。光是他班上的学生之一。在他被派往东京-3 之前，他曾收到过一份关于同班同学的资料。

"I… I thought your name seemed familiar… I was… SEELE give me a list of people who would have been in my class."  
“我……我以为你的名字听起来很熟悉……我……SEELE 给了我一份可能在我班上的人的名单。”

She shakes her head, "You don't need to explain, anyway we shouldn't keep our guest waiting any longer."  
她摇了摇头，“你不必解释，反正我们也不该让客人久等了。”

Kodama opens the door for me and I look into the room and fix my gaze on the elderly man wearing a dark blue suit and tie. He has a folder tucked under one arm and I'm surprised to see a warm smile on his face. He looks towards myself and Kodama and with his gaze I feel myself rooted to the spot. Of all the possibilities I did not consider that my visitor would be the former NERV Sub Commander Kozo Fuyutsuki.  
Kodama 为我打开门，我望进房间，目光定格在一位身着深蓝色西装和领带的老人身上。他腋下夹着一个文件夹，我惊讶地看到他脸上挂着温暖的微笑。他转向我和 Kodama，他的目光让我感觉自己仿佛被钉在了原地。在所有可能性中，我从未料到我的访客会是前 NERV 副指挥官 Kozo Fuyutsuki。

He bows politely, "Ms Horaki, Mr Nagisa."  
他礼貌地鞠了一躬，“Horaki 小姐，Nagisa 先生。”

I bow my head politely, "H-Hello."  
我礼貌地低下头，“您好。”

Kodama also greets him politely, "Mr Fuyutsuki."  
Kodama 也礼貌地向他打招呼，“Fuyutsuki 先生。”

I avert my eyes for a moment and look around the meeting room. It was a fairly basic affair, they had set up a small coffee table along with a couch and some comfortable chairs. A few colourful plants and pictures had been placed around the edges for decoration. Guided by Kodama I make my way into the room and sit myself down on the couch next to her.  
我短暂地移开视线，环顾会议室。这里相当简朴，他们摆放了一张小咖啡桌，还有一张沙发和几把舒适的椅子。四周点缀着一些色彩鲜艳的植物和画作。在 Kodama 的引导下，我走进房间，在她旁边的沙发上坐下。

This was most certainly not what I was expecting. I admittedly know very little about Fuyutsuki. I know what he was Gendo Ikari's right hand man at NERV and had some history with both Gendo and Yui Ikari. Outside of that I know nothing else, he was a non-factor in my mission.  
这绝对不是我所预料的。坦白说，我对冬月了解甚少。我知道他是 NERV 中碇源堂的得力助手，与碇源堂和碇唯都有一段过往。除此之外，我一无所知，他在我的任务中无关紧要。

"Thank you for arranging this." He speaks to Kodama before turning to look at me, "How are you feeling Mr Nagisa?"  
“感谢你安排这次会面。”他对儿玉说道，然后转向我，“你感觉如何，碇先生？”

I nod, "I am… feeling okay."  
我点头，“我……感觉还好。”

"That is good to hear, I understand myself that emerging from the sea is not the most pleasant of feelings. I will not take up too much of your time."  
"听到这个消息真好，我自己也深知从海中出来并不是最愉快的感觉。我不会占用你太多时间。"

"I… do not mind." I say to him before continuing and expressing my confusion, "I must admit that I am somewhat confused by your being here. It was mentioned that… well you wanted to…"  
"我…并不介意。" 我对他继续说道，表达我的困惑，"我必须承认，我对您在这里感到有些困惑。之前提到过…嗯，您似乎想要…"

"Make things up to you?" Fuyutsuki finishes my sentence for me, "Yet you do not recall us meeting. This is true, we did not meet once during your brief moments in Tokyo-3."  
"弥补你？" 冬月替我把话说完，"但你却不记得我们见过面。确实如此，在你短暂停留在第三新东京市期间，我们未曾谋面。"

I nod, "Then… what do you have to make right with me?"  
我点头，“那么……你有什么要向我弥补的吗？”

He shakes his head and sighs, "Perhaps I used the wrong phrase. I suppose… well what I am doing is a little bit selfish on my part. An attempt to make myself feel better about what happened for aiding in ruining the lives of many. Since that Third Impact I have been… making an attempt to contribute and help those who need it."  
他摇摇头叹息道，“或许我用错了词。我想……好吧，我所做的是有点自私。试图让自己对参与毁掉许多人生活的事情感觉好一些。自从第三次冲击后，我一直在……努力贡献并帮助那些需要帮助的人。”

I look at Kodama in confusion and she starts to speak, "Fuyutsuki was actually one of the founding members of this facility. He left after the first year though to travel the world and provide medical aid to those who needed it in areas damaged by the two Impact incidents. Fuyutsuki was… also instrumental in making sure the survivors of Tokyo-3 were given appropriate support and compensation packages."  
我困惑地看着 Kodama，她开始解释，“Fuyutsuki 实际上是这个设施的创始成员之一。不过他在第一年后就离开了，去世界各地为那些在两次冲击事件中受灾的地区提供医疗援助。Fuyutsuki 还……在确保东京-3 的幸存者得到适当的支持和补偿方面发挥了重要作用。”

"I… I see…" I stutter out a response, "So… you wish to help me?"  
"我…我明白了…" 我结结巴巴地回应，"那么…你是想帮助我吗？"

He nods, "I do. I'm going to be travelling to Europe shortly and will be staying in Germany for quite some time. I'm in need of an assistant to help me in my work. It will not be difficult work, nothing you couldn't learn to do easily. You will of course be paid for your work and on top of that I will ensure you have a place to stay on top of the compensation package you'll receive as a former pilot."  
他点头道，"是的。我不久将前往欧洲，并在德国停留相当长的时间。我需要一位助手协助我的工作。这不会是困难的工作，你很容易就能学会。当然，你会得到报酬，除此之外，我还会确保你有一个住处，作为前飞行员，你还将获得额外的补偿。"

I look at him in confusion, "I don't understand, surely there are many others already more qualified to do this than I. After all you know the circumstances of what I was and who I am."  
我困惑地看着他，"我不明白，肯定有许多人比我更有资格做这份工作。毕竟，你知道我的过去和我的身份。"

He nods again, "Yes I do, I know who you are and what SEELE did for you. I know that you and the other pilots have all experienced something horrible in your lives and I also know that I am partly to blame for that."  
他再次点头，“是的，我知道你是谁，以及 SEELE 为你做了什么。我知道你和其他驾驶员都曾在生活中经历过可怕的事情，我也知道我对此负有部分责任。”

He pauses for a moment to sip from his coffee, "I know that if I were to live another hundred years I could not possibly erase all the damage I have done but I wish to do what I can whilst I can."  
他停顿了一下，啜饮了一口咖啡，“我知道即使我再活一百年，也无法弥补我所造成的所有伤害，但我希望在我还能做些什么的时候尽力而为。”

"So that includes helping me?"  
“所以这包括帮助我吗？”

"Yes. I… do not expect you to answer me right away and I will not mind if you choose to reject my offer. I understand if you want to leave this place and forge a new life away from me and all of this but I ask that you at least consider it."  
"是的。我……并不期望你立刻答复，如果你选择拒绝我的提议，我也不会介意。我理解你想要离开这个地方，开启远离我和这一切的新生活，但我恳请你至少考虑一下。"

"I-I see…" I nod again as he places a folder down on the table, "In which case I shall consider your offer."  
"我明白了……" 我再次点头，他放下一个文件夹在桌上，"那么，我会考虑你的提议。"

**February 9****th** **- Facility Entranceway**  
2 月 9 日 - 设施入口处

It has been two weeks now since Fuyutsuki come to me with his offer of aiding me in starting a new life and working for him. Since his visit I looked extensively over the information he provided trying to understand what it was I would be doing. It seems that I will be aiding Fuyutsuki mostly in an administrative capacity. It seems like fairly basic things, filling out reports and mailing them for him. Handling calls and arranging appointments. All things that I feel I'm capable of doing.  
自两周前冬月向我提出帮助我开启新生活并为他工作的提议以来，自他来访后，我仔细研究了他提供的信息，试图理解我将要做的事情。看来我将主要在行政方面协助冬月。似乎都是相当基础的事情，填写报告并为他寄出。处理电话和安排预约。这些都是我觉得自己能够胜任的工作。

For accepting this role I'll be paid a wage and given my own apartment in Berlin. This will be on top of a package I'll be receiving from the UN as part of my compensation. I still don't really understand why I'm owed anything for my role in NERV. If anything I nearly destroyed their world rather than saved it.  
接受这个职位，我将获得薪水，并在柏林拥有自己的公寓。这将在我作为补偿从联合国收到的包裹之外。我仍然不太明白为什么我因为参与 NERV 的角色而欠我什么。如果说有什么的话，我差点毁了他们的世界而不是拯救了它。

As I stand here I wonder if I am right in accepting Fuyutsuki's offer. I look at this as an opportunity to finally start to learn about the world and experience what life has to offer. As I stand her though all I feel is sadness and the familiar sense of fear once more.  
当我站在这里时，我怀疑接受冬月的提议是否正确。我将此视为一个机会，终于开始了解世界并体验生活所提供的一切。然而，当我站在这里时，我所感受到的只有悲伤和再次熟悉的恐惧感。

I look behind me at the entrance to the facility that I have called my home for the last month. This place has been a safe space for me that has helped shelter me from the pain that I know waits outside its walls. It is a place where all I had to fear were the thoughts inside my head, but out here I have so much more to be afraid of.  
我回头望向那座设施的入口，过去一个月里，我称之为家的地方。这个地方曾是我安全的避风港，让我免受墙外已知痛苦的侵扰。在这里，我所恐惧的不过是脑海中的思绪，但走出这里，我有着更多需要害怕的事物。

"Nervous?" I hear Kodama's voice from behind me.  
“紧张吗？”我听到 Kodama 从身后传来的声音。

I nod, "Before… Before I was sent to Tokyo-3… Keel and the others in SEELE would often tell me about this world. They would tell me how corrupt and unsafe it was, about how dangerous humanity was. They would inform me of news reports on terrorist attacks, wars, murder, sexual assault and more. They told me about the world dark history, its many genocides, slavery and violent conquests."  
我点点头，“在被送到第三新东京市之前……Keel 和 SEELE 的其他成员经常向我描述这个世界。他们告诉我这个世界多么腐败和危险，人类有多么可怕。他们向我通报有关恐怖袭击、战争、谋杀、性侵犯等新闻。他们还向我讲述了世界黑暗的历史，多次种族灭绝、奴隶制和暴力征服。”

"They really tried to get you to believe humanity was at a dead end didn't they?"  
"他们真的试图让你相信人类已经走到了绝路，不是吗？"

I nod again, "Yes… I think that even then I knew what they were doing. I knew they were hiding the positive and beauty of the world from me. After all how could a world so bad produce the beautiful music I heard and performed?"  
我再次点头，"是的……我想那时我就知道他们在做什么。我知道他们对我隐瞒了世界的积极与美好。毕竟，一个如此糟糕的世界怎能孕育出我所听到并演奏的美丽音乐呢？"

I shuffle my feet, "I know the beauty of this world but I know it is dangerous and I am afraid."  
我挪动着脚步，"我知道这个世界的美好，但我也知道它是危险的，我感到害怕。"

"I understand, it can be scary out there."  
"我明白，外面的世界可能很可怕。"

"Also…" I pause, "I will be returning to Germany… to Berlin the… place of my 'birth' as it were."  
"还有……" 我停顿了一下，"我将回到德国……回到柏林，那个可以说是'诞生'我的地方。"

"Do you remember anything of the city?"  
"你对这座城市还有记忆吗？"

I shake my head, "Nothing, only a few pictures. I was never allowed out into the city itself. I can only remember parts of the facility that I was raised in."  
我摇摇头，“没什么，只是几张照片。我从未被允许进入城市本身。我只记得我长大的那个设施的部分区域。”

"Well it's a beautiful city from what I hear. I'm sure you'll love it."  
“听说那是个美丽的城市。我相信你会喜欢它的。”

"I hope so." I smile and watch as a black car pulls up in front of us, "I suppose that this is goodbye."  
“希望如此。”我微笑着，看着一辆黑色汽车停在我们面前，“我想这就是告别了。”

She nods before grabbing and pulling me close to her and hugging me, "Good luck Kaworu, please promise you'll stay in touch. I want to know everything okay?"  
她点点头，随即抓住我，将我拉近并拥抱我，“祝你好运，卡沃鲁，请答应我会保持联系。我想知道一切，好吗？”

I nod, "I will. Thank you for everything Kodama."  
我点头，“我会的。谢谢你的一切，小玉。”

With those words she releases me from the hug. I pick up the small suitcase I have and walk towards the car. I'm greeted by a smiling man in a suit, he takes the case from me and places it in the boot of the car. I feel a cool breeze around me as I turn and give Kodama and the facility one last glance.  
说完这些话，她松开了拥抱。我提起小行李箱，走向汽车。一位西装革履的男子微笑着迎接我，他从我手中接过箱子，放入后备箱。我转身再次看向小玉和设施，感到一阵凉风拂过。

I get into the back of the car and moments later it slowly pulls away from the facility. I now take the opportunity to take the gift Kodama has given me from my pocket. A music player filled with music of influential musicians from the late 60s through to the present day. I hear the music fill my ears as I gaze out of the window.  
我钻进车后座，片刻后车子缓缓驶离了设施。现在我有机会从口袋里拿出小玉给我的礼物。一个装满了从 60 年代末到现代有影响力的音乐家作品的音乐播放器。我听着音乐充盈耳际，目光投向窗外。

I suppose this is onward towards my new future, a future that I did not expect I would ever have.  
我想这应该是朝着我的新未来前进，一个我未曾预料会拥有的未来。

### Chapter 2: Both Sides Of The Story  
第二章：故事的两面  

**August 15th 8 月 15 日**

**Cafe – Berlin – Early Morning  
咖啡馆 – 柏林 – 清晨**

As I step out of the hot morning sun that shines overhead in Berlin and into the cool air-conditioned space that the café offers I reach up and take off my sunglasses. I look around and see a few people are here already. University students mostly come to study or recover from a night out drinking. Finally, I spot my target, a small and empty seat by the window, a perfect spot for me. I walk over and set my laptop down on the table, plug it into the wall socket and prepare to start my work.  
当我走出柏林头顶炽热的晨光，步入咖啡馆提供的凉爽空调空间时，我伸手摘下了太阳镜。环顾四周，发现已经有几个人在这里了。大多是大学生，来这里学习或从一夜畅饮中恢复。最终，我找到了目标，一个靠窗的小空位，对我来说再合适不过了。我走过去，把笔记本电脑放在桌上，插上电源，准备开始工作。

I'm barely able to load up the document before I hear a loud voice from behind me call out my name, "Asuka! It's so nice to see you, your usual?"  
我还没来得及打开文档，就听到身后一个响亮的声音喊出了我的名字，“明日香！见到你真高兴，还是老样子吗？”

I turn to look and call back with a grin, "Of course!"  
我转过身，笑着回应道：“当然！”

I see the source of the voice get to work behind the counter. He's the owner of this café, a short, jolly rotund man with a bushy blonde moustache. I always thought he looked a bit out of place running a café like this. He looks more like he'd be at home as one of the Gauls from and Asterix and Obelix comic.  
我看到声音的主人在柜台后忙碌起来。他是这家咖啡馆的老板，一个矮小、圆润且总是笑呵呵的男人，留着浓密的金色八字胡。我一直觉得他经营这样一家咖啡馆有些格格不入。他看起来更像是从《阿斯泰利克斯历险记》里走出来的高卢人。

Yet here he is running a café like this, not only does he run it but he is very good at it. It's become quite a popular little place since it opened up about a year ago. I come here frequently to get on with my work.  
然而，他就在这里经营着这样一家咖啡馆，不仅经营得有声有色，而且非常擅长。自从大约一年前开业以来，这里已经变得相当受欢迎。我经常来这里工作。

In barely any time at all I find him stood behind me, setting my coffee down on the table.  
几乎没过多久，我就发现他站在我身后，将我的咖啡放在桌上。

I smile politely, "Thank you, is it only you wokring today?"  
我礼貌地微笑，“谢谢，今天只有你一个人上班吗？”

He shakes his head, "Sofia should be coming in shortly. So, what are you working on?"  
他摇摇头，“索菲亚应该很快就会来。那么，你在忙什么呢？”

I shrug, "Nothing overly important. I'm just trying to finish up a few edits for the book before I send it off to the publishers for review. It's still a bit of a rough draft but it seems they want to make the announcement early and get some previews made. They want to make sure they get the news out of the sequel whilst there is still some hype for the original."  
我耸耸肩，“没什么特别重要的。我只是想在把书稿发给出版社审阅之前，完成一些修改。虽然还是个粗糙的草稿，但他们似乎想提前宣布并制作一些预览。他们希望在原作还有些热度的时候，确保续集的消息能及时发布。”

"Oh! How exciting!" He booms, "Does that mean you'll be getting interviewed by the press?"  
"哦！多令人兴奋啊！" 他大声说道，"那是不是意味着你将要接受媒体的采访了？"

"No chance!" I exclaim and shake my head, "I'm not even bothered if the damn thing gets published. It was just because a friend opened their mouth to someone the first one got published, I just want to write them."  
"没门！" 我大声否认并摇摇头，"我根本不在乎那玩意儿会不会出版。只是因为一个朋友对某人说了什么，第一篇才得以发表，我只想写它们。"

"You don't fancy even a small bit of the publicity from it?"  
"你难道一点都不向往由此带来的那点儿名气吗？"

"Like I care about something like that!" I snort with laughter, "Why do you think I write under a pseudonym? I don't need to be noticed or popular, other people can do all that."  
“像我会在乎那种事似的！”我嗤之以鼻，笑了起来，“你以为我为什么要用笔名写作？我不需要被关注或受欢迎，其他人可以做这些。”

For a brief moment it seems as though his expression changes to one of disbelief or confusion but in a second he goes back to his smiling self. I suppose I can maybe forgive his confusion, after all it is perhaps strange that someone would go to the effort of working so hard on something like I did and when it's out there not wishing for any publicity but he doesn't know me. He doesn't know the real me anyway.  
有那么一瞬间，他似乎露出了难以置信或困惑的表情，但很快又恢复了笑容。我想我可以理解他的困惑，毕竟有人如此努力地创作，却不希望得到任何关注，这或许很奇怪。但他并不了解我，无论如何，他不知道真正的我。

Maybe once upon a time I'd have welcomed the publicity and opportunity to be noticed. I'd have demanded the publicity and been on hand to sign copies and have my name be known. I'm no longer that person though. Now I just want peace and quiet and for people to leave me alone. I'm not that bratty kid who demanded to be seen and be the centre of attention. I no longer desire for people to praise me constantly and worship the ground I walk on.  
也许曾经我会欢迎曝光和被关注的机会。我会要求曝光，亲自签名售书，让我的名字广为人知。但我已不再是那个人了。现在我只想要平静和安宁，希望人们不要打扰我。我不再是那个要求被看见、成为焦点的任性孩子。我不再渴望人们不断地赞美我，崇拜我走过的地面。

I am no longer Asuka Langley Soryu, the brash Evangelion pilot. I'm Asuka Langley Soryu, I live in Berlin and I write teen fiction as a hobby. Somehow, I managed to be quite good at it, a part of me isn't surprised though. It's not as if I don't normally become good at things I turn my hand to.  
我不再是那个鲁莽的 EVA 驾驶员——惣流·明日香·兰格雷。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，住在柏林，业余时间写写青少年小说。不知怎么的，我在这方面做得相当不错，虽然内心某处并不感到意外。毕竟，我通常一旦着手做什么事，总能做得很好。

Of course, to the owner of this café I'm just known as Asuka, a half Japanese, half German 19-year-old who has lived in the city all my life. He knows nothing of who I was, of who I used to be and nowadays no one knows that anymore. I made sure that no one would know where or who I was when I left Japan. I asked for all my records to be replaced with fresh ones, nothing would tie me to what had happened anymore. I asked for all contact to be cut off and to be left alone by the UN or whatever it was NERV would become.  
当然，在这家咖啡馆老板的眼中，我只是明日香，一个半日本半德国血统的 19 岁女孩，一生都生活在这个城市。他对我过去的身份一无所知，如今也没人再知晓了。离开日本时，我确保没有人会知道我的过去或我是谁。我要求用全新的记录替换掉所有旧档案，不再有任何东西能将我与那些往事联系起来。我请求切断所有联系，并希望联合国或无论 NERV 将变成什么组织，都不要来打扰我。

I'm not stupid though, I know that they're still out there watching me. I can sense their presence much in the same way that I could when I was younger. It's not Section 2 anymore but someone else but I know they're there. I was tempted at one point to contact them to tell them to stop and that they didn't need to watch over me but it'd just be more unnecessary hassle that I didn't need. Besides contacting them was a risk, if I contacted them the wrong person might say something and that would lead to people know where I was. So, I'll allow it for now, as long as they keep their distance and no promises get broken.  
我并不傻，我知道他们还在外面监视我。我能感觉到他们的存在，就像我年轻时那样。不再是第二区了，而是其他人，但我知道他们在那里。曾经有一刻我想联系他们，告诉他们停止监视，我不需要他们保护，但这只会带来不必要的麻烦。而且联系他们有风险，如果联系错了人，可能会泄露我的位置。所以，我现在允许他们这样做，只要他们保持距离，不违背承诺。

I'm about to go back to the document when I hear the owners voice again, "Will you be having lunch? Eggs are nice and fresh this morning."  
我正要回到文件前，又听到了主人的声音，“您要吃午饭吗？今天早上的鸡蛋很新鲜。”

My stomach rumbles at his offer, I skipped breakfast this mornign and it is coming up to lunch time. Maybe I should eat before I start work. I shoot him a smile, "Sound good, eggs it is then, scrambled and with bacon, sausage and toast I think."  
他的提议让我的肚子咕咕叫了起来，我今早没吃早餐，现在快到午饭时间了。也许我应该先吃点东西再开始工作。我对他笑了笑，“听起来不错，那就来份炒蛋，再加培根、香肠和吐司吧。”

**Tokyo 2 – Afternoon 东京 2 号——午后**

I'm sat nervously in the reception area of the building the UN has here in Tokyo-2. Laid carefully at my feet is my cello case and my eyes keep up a pattern of moving from the case to the clock on the wall and then at the receptionist as she does her work. It's been half an hour since I came in here and this pattern was started. All I want is for Misato to be finished with her meeting so that we can go home.  
我紧张地坐在联合国在东京 2 号设立的办公楼接待区。我的大提琴箱小心地放在脚边，我的目光不断在琴箱、墙上的时钟和正在工作的接待员之间来回移动。自从我半小时前进来这里，这种模式就开始了。我只希望美里能结束她的会议，这样我们就可以回家了。

I don't like being outside any longer than is necessary, if I can help It I barely go outside at all. I'm I'm told to then I will but most of the time I always have to be accompanied by someone. Being outside on my own terrifies me. I'm scared that someone might recognize me, know about me and what I've done.  
我不喜欢在外面待太久，如果可以的话，我几乎不外出。如果被要求外出，我会去，但大多数时候我总是需要有人陪同。独自在外面让我感到恐惧。我害怕有人可能会认出我，知道我的事情和我所做的一切。

There is a part of me that is trying hard to reject that. It's there using Misato's words, or the words of my friends to tell me that no one is going to recognize me and even if they did I haven't done anything wrong. They tell me that no one knows any of the pilot's identities and the pilots are the ones who saved the world, especially me.  
我内心有一部分正竭力抗拒这一点。它用美里的话，或是朋友们的言辞来告诉我，没有人会认出我，即便他们认出来了，我也没做错什么。他们告诉我，没有人知道任何驾驶员的身份，而这些驾驶员正是拯救了世界的人，尤其是我。

Yet those voices are so easily surprised by a louder one. It sounds like myself and it tells me that everyone I pass in the street secretly knows who I am and one day one of them is going to hurt me. It tells me that if they did hurt me that I deserve it. It tells me that when it does happen I'll have no one to blame but myself because I was really the one who nearly caused this world to end, I was the one responsible for the Third Impact and for ruining so many people's lives.  
然而，这些声音很容易被一个更响亮的声音所惊扰。那个声音听起来像是我自己，它告诉我，我在街上遇到的每个人其实都暗中知道我是谁，总有一天其中一个人会伤害我。它告诉我，如果他们真的伤害了我，那是我应得的。它告诉我，当这一切发生时，我只能怪自己，因为实际上是我差点导致了这个世界末日，我是引发第三次冲击和毁掉无数人生活的罪魁祸首。

I shake my head slightly, no. I mustn't think that. It wasn't like that, I wasn't to blame. I know it. I know I wasn't to blame.  
我轻轻摇头，不，我不能这么想。事实并非如此，我不是罪魁祸首。我知道的，我知道我不是罪魁祸首。

"Mr Ikari?" "碇先生？"

I nearly jump out of my seat at the sudden sound of the receptionist's voice. I look up to see her looking at me with an amused look on her face. I start to blush thinking about what an idiot I must have looked like.  
接待员突如其来的声音几乎让我从座位上跳起来。我抬头一看，只见她正带着一丝戏谑的表情看着我。想到自己刚才那副傻样，我不禁脸红起来。

"Can I get you something whilst you wait?"  
"您在等待的时候需要点什么吗？"

I shake my head, "N-No... No, thank you."  
我摇摇头，“不……不用了，谢谢。”

With those words the silence fills the room once more and I go back to my routine of looking from the clock to my cello case. I decide to leave the receptionist out of this now, still feeling like an idiot for jumping like that. In a way I'm thankful for that moment, it stopped the negative thoughts for a moment and now I can work on that.  
说完这些话，寂静再次填满了房间，我又回到了从时钟看到大提琴箱的日常。我决定现在不把接待员牵扯进来，仍然觉得自己刚才那样跳起来像个傻瓜。在某种程度上，我感谢那一刻，它让负面思绪暂时停止，现在我可以专注于处理这些了。

I need to remember what I've been told. Just slow my breathing and go through it all calmly. I knew something like this might happen today but I just need to remember what I tell myself when I go to school or out to get groceries. This is just slightly different to those times, I'm out longer and in a different part of the city.  
我需要记住别人告诉我的话。只需放慢呼吸，平静地应对一切。我知道今天可能会发生类似的事情，但我只需要记住自己去学校或外出购物时对自己说的话。这次只是稍微不同，我外出时间更长，身处城市的另一个区域。

I glance back down at my cello case as I keep making an effort to calm myself down. It's been a long time since I've played the thing. The last time was that night so many years ago, a night that is still fresh in my memory for all the wrong reasons. It feels like that night was the beginning or end of something, nothing that followed it was good and it was all my fault. If only I had acted differently then maybe... No... I can't... not again.  
我再次低头看向我的大提琴箱，努力让自己平静下来。已经很久没有碰过这把琴了。上次演奏还是在许多年前的那个夜晚，那个因种种错误原因而记忆犹新的夜晚。感觉那个夜晚是某种开始或结束，之后的一切都不好，而且都是我的错。如果当时我能有不同的举动，也许……不……我不能再这样了。

I feel my hands clench into a fist, my nails dig into the flesh in frustration as I once again try to get rid of those negative thoughts. It's just so difficult to do that today, I thought it would be but I just didn't know how hard. Why am I remembering that night, it happened years ago and I did nothing wrong. She did nothing wrong we were all... different then. You're not that Shinji anymore and Asuka... well she's gone now so that doesn't matter.  
我感到双手紧握成拳，指甲因沮丧而深深陷入肉中，我再次试图摆脱那些负面思绪。今天这样做太难了，我本以为会如此，只是没想到会这么难。我为什么要记起那个夜晚，那已经是多年前的事了，我并没有做错什么。她也没有做错，我们当时都……不一样。你不再是那个真嗣了，而明日香……她已经离开了，所以那已经不重要了。

I look up just in time to see the door under the clock open suddenly. I see two people enter the lobby in suits and for just a brief moment I see one of them look over at me with what seems to be a confused look on his face.  
我及时抬头，正好看到时钟下的门突然打开。我看到两个人穿着西装进入大厅，就在那一瞬间，我看到其中一人似乎带着困惑的表情朝我这边看了一眼。

He recognizes me, doesn't he? That's why he's looking at me like that! Any moment now he's going to come over here and I'll be...  
他认出我了，对吧？所以他才会那样看着我！随时他都可能走过来，而我将会……

My fingers dig more into my hands and the pain briefly snaps me out of it. Of course, he doesn't recognize me. He's probably confused as to what a 19-year-old kid is doing in a UN building with a cello at his feet.  
我的手指更加用力地掐进手掌，疼痛让我短暂地清醒过来。当然，他没有认出我。他大概只是困惑一个 19 岁的孩子怎么会在联合国大楼里，脚边还放着一把大提琴。

I know this, I know all of this. It makes sense and it's so logical but even with that I can't help but be terrified of them as they pass by me. I can't help but be sure I feel their eyes on me, piercing through me as if they know exactly who and what I am. I can feel time slow down as they go past me and I focus solely on the cello case. I feel sick and my leg starts to tremble slightly.  
我知道这些，我全都知道。这一切都合情合理，逻辑清晰，但即便如此，当他们从我身边经过时，我还是忍不住感到恐惧。我无法不确信我能感觉到他们的目光落在我身上，仿佛能穿透我，知道我究竟是谁，是什么。随着他们从我身边走过，我感到时间似乎变慢了，我全神贯注于大提琴箱上。我感到恶心，我的腿开始微微颤抖。

I hate this, I hate this so much. They're just ordinary people walking past. They aren't going to hurt me or recognize me. Yet it isn't until they finally pass through the entrance to the building and out onto the street that I can let go of the breath I've been holding, unclench my fist and start to try to calm down.  
我讨厌这样，我非常讨厌。他们只是普通的行人路过。他们不会伤害我，也不会认出我。然而，直到他们终于穿过建筑物的入口，走到街上，我才能松开一直屏住的呼吸，松开紧握的拳头，开始尝试平静下来。

This is too much, I should have just gone straight home rather than come here. I thought I was being brave but I'm just hurting myself by doing this. Thankfully I don't have to wait too much longer before the door opens and Misato walks through.  
这太过分了，我本应该直接回家，而不是来这里。我以为自己很勇敢，但这样做只是在伤害自己。幸运的是，我不用等太久，门就开了，Misato 走了进来。

"Shinji!" "真嗣！"

She doesn't hide her surprise at seeing me sat there waiting for her. I know she'd have expected me to go straight home after the lesson, she of all people knows how hard on me it is to be out like this. I half smile at her and nod, "H-Hey Misato."  
看到我坐在那里等她，她没有掩饰自己的惊讶。我知道她本以为我上完课后会直接回家，她最清楚我这样外出有多难。我朝她半笑了一下，点了点头，"嗨，Misato。"

She rushes over to me looking apologetic, "I'm so sorry I'm late! The meeting ran longer than I expected, have you been here long?"  
她急匆匆地朝我走来，面带歉意，“真对不起，我迟到了！会议比预期的要长，你等很久了吗？”

I stand up, "N-No... not too long anyway. Is everything alright?"  
我站起身，“不...不，也没等多久。一切都还好吗？”

She smiles at me and nods her head, "Everything is fine! I'll tell you about it in the car, I imagine you'll want to just get home now. We'll order food tonight, is that okay?"  
她对我微笑着点点头，“一切都好！我们上车再说吧，我想你现在可能只想回家。今晚我们点外卖，这样可以吗？”

I give her a nod and we make our way out of the building towards the car park. A few moments later I'm loading my cello into the boot of her car, a white Mazda Cosmo which she got shortly after we returned from the Third Impact. It was something she got to replace her Alpine and if I'm being honest I much prefer this car.  
我向她点头示意，我们便朝着停车场走去。片刻后，我将大提琴装进她的白色马自达 Cosmo 后备箱，这辆车是她从第三次冲击归来后不久买的，用以替代她的 Alpine。说实话，我更喜欢这辆车。

As I get into the front passenger seat and put my seatbelt on I already begin to feel a lot calmer. Even more so now that Misato is here.  
当我坐进副驾驶座并系好安全带时，已经感到平静了许多。尤其是现在美里在这里。

Misato gets into the driver's seat and gives me a sympathetic look. My nervous state clearly not going unnoticed by her, she places a calming hand on my leg and speaks, "I'm really proud of you Shinji, I know today won't have been easy for you."  
美里坐进驾驶座，给了我一个同情的眼神。她显然注意到了我的紧张状态，她轻轻地将安抚的手放在我的腿上，说道：“真嗣，我真的很为你骄傲，我知道今天对你来说并不容易。”

I hate it when Misato says she's proud of me. I always feel that little sting of tears behind my eyes when she does so. They're just words I was so unused to hearing and that I never thought I'd hear from anyone and I know she means it. I don't know if I can really express how much hearing that means to me from her, even if it is for something as simple as leaving our apartment.  
我讨厌 Misato 说她为我感到骄傲。每当她这么说时，我总感觉眼后隐隐有泪意。这些话我太不习惯了，也从没想过会有人对我说，我知道她是真心的。我不知道是否能真正表达出从她那里听到这些话对我意味着什么，哪怕只是因为我离开了我们的公寓。

"It... was really hard Misato." I admit to her with a weak smile, "I kept on thinking that at any one moment he was going to realize who I was. I... I don't know if I can do this."  
“这……真的很难，Misato。”我虚弱地笑着向她承认，“我一直想着他随时可能意识到我是谁。我……我不知道我是否能做到。”

The car starts to move onto the street, she keeps her eyes focused on the road as she talks to me, "Well you've done it once Shinji and that is something. It's really up to you whether or not you want to do it again."  
车子开始驶上街道，她目光始终盯着前方，边和我说话，“你已经成功过一次了，真嗣，这是件了不起的事。是否再做一次，真的取决于你自己。”

"Do you think I should?" I ask.  
"你觉得我应该吗？" 我问道。

"That's not my decision Shinji, that's yours to make. Do you want to continue?" Her tone shifts to sound a bit more serious, I already know what she is going to say next, "I don't want you to be doing this for me or for anyone else. I don't want you to do it because I said it might be good for you. You have to do this for yourself, you know I'll be proud of you no matter what, you're like a... no you are my son Shinji and I love you and want you to be happy."  
"这不是我的决定，真嗣，这是你自己的选择。你想继续吗？" 她的语气变得严肃了一些，我已经知道她接下来要说什么了，"我不想你为了我或任何人做这件事。我不想你因为我觉得这对你有好处才去做。你必须为自己做这件事，你知道无论怎样我都会为你骄傲，你就像……不，你就是我的儿子，真嗣，我爱你，希望你快乐。"

There is that phrase again and also the reminder that I am her son now. It's hard to blind away the emotion this time but I manage it. I take a moment to think about what she has said though. This is another thing I need to learn on top of not being afraid of everyone I encounter. I need to do things for myself.  
那句话再次出现，还有我现在是她儿子的提醒。这次很难忽视这种情感，但我还是做到了。我花了一点时间思考她的话。这是我需要学习的另一件事，除了不再害怕遇到的每个人之外。我需要为自己做事。

"I think I'll continue." I finally say after about a minute of thought, "I did... I really enjoyed the lesson despite being afraid."  
"我想我会继续下去。" 我终于在思考了一分钟后说道，"我确实……尽管害怕，但我真的很享受这堂课。"

"So, it went alright?" "那么，一切还顺利吗？"

I nod, "The teacher said I was a lot more advanced than he was expecting. He said that I didn't seem to have lost much of my ability over the years I haven't been playing. He could see where I was rusty and said it'll be a matter or practicing and going back over some of the things I've forgotten."  
我点头，"老师说我比他预期的要进步得多。他说我这些年没玩似乎并没有失去太多能力。他能看到我在哪些地方生疏了，并说这只是一个练习和复习一些遗忘内容的问题。"

I look around to see an eager look in Misato's eye, "Do you need anything? Books? New string? A new bow? Cleaning products? A stand?"  
我环顾四周，看到美里眼中热切的目光，“你需要什么吗？书？新弦？新弓？清洁用品？支架？”

I laugh at her enthusiasm, "No I don't need anything yet, I made sure it was all in good condition before I went to the lesson. My teacher let me know a website where I can buy sheet music too."  
我被她的热情逗笑了，“不，我现在什么都不需要，上课前我已经确保一切都处于良好状态。我的老师还告诉我一个可以购买乐谱的网站。”

"Well that's good then!" “那就好！”

"Yeah it is! I just…" I trail off as I remember what happened towards the end of the lesson.  
“是啊！我只是……” 我话说到一半，突然想起了课快结束时发生的事。

Misato of course notices what, "What?"  
美里当然注意到了，“什么？”

I try to shrug it off, "No… It's nothing…"  
我试图耸耸肩掩饰过去，“没什么……真的没什么……”

"Oh no you don't!" I cringe in my seat and look towards the window, "What is it Shinji?"  
“哦，不，你别想！”我缩在座位里，望向窗外，“怎么了，真嗣？”

I let out a sigh, "Well it's just… my teacher said that he would like to eventually get me on to playing with other people… Maybe even put on a performance one day."  
我叹了口气，“嗯，就是……我的老师说，他希望将来能让我和其他人一起演奏……也许有一天还能登台表演。”

I turn to see her nod, "I see… and what did you say to him?"  
我转头看她点头，“我明白了……那你跟他说了什么？”

"I kinda…" I shrink further down in my seat, "I said yes."  
"我有点…" 我更深地缩进座位里，"我答应了。"

"Even though you knew it might have been a problem for you?"  
"即使你知道这可能会给你带来问题？"

"I just…" I start but trail off and let out a sigh, "He seemed happy when he suggested it so I… I didn't mention it might have been a problem for me."  
"我只是…" 我开口却没说完，叹了口气，"他提出时看起来很高兴，所以我就… 我没提这可能会给我带来问题。"

I shake my head as I return to looking out of the window. I know what she is thinking and it's the same thing I'm thinking. For all the progress I might have made over the years I'm still that same old Shinji. I'm still just saying and going along with things just because it'll make others happy with me.  
我摇了摇头，重新望向窗外。我知道她在想什么，那也正是我在想的。尽管这些年我可能有所进步，但我依然是那个老样子，依旧是那个真嗣。我仍然只是随声附和，顺从行事，只因为这样会让别人对我感到满意。

"Is that something you would like to do?"  
“那是你想做的事吗？”

I hear her ask but I continue looking out of the window pretending I didn't hear her. For doing that she prods me in the leg and asks again, "Shinji! Is that something you would like to do?"  
我听到她问，但我继续假装没听见，望着窗外。为此，她戳了戳我的腿，再次问道：“真嗣！那是你想做的事吗？”

All I can do this time is muster up a simple shrug, "I don't know… I mean I do like playing and I want to continue but the idea of playing with others I just… I don't think I'm ready for it yet. I don't know… If I'll ever be ready but I also… I don't want him to be mad with me or disappointed."  
这次我能做的只有简单地耸耸肩，“我不知道……我的意思是，我喜欢演奏，也希望能继续下去，但和其他人一起演奏的想法，我只是……我觉得自己还没准备好。我不知道……我是否会有准备好的一天，但我也不想……让他对我生气或失望。”

"Well you have to explain that to him Shinji. I'm sure he isn't going to be mad or disappointed. I'm sure he'll understand, it's not an easy thing for anyone to do." She replied, "I'm sure he's just enthusiastic about his new student. Just… do what is right for you Shinji."  
“嗯，你得向他解释清楚，真嗣。我相信他不会生气或失望的。我确信他会理解的，这对任何人来说都不是件容易的事。”她回答道，“我敢肯定他对新学生充满热情。只是……做对你自己正确的事，真嗣。”

I nod and look back out of the window, "I… I'll try."  
我点点头，再次望向窗外，“我……我会试试。”

**Berlin – Early afternoon 柏林 —— 午后时分**

I set my coffee down on the table and give my recent edits another quick glance. I'm still not completely satisfied with what I have there but it'll have to do for now, it's something I can send to my publisher at the very least. I swap to my e-mail client and begin to write the e-mail.  
我将咖啡放在桌上，再次快速浏览了一遍最近的修改。我对现有的成果仍不完全满意，但眼下只能如此，至少这是可以发给出版商的内容。我切换到电子邮件客户端，开始撰写邮件。

Before I click on the send button I take a moment to prepare myself for what will come next. I ask myself if I really want to do this, if I really want to go through that again. The first time was just an accident, it was never supposed to happen. It shouldn't have happened but she… she persuaded me. Appealed to that stupid pride that lingers inside of me.  
在点击发送按钮之前，我稍作停顿，为即将到来的事情做好心理准备。我问自己是否真的想这么做，是否真的想再次经历这一切。第一次只是个意外，本不该发生的。它不应该发生，但她……她利用了我那愚蠢的骄傲，说服了我。

So I'll send this off and then they'd release the press release. I'd see it in the media with my pseudonym on it. After that I'll start getting the stupid requests to talk to the press, they'll tell me how good of an opportunity it'll be and how it'd be cool for people to meet the person behind the book. Just as with the first book I'll decline it all and stay anonymous. The publisher can handle all of that.  
所以我会把这稿子发出去，然后他们就会发布新闻稿。我会在媒体上看到我的笔名。之后，我就会开始收到那些愚蠢的请求，让我接受媒体采访，他们会告诉我这是个多好的机会，让人们认识书背后的作者有多酷。就像第一本书时一样，我会拒绝所有这些请求，保持匿名。出版社可以处理所有这些事。

It wouldn't be cool for any of them to meet the person behind the book because of who the person behind the book really is. I don't want to be known, I don't deserve to be known not after… not after everything I used to be. I'm trying to get away from all that and somehow I've ended up with this situation. A part of me wishes I had never been persuaded to take the first book to a publisher. Not people are going to expect things and… I know I'll eventually let them down. Just like I did before.  
他们中没有人会因为书背后的真实身份而觉得认识作者很酷。我不想被人知道，我不配被人知道，尤其是在……在经历了我曾经的一切之后。我试图远离那些过去，不知怎么的，我却陷入了这种境地。我的一部分希望自己从未被说服将第一本书交给出版社。现在人们会期待一些事情，而我……我知道我最终会让他们失望。就像我以前那样。

I sigh and look at the screen trying to force those thoughts out of my mind but I know now will come the other feelings. Those fears that I sometimes get when I look around in crowded spaces and I see other people looking at me. Of course they're not looking at me really but I can't help but think that. Third Impact had that effect on me, for a brief moment I was… we were all linked as one being. Of course I can't remember any of it and I know no one else can. Most of them don't even know it happened but I do and it's enough for me to worry.  
我叹了口气，盯着屏幕，试图将这些念头赶出脑海，但我知道接下来会有其他感觉涌上心头。那些我在拥挤的空间里环顾四周时偶尔会产生的恐惧，看到其他人似乎在盯着我。当然，他们并不是真的在看我，但我忍不住这么想。第三次冲击对我产生了那种影响，有那么一瞬间，我……我们所有人都被连接成一个存在。当然，我记不清任何细节，也知道其他人同样无法回忆。他们中的大多数甚至不知道这件事发生过，但我记得，这足以让我担忧。

What if one of them recognizes me? What if they figure out I was the one who nearly caused the Third Impact? I was the spiteful, hateful person that nearly pushed Shinji towards it. I was the abusive one who failed everyone and took it out on whoever was nearby. I was…  
如果他们中的某个人认出了我怎么办？如果他们发现我就是那个差点引发第三次冲击的人怎么办？我就是那个充满怨恨、几乎将真嗣推向深渊的人。我就是那个对所有人施暴、失败后迁怒于身边人的家伙。我就是……

I clench my hand into a fist and bring it down on my knee carefully enough that no one will see it but just enough for me to feel it. The short burst of pain brings me out of this spiral. I look back at the screen, I have an e-mail to send.  
我紧握拳头，小心翼翼地捶打在膝盖上，确保没人看到，但足以让我感受到。这短暂的疼痛让我从这种螺旋中抽离出来。我再次看向屏幕，有一封电子邮件要发送。

I'm about to hit the send button when my phone starts to vibrate on the table top. I contemplate ignoring it but a quick look at the caller ID and I grab it and answer immediately, "Hello!"  
我正要按下发送键，手机却在桌面上震动起来。我本想无视它，但瞥了一眼来电显示后，我立刻抓起手机接听，“喂！”

A few moments later a very soft and familiar voice is heard through the other end, _"Hello Asuka! I was just calling to see how you were?"_  
片刻后，电话那头传来一个柔和而熟悉的声音，“你好，明日香！我只是打电话来看看你怎么样了？”

I lean back in my seat and smile, "I'm doing fine! I'm actually just about to send out a sample of the next book to the publisher!"  
我靠在椅背上，微笑着说，“我很好！实际上，我正准备把下一本书的样稿发给出版社呢！”

_"Oh good!"_ She replies, _"So is it nearly finished?"_  
"哦太好了！" 她回答，"那是不是快完成了？"

"Mostly, I still need to work on some details for the ending and I'm not overly happy with a few of the scenes but it's good enough for them to look at. How come you're calling me now anyway? I thought you said you'd be in America around now?"  
"基本上，结尾的一些细节还需要打磨，有几个场景我也不太满意，但给他们看看足够了。话说回来，你现在怎么打电话给我？我记得你说过这时候会在美国的？"

There is another pause before she replies, _"I was but I'm actually at the airport about to board a plane for Germany. Would you like to meet up?"_  
她停顿了一下才回答，"我原本是的，但现在我在机场，正准备登机去德国。你想见个面吗？"

I feel myself frown at hearing her say that, my heart rate picks up just a little bit and I grip my laptops mouse a bit tighter in my hand, "Is there anyone with you?"  
听到她这么说，我不禁皱起了眉头，心跳微微加速，手中紧握着笔记本电脑的鼠标，问道：“你身边有人吗？”

_"No one, I am alone."  
“没有，我一个人。”_

"Will anyone know about it? Will you… will you be telling them where you are?"  
“会有人知道这件事吗？你会……你会告诉他们你在哪里吗？”

There is another pause and her voice comes back, it's easy to hear the disappointment, _"If you do not wish me to come then I will not. I will not inform them though and they still do not know I am in contact with you."_  
又是一阵沉默，她的声音再次传来，失望之情清晰可闻，“如果你不希望我来，那我就不来。但我不会告诉他们，他们仍然不知道我和你有联系。”

My frown deepens at hearing her disappointment, "No it's… I want to I just… you know the situations. I-I'm sorry I make you do that but you understand why don't you?"  
听到她的失望，我的眉头皱得更深了，“不，不是……我想要你来，只是……你知道情况的。我——我很抱歉让你这么做，但你明白为什么，对吧？”

_"I am your friend Asuka and I do understand. It will just be me and I promise they will not get to know unless it is something you want."  
“我是你的朋友，明日香，我理解。只有我会来，我保证他们不会知道，除非这是你想要的。”_

"Okay then! We'll meet up. When will you be here?"  
“好的！我们会面吧。你什么时候到？”

_"My flight will arrive late tonight in Germany, so tomorrow morning. Do you still live in the same place?"  
“我今晚的航班会晚点到德国，所以是明天早上。你还住在老地方吗？”_

I nod, "Yeah I do… I'll be in all day so just… let me know when you're on your way."  
我点头，“是的，我还住那儿……我整天都在，所以……你出发时告诉我一声。”

_"I will… Thank you Asuka, I look forward to seeing you."  
"我会……谢谢你，明日香，期待与你相见。"_

"I'll see you tomorrow, goodbye Rei."  
"明天见，再见，绫波。"

As I set my phone down my hands are trembling and I take a few moments to calm myself down from talking to Rei. I take a quick drink of my coffee and look back at the e-mail, I quickly finish it off and hit send my thoughts now turning towards seeing Rei tomorrow.  
当我放下手机时，双手颤抖着，我花了几分钟时间从与绫波的对话中平静下来。我迅速喝了一口咖啡，再次看向电子邮件，我迅速完成它并点击发送，现在我的思绪转向了明天与绫波的见面。

Rei is not one of, if not the only friend I actually have. Of all the people from my past life she is the only one I actually have any contact with. A rather bizarre turnaround for anyone who might have known me back then. I can just imagine what that younger Asuka would say to think that she was friends with that same girl she considered a rival that girl that she swore she hated.  
丽就算不是我唯一的，也是我真正拥有的朋友。在我前世的所有熟人中，她是唯一一个我还保持联系的。对于任何可能认识我过去的人来说，这真是一个相当奇怪的转变。我几乎可以想象，那个年轻的明日香会怎么想，她居然和那个她视为对手、发誓讨厌的女孩成了朋友。

Of course I didn't really hate Rei back then. I hated myself but I just took that out on everyone else. It didn't matter who it was be it Shinji, Misato, Rei or even Hikari. I just ended up hurting others because I couldn't deal with who I was. That's why I'm alone now, that's why I want to stay alone and not have anyone around me because I know if I even dare to let someone in I'll hurt them and maybe just maybe in the off chance I don't… they'll find out who I was and leave me.  
当然，那时候我并没有真正讨厌丽。我讨厌的是自己，只是把这种情绪发泄到了其他人身上。无论是真嗣、美里、丽还是甚至光，我都不在乎。我最终伤害了别人，只是因为我无法接受自己。这就是为什么我现在孤身一人，这就是为什么我想保持孤独，不想让任何人靠近我，因为我知道，如果我敢让某人进入我的生活，我会伤害他们，也许有那么一丝可能我不会伤害他们……但他们会发现我过去的真面目，然后离开我。

I know I'm being stupid. Rei has told me as much when I apologized to her the last time, I think that was apology one hundred and fifty two or something. Yet it doesn't stop me from remembering and thinking all of that and I know that tomorrow I'll apologize to her again.  
我知道我这样做很愚蠢。上次我向丽道歉时，她就这么告诉过我，我想那大概是第一百五十二次道歉了吧。然而，这并不能阻止我回忆和思考这一切，我知道明天我还会再次向她道歉。

I look back at the document, I know I'll do no more work today. My thoughts are all jumbled up, I need a distraction. I'll go browse that music shop I like and maybe go and look for a new game. Something to get away from my thoughts.  
我回头看了一眼文件，知道今天不会再工作了。思绪乱成一团，我需要分散注意力。去逛逛我喜欢的音乐店，或许再找款新游戏。总得摆脱这些念头。

**Tokyo-2 – Evening 东京-2 – 傍晚**

I enter the apartment and go straight into my room to put away my cello and get changed. As I do so Misato's words continue to ring in my ears and I start to wonder what I should do next. I try to separate what it is I think other people want from me and just what it is I want to do.  
我走进公寓，径直回到房间放下大提琴，换下衣服。过程中，美里的话依旧在耳边回响，我开始思考下一步该做什么。试图区分别人对我的期望和我真正想做的事。

It's a question I ask myself quite often, it's not as if I want to be like this. I don't want to be afraid of people but I am. I don't want to just go along with others to make them happy but I do. I won't want to be in the habit of putting my own happiness to the side so that I can hear some praise from others but I can't break that habit.  
这个问题我时常自问，并非我愿意如此。我不想害怕人群，但我确实害怕。我不想仅仅为了取悦他人而随波逐流，但我却这样做了。我不想养成牺牲自己的快乐以换取他人赞扬的习惯，但我无法打破这个习惯。

The problem is even if I do try to do something for myself I start to question it. When it comes to taking lessons on the cello I wonder who am I really doing this for? Is it just something to make Misato happy, so that she can see me being out and about and doing something? Is it so that she'll say she is proud of me?  
问题是，即使我尝试为自己做些什么，我也会开始质疑。当涉及到学习大提琴的课程时，我会想，我究竟是为了谁在做这件事？是为了让美里高兴，让她看到我外出并做些什么吗？是为了让她说她为我感到骄傲吗？

I let out a sigh of frustration with myself. I know Misato would be proud of me no matter what I chose. I'm like her... well I am her son now I guess. Shortly after Third Impact she made it official, she adopted me and become my mother. I just... the way her face lit up when she suggested it... how could I have said no?  
我无奈地叹了口气。我知道无论我选择什么，美里都会为我感到骄傲。我像她一样...好吧，现在我是她的儿子了。在第三次冲击后不久，她正式收养了我，成为了我的母亲。我只是...当她提出这个建议时，她脸上的光彩...我怎么能拒绝呢？

Even the story of why I play the cello is frustrating. I only started playing it because of my teacher and guardian at the time suggesting it to me. He thought it'd be good for me to learn to play an instrument, said it'd help me develop some confidence and told me an appreciation for music is always a good thing.  
就连我为何拉大提琴的故事也令人沮丧。我之所以开始拉大提琴，只是因为当时我的老师兼监护人向我推荐了它。他认为学习乐器对我有好处，能帮助我建立自信，并告诉我欣赏音乐总是件好事。

Strangely enough when I think about it, it was actually me who picked out the cello. I can remember it quite clearly, we were in the music shop and looking at the variety of instruments. Drums, guitars, piano, violins and so much more. Something about the cello appealed to me though. The shopkeeper gave us a demonstration and I just... I become attached to it. I took lessons and it did make my teacher happy that I was doing something.  
奇怪的是，当我回想起来，实际上是我自己选择了大提琴。我记得很清楚，当时我们在乐器店里，看着各种各样的乐器。鼓、吉他、钢琴、小提琴等等。但不知为何，大提琴吸引了我。店主为我们演示了一番，我...我就对它产生了依恋。我上了课，这让我的老师很高兴，因为我有所行动。

I did enjoying playing it though. I know deep down I wasn't just doing it for him but because I wanted to. I liked it and yes, I did want him to be proud of me and say that but I liked playing. I liked the way I could lose myself in what I was playing. I liked exploring the range of music composed for it and even trying to compose my own.  
不过，我的确喜欢拉大提琴。我知道我内心深处不仅仅是为了他，而是因为我自己想拉。我喜欢它，是的，我希望他能为我感到骄傲，说出来，但我喜欢拉琴本身。我喜欢沉浸在自己演奏的音乐中。我喜欢探索为大提琴创作的音乐范围，甚至尝试自己作曲。

I let out another sigh as I sit on the edge of my bed. I look down at the cello and go back to thinking about the lesson. My instructor had been a nice man. He was a lot younger than I expected. He did actually tell me that he also worked with a number of students and that I would fit right in. I couldn't help myself but say yes as soon as he asked if I'd be interested.  
我坐在床边，又叹了口气。低头看着大提琴，思绪又回到了那堂课上。我的老师是个好人，比我想象中年轻许多。他确实告诉我，他带过不少学生，我加入正合适。他一问我对这事儿感不感兴趣，我就忍不住答应了。

I couldn't help myself but he seemed so happy and enthusiastic about it and he offered praise. I'm like some dumb moth crashing into a lightbulb. I know I'm not ready for that sort of thing yet, I'm too scared to meet other people but I can't really explain that to him. How can I explain that I'm part of the reason Third Impact happened and that now everyone terrifies me?  
我情不自禁，他看起来那么开心和热情，还给予了我赞扬。我就像只愚蠢的飞蛾，一头撞向灯泡。我知道自己还没准备好面对这些，我害怕见其他人，但又无法向他解释。我怎么能告诉他，我是第三次冲击发生的原因之一，现在每个人都让我感到恐惧呢？

The worst thing about it is that deep down if it wasn't the fear of it I do want to do that. I want to be part of that group and I want to play cello with them. I want to be part of productions with audiences coming to see us play and I want to write and compose but I'm too damn messed up to admit or do anything about it.  
最糟糕的是，内心深处，如果不是因为恐惧，我确实想这么做。我想成为那个团队的一员，想和他们一起拉大提琴。我想参与有观众来观看的演出，想创作和作曲，但我太混乱了，无法承认或采取任何行动。

I just wish I could move forward! Every day since Third Impact has been some stupid struggle and I'm sick of it. I'm fed up of being afraid of people. I'm fed up of knowing I have no reason to be. I'm sick of having those old feelings of uselessness or feeling that people are going to abandon me. It isn't fair, none of it is fair! I just... I just want to be happy, don't I deserve that?  
我真希望能向前迈进！自从第三次冲击以来，每一天都是些愚蠢的挣扎，我受够了。我厌倦了对人们感到恐惧。我厌倦了明知自己没有理由这样。我厌倦了那些无用感或觉得人们会抛弃我的旧情绪。这不公平，这一切都不公平！我只是……我只是想快乐，难道我不配吗？

I can't help but shake my head sympathetically as I watch Shinji slip into his room and close the door behind him. I take this chance to go into my own room so that I can get changed into something more comfortable.  
我不禁同情地摇了摇头，看着真嗣溜进自己的房间并关上门。我趁机回到自己的房间，以便换上更舒适的衣服。

These past few years have been tough for those of us who were at the center of what happened. I know it's been especially tough on Shinji though. I can't even begin to imagine just what it is he is going through. He literally had the fate of the world in his hands at one point and for a brief few seconds it almost went. God only knows what it must feel like to be him.  
过去几年对我们这些身处事件中心的人来说很艰难。我知道这对真嗣尤其艰难。我甚至无法想象他正在经历什么。他曾一度掌握着世界的命运，有那么几秒钟几乎要失败了。只有上帝知道他是什么感觉。

Shinji has made some progress over the years though. We suffered a slight setback when Asuka left. He was heartbroken to see her go but it wasn't entirely unexpected. Yet it was a shame, I had hoped that maybe they would realize their feelings for each other and something would happen. Still maybe it was for the best, maybe the chance for them to be apart and find themselves will help them more. I just wish she hadn't cut off contact completely from us all. I'm sure she is alright but I don't know where she is now or anything.  
这些年，真嗣确实有了些进步。但当明日香离开时，我们遭遇了小小的挫折。看到她离去，他心碎了，虽然这并非完全出乎意料。可惜的是，我曾希望他们能意识到彼此的感情，或许会发生些什么。不过，也许这样最好，让他们分开并找到自我，可能会更有帮助。我只希望她没有完全切断与我们所有人的联系。我确信她没事，只是不知道她现在在哪里。

Shinji did seem to get over it eventually though. I don't know if he still thinks of her, I imagine he does. We talk about her from time to time, wonder what she is up to and if she is alright. I'm careful to not tease him about her. I enjoy a joke but I've come to realize that there are some jokes that shouldn't be made.  
不过，真嗣最终似乎还是走出来了。我不知道他是否还会想起她，我猜他会。我们偶尔会谈论她，想知道她在做什么，是否安好。我小心地不拿她来取笑他。我喜欢开玩笑，但我逐渐意识到有些玩笑是不该开的。

As I slip my suit jacket off I hear my phone start to ring. I let out a laugh as I pick it up and see Ritsuko's name on the caller ID, right on cue Rits.  
当我脱下西装外套时，听到手机开始响了。我笑着拿起手机，看到是律子打来的，真是准时啊，律子。

"Hey Rits! Calling to check in on us, are you?"  
"嘿，Rits！打电话来关心我们，是吗？"

I hear her let out a laugh on the other end, _"I just wanted to make you didn't blow your big meeting today, I know it was an important one."_  
我听到她在电话那头笑出声来，“我只是想确认你今天的大会没搞砸，我知道那很重要。”

She can't see me but I pout, "You have that little faith in me huh?"  
她看不见我，但我还是撅起了嘴，“你就这么不相信我啊？”

_"Actually I have complete faith in you which is why I know I can make a joke about it. So how did it go?"  
“实际上，我对你完全有信心，所以我才敢开这个玩笑。那么，情况如何？”_

I shrug, "About as well as could be expected for a first meeting on this sort of subject. A lot of people introducing themselves and telling us why they're important. A lot of discussion about the objectives on the meeting followed by setting estimated dates on when objectives should be confirmed by. This was followed up by discussing the arranging of further meetings between different departments to confirm more dates for meetings. A load of bureaucratic bullshit really."  
我耸耸肩，“第一次在这种话题上见面，情况还算符合预期。很多人自我介绍，告诉我们他们为什么重要。会议目标讨论了很多，然后设定了确认目标的预计日期。接着讨论了安排不同部门之间进一步会议以确认更多会议日期的事宜。基本上就是一堆官僚主义的废话。”

She lets out a chuckle, _"So no word on whether or not you guys will be allowed into Tokyo-3 or what will happen to the Emergence Facilities?"_  
她轻笑一声，“那么，关于你们是否能进入东京-3，或者紧急设施会发生什么，还没有消息吗？”

"Nope, nothing yet. It seems we have some competition when it comes to wanting to go back into Tokyo-3. Each one has different goals. Some want to do a full sweep, take as much technology from NERV that they can and build from it. Some think that they should go in, take what they can and destroy it all. Reuse the land for housing or whatever. We're somewhere in the middle."  
"不，还没有动静。看来我们在重返第三新东京市这件事上遇到了一些竞争。每个人的目标都不尽相同。有些人想要彻底搜刮一番，尽可能从 NERV 那里获取技术，并在此基础上发展。有些人则认为应该进去，能拿多少拿多少，然后将其全部摧毁。将土地重新用于住宅或其他用途。我们则处于两者之间。"

_"Well that's surprising, I'd have thought you'd want to see the entire thing destroyed."  
"这倒是挺意外的，我本以为你会希望看到整个设施被彻底摧毁。"_

I shrug, "Initially I did but after talking with Maya and some of the others they persuaded me that some of it might be of use to us. We had some pretty advanced technology and it'd be a shame for it to go to waste if we can help people. Also in the back of my mind I keep thinking… what if… well…"  
我耸耸肩，"起初我确实这么想，但和真希波以及其他一些人交谈后，他们说服了我，认为其中一些技术或许对我们有用。我们拥有相当先进的技术，如果能够帮助人们，让它白白浪费就太可惜了。而且在我内心深处，我一直在想……万一……嗯……"

_"They're gone Misato, there won't be anymore_." He voice comes through loud and clear and is in a very stern tone, _"The Angels, SEELE… it's done."_  
"他们已经消失了，美里，不会再有了。" 他的声音清晰而严厉，"使徒，SEELE……一切都结束了。"

I let out a sigh, I know she is right of course but I still feel a need to say something, "I know that but… say someone tries to carry on the things they did or… I don't know we messed something up and an Angel like thing appears. Maybe… just maybe having some of the heavier stuff around would be useful."  
我叹了口气，我知道她是对的，但我仍然觉得需要说些什么，"我知道，但是……如果有人试图继续他们所做的事情，或者……我不知道我们搞砸了什么，然后出现了类似使徒的东西。也许……只是也许，保留一些重型装备会有用。"

_"And how exactly would you define what is or isn't the right sort of stuff? It's one thing when it might benefit mankind, you're right our medical tech was far beyond what we have now as was our energy production tech but the military stuff… the Eva's…"  
"那你究竟如何定义什么是或不是合适的装备呢？当它可能造福人类时，你是对的，我们的医疗技术远超现在，能源生产技术也是如此，但军事装备……EVA……"_

"I know…" "我知道……"

_"Do you want my opinion?"  
"你想听我的意见吗？"_

"Always." "一直都想。"

_"Destroy the lot of it Misato, get rid of it all and use the land for something else. The medical tech… the energy production all relied on what we got from the FAR. Keep the Emergence Support facilities open and just let NERV and SEELE go, what happened… it can't happen again, what they need is gone so we should just get rid of the rest."  
“全部摧毁吧，美里，把它们都清除掉，用这块地做点别的。那些医疗技术……能源生产全都依赖我们从 FAR 获得的东西。保持紧急支援设施开放，让 NERV 和 SEELE 就这样消失，发生过的事……不能再重演，他们所需的一切已不复存在，所以我们应该把剩下的也一并清除。”_

"Destroy everything?" I ask in surprise, "Even the MAGI there?"  
“全部摧毁？”我惊讶地问，“连那里的 MAGI 系统也包括在内吗？”

_"Especially the Tokyo-3 MAGI, if there is anything left of it." She replies, "That's… what I'd do anyway."  
“尤其是第三新东京市的 MAGI，如果它还有什么残留的话。”她回答道，“无论如何，这是我……会采取的做法。”_

"I don't know… if I could do that. The medical tech… it could help a lot of people…"  
"我不知道……我能否做到。这项医疗技术……它可以帮助很多人……"

_"I know and that's why you're the one who'll make the decision Misato and not me. You… always knew the right way to do things."  
"我明白，这也是为什么由美里你来做决定，而不是我。你……总是知道正确的方法。"_

I smile faintly at hearing her words, "We'll see what happens when it's all documented. It could be that there is nothing of use there at all. It's been years since anyone actually went into the ruins but… I think it's worth looking at and I think it should be my people."  
听到她的话，我微微一笑，"我们会看到一切被记录下来后的结果。可能那里根本没有什么有用的东西。已经很多年没有人真正进入过那些废墟了，但是……我认为值得一看，而且我认为应该由我的人去。"

_"I'm sure it will be."_ She pauses for a moment, _"So how did things go for Shinji anyway?"_  
"我相信会的。" 她顿了一下，"那么，真嗣那边情况怎么样？"

Another sigh escapes me, "I think they went well. He seemed to enjoy the lesson but…"  
我又叹了口气，"我觉得挺好的。他看起来挺喜欢这堂课的，但是……"

_"He was scared of being recognized?"  
"他害怕被认出来吗？"_

"Yeah…" I confirm to her.  
"是啊…" 我向她确认道。

_"That's understandable, I think it's something we're all dealing with in our own way."  
"这可以理解，我想这是我们都在以自己的方式应对的事情。"_

"I'm just worried about him Rits. I don't want him to feel like he has to do this for me or for anyone else I want him to do it for himself not because I said it might be a good idea."  
"我只是担心他，Rits。我不希望他觉得必须为了我或任何人去做这件事，我希望他是为了自己，而不是因为我提过这可能是个好主意。"

_"It's entirely possible that Shinji doesn't even know himself."_ Ritsuko says, _"He probably wants to make you happy but he also enjoys playing the instrument. Our reports on him indicated that he was a natural talent with it and his teacher even said that Shinji would spend a lot of time practicing when he was younger."_  
“完全有可能真嗣自己都不清楚。” 律子说道，“他可能想让你开心，但他也喜欢弹奏乐器。我们的报告指出他在音乐方面天赋异禀，连他的老师都说真嗣小时候会花很多时间练习。”

Hearing her say that lightens my heart somewhat, "So he does enjoy it?"  
听到她这么说，我心里稍微轻松了些，“所以他确实喜欢弹奏？”

Ritsuko chuckles, "_I don't think you get to be the level Shinji was at without enjoying it. Just give him time and encouragement. I'm sure he'll figure things out for himself. He said the lesson went alright though?"_  
律子轻笑道，“我不认为能达到真嗣那样的水平会不喜欢。给他一些时间和鼓励，我相信他自己会想明白的。他说课上得还不错，对吧？”

"Yeah." I nod my head, "Well… He did mention that the instructor suggested at one point that Shinji join a group of them who all play."  
"嗯。" 我点点头，"呃… 他确实提到过，教练曾建议他加入一个他们一起玩的团队。"

_"And Shinji immediately said yes didn't he?"_ Ritsuko asks with some hint of amusement in her voice.  
"然后真嗣立刻就答应了，对吧？" 律子带着一丝戏谑的语气问道。"

"Of course." I confirm to her, "He didn't want to disappoint his instructor."  
"当然。" 我向她确认，"他不想让教练失望。"

_"Well that's just a part of who Shinji is. Maybe it'll be good for him in the long run though, he can always stop if it's too much."  
"嗯，那只是真嗣性格的一部分。不过从长远来看，这对他也许是件好事，如果感到太过沉重，他随时可以停下来。"_

"Maybe… I just don't want him to get hurt or feel he has to do things to please others. I want him to know he has a loving home and friends who won't abandon him."  
"也许吧……我只是不想让他受伤，或者觉得必须做些什么来取悦别人。我希望他知道，他有一个充满爱的家和不会抛弃他的朋友。"

_"Deep down he will know that but it's not exactly easy to break those old habits. It's something I think we're all learning but I'm sure he'll be alright."  
"他内心深处会明白的，但打破那些旧习惯并不容易。我认为我们都在学习这一点，但我确信他会没事的。"_

"I hope so… I really do." I stare down at the ground, "So how was your day anyway?"  
"我也希望如此……我真的这么希望。" 我低头盯着地面，"那么，你今天过得怎么样？"

_"Not too bad, I have a lot of marking to do this evening and I need to plan for next week's lessons but nothing I can't do. Still… if I'm being honest I do understand what Shinji is going through. I keep on thinking when I see the students and their parents that maybe one of them will recognize me… It's not as if the Akagi name is hidden away."  
"还不错，今晚我有很多批改作业的工作要做，还得为下周的课做准备，不过这些我都能应付。尽管如此……说实话，我确实理解真嗣正在经历的事情。每次看到学生和他们的家长，我都会想，也许他们会认出我来……毕竟，赤木这个姓氏并不是什么秘密。"_

I nod again, "I know… It's the same for Katsuragi. I have that feeling too from time to time but it won't happen."  
我再次点头，"我知道……对于葛城也是一样。我有时也会有那种感觉，但那不会发生的。"

_"No it won't."_ She reassures me, _"Anyway I'd better go. Maya is due back any minute. Good luck to the both of you. We should arrange something soon."_  
"不，不会的。" 她安慰我，"无论如何，我最好走了。玛雅随时可能回来。祝你们俩好运。我们应该尽快安排点什么。"

"Yeah… I'd like that. Goodbye Rits."  
"是啊……我很期待。再见，立夏。"

I can't suppress the smile on my face as I glance down at the forms in my hand once more and walk through the wonderful streets of Berlin. It's been almost six months since I arrived in this country and this city I now call home.  
当我再次低头看着手中的表格，走在柏林美丽的街道上，我无法抑制脸上的笑容。自从我来到这个国家，这座我现在称之为家的城市，已经快六个月了。

Most of my time is spent working for Fuyutsuki. I assist him in an array of administrative tasks from filing basic progress reports for his staff, taking notes during meetings he is in, I arrange appointments for him and compose e-mails for him. It's not overly difficult work but I enjoy it.  
我的大部分时间都花在为冬月先生工作上。我协助他处理一系列行政事务，从为他手下员工整理基本进度报告，到在他参加会议时做笔记，我还为他安排预约并代写电子邮件。这份工作并不特别困难，但我乐在其中。

Since I arrived Fuyutsuki has been careful to slowly educate me on the state of this world since I was last in it. He explained to me exactly what has happened since the Third Impact and the little ways in which the world has changed. He told me what it was he now did and also informed me of the status of organizations such as NERV and the group who handled me, SEELE.  
自从我来到这里，冬月先生一直小心翼翼地逐步向我介绍自上次我离开后这个世界的变化。他详细地向我解释了第三次冲击以来发生的一切，以及世界在细微之处发生的改变。他告诉我他现在的工作，并告知我诸如 NERV 和负责我的组织 SEELE 等机构的状态。

It seems that after Third Impact and people returned information was released to the public and world governments about SEELE and their role in the whole thing. Names were kept away from the public eye but it was enough that the world knew the truth about who was the true enemy. If anything I was pleased to learn that the people who were a part of NERV were alive and well.  
似乎在第三次冲击之后，随着人们回归，有关 SEELE 及其在整个事件中角色的信息被公开给公众和世界各国政府。虽然具体姓名未被公开，但足以让世界知道谁是真正的敌人。令我欣慰的是，我得知参与 NERV 的人们都安然无恙。

There are certain subjects I have dared to not ask about as of yet. These particular things have been the subject of numerous nightmares I've experienced since returning. I dare not ask what happened to Shinji Ikari, Rei Ayanami or even the other pilot who was there in my short stay. I assume from what Fuyutsuki told me about former NERV personnel being alive and well that they are okay but I don't dare go any deeper than that.  
有些话题我至今未敢触及。自从归来后，这些特定的事情就成了我无数噩梦的主题。我不敢询问真嗣·碇、绫波零，甚至是我在短暂停留期间见过的那位驾驶员发生了什么。我从冬月那里得知前 NERV 人员都安然无恙，所以我推测他们应该没事，但我并不敢深入探究。

Maybe… Maybe one day I'll work up the nerve to find out but not until I know I'm ready for it. I'm still trying to adjust to this life, one I didn't think I'd ever have. I've been given a gift, a chance to explore so many things I never knew before.  
也许……也许有一天我会鼓起勇气去了解，但前提是我确定自己已经准备好了。我仍在努力适应这种生活，一种我从未想过会拥有的生活。我被赋予了一份礼物，一个探索我以前从未知晓的众多事物的机会。

Music had of course been my first port of call. I've been able to explore numerous eras and genres beyond the classical material they forced me to listen to. The playlist Kodama gave me was a huge benefit. I took notes of each artist to listen to moments and pieces I enjoyed. It seems she put a lot of work into making that playlist, managing to cover a variety of genres, eras, artists from around the world.  
音乐自然成了我的首选。我得以探索众多时代和流派，超越了他们强迫我听的古典音乐。儿玉给我的播放列表带来了巨大的帮助。我记录了每个艺术家，以便聆听我喜欢的时刻和作品。看来她在这份播放列表上下了很多功夫，成功涵盖了世界各地的各种流派、时代和艺术家。

With my background in classical music and playing the piano I did find myself drawn towards the progressive genres of rock. I enjoy the longer tracks and slightly complex arrangements these songs offer. I also like how they made a habit of utilizing a wide array of instruments in their songs although admittedly they could be a bit obtuse lyrically although I suppose knowing the way I speak is probably another reason that the genre appeals to me.  
我自幼学习古典音乐并弹奏钢琴，因此对摇滚乐中的前卫流派情有独钟。我喜欢这些歌曲提供的较长曲目和略显复杂的编排。我也欣赏他们在歌曲中广泛运用各种乐器的习惯，尽管不可否认，歌词有时可能略显晦涩，但我想，这或许也是该流派吸引我的另一个原因，毕竟我的言谈方式也与之相仿。

Beyond that I have found I don't have much of an affinity for sports. I appreciate what various athletes and sports stars are capable of, I just don't really enjoy watching them. In fact I don't find myself watching much television at all nor have I had the chance to see a movie in a theater yet. I would like to but I don't know what it is I would watch.  
除此之外，我发现我对体育并没有太多兴趣。我虽然敬佩各类运动员和体育明星的才能，但并不热衷于观看他们的比赛。事实上，我很少看电视，也从未有机会在影院观看电影。我希望能有机会，但不知该选择什么影片。

I have also found that I quite enjoy the human act of cooking too. In my previous life I did not get an opportunity to partake of this particular pastime. As an Angel I didn't require as much food as a regular human would and being under the care of SEELE meant any meals were carefully monitored and structured to provide what my body needed. It was usually bland and functional,  
我还发现，我非常享受烹饪这一人类活动。在前世，我未曾有机会体验这一爱好。作为天使，我不需要像普通人那样进食，而 SEELE 的照料意味着我的每一餐都经过精心监控和安排，以满足身体所需。那些食物通常平淡无味，仅具功能性，

Unfortunately learning to cook came with some dangers. There had been one incident involving an errant pan and my apartment nearly burning down and another in which some undercooked meat had given me a night I don't wish to experience ever again. Yet I suppose it is a part of the learning process, I will not be the first nor the last to under-prepare meat like that.  
不幸的是，学习烹饪伴随着一些危险。曾有一次，一个失控的平底锅差点让我的公寓化为灰烬，还有一次，未煮熟的肉让我经历了一夜，我再也不想体验。然而，我想这是学习过程的一部分，我不会是第一个也不会是最后一个那样准备不足的人。

I turn onto another street and see a small coffee shop come into view. I decide that it would be a shame to go straight back to my apartment now and this place looks appealing so think it'd be a good idea to head inside and grab something to drink and relax. I clutch the forms I'm holding tightly in my hand and walk down the street.  
我拐进另一条街道，看到一家小咖啡馆映入眼帘。我觉得现在直接回公寓太可惜了，这家店看起来很吸引人，所以我认为进去喝点东西放松一下是个好主意。我紧紧抓着手里拿着的表格，沿着街道走去。

The forms I'm holding are application forms to help me on my first step towards become a music teacher. Fuyutsuki had given me the idea a few weeks ago after hearing me play the piano. He had at first suggested I find overs to play with but admittedly I do not think I would mix well with a group at this time and being honest being in larger groups scares me somewhat.  
我手里拿着的是成为音乐教师的第一步所需的申请表。几周前，冬月给了我这个建议，当时他听我弹钢琴。他起初建议我找人一起演奏，但老实说，我不认为自己现在能很好地融入一个团体，而且说实话，大型团体让我有些害怕。

Yet the more I thought about it the more I realized that one on one situations might be better suited to me and I would like, if anything, to share what I have and maybe inspire others. Fuyutsuki liked my idea and helped me find a means to getting the correct qualifications.  
然而，我越是思考，越意识到一对一的情况可能更适合我，我希望能分享我所拥有的，或许还能激励他人。冬月喜欢我的想法，并帮助我找到了获得正确资格的途径。

I look at the forms again, there are still a few things to fill out on there. My name and address are at the top but there are other questions on there. How long have I been playing? My inspirations and prior qualifications. Nothing complex but I'm very eager to fill it in and get this all started.  
我又看了看表格，还有一些地方需要填写。我的名字和地址在顶部，但还有其他问题。我玩了多久？我的灵感来源和之前的资格。虽然不复杂，但我非常渴望填写并开始这一切。

I continue to walk forward my eyes still focused on the paper until finally I hit something, not something but someone. I feel a sharp pain in my head as I connect with them, I hear a loud scream from them as I'm sent falling onto my backside and the form flies out of my hand.  
我继续前行，眼睛仍紧盯着那张纸，直到最终撞上了什么，不是东西，而是某个人。我感到头部一阵剧痛，随着与他们的碰撞，我听到一声尖叫，自己被撞倒在地，表格也从手中飞了出去。

I rub my head with my hand and hear an angry voice yell at me, "Idiot! Weren't you watching where you were going?"  
我用手揉着头，听到一个愤怒的声音对我吼道：“白痴！你没看路吗？”

I shake my head and my vision starts to come back to me, the pain however does not subside, "I apologize… are you hurt?"  
我摇了摇头，视线开始恢复，但疼痛并未减轻，“对不起……你受伤了吗？”

I slowly start to get to my feet and hold out a hand to help the fallen girl to her feet.  
我慢慢站起身，伸出一只手帮助那位摔倒的女孩站起来。

"Yeah well… just be more careful! Could have broken something!" She remarks as she gets to her feet and picks up a small laptop bag she dropped. I take a step back and for the first time I actually see the girl I walked into.  
"哎，好吧……小心点！差点就弄坏了什么东西！" 她一边说，一边站起身来，捡起她掉落的小笔记本包。我后退一步，第一次真正看清了那个我撞到的女孩。

Almost immediately I feel my eyes get wide with fear. I feel that sickly feeling in the pit of my stomach as I take in all of her features. Her shoulder length red hair, her bright blue eyes, a soft but angered expression and a thin scar over her left eye. She's older than I remember seeing her but there is no mistaking who this is.  
几乎立刻，我感到恐惧让我的眼睛瞪大。我感受到胃里那种恶心的感觉，当我注意到她所有的特征时。她齐肩的红发，明亮的蓝眼睛，柔和但带着怒意的表情，以及左眼上方的一道细疤。她比我记忆中看到的要年长，但毫无疑问，这就是她。

"N-No…" I stutter, "I-Impossible…"  
"不-不可能……" 我结巴着说，"这-这不可能……"

She looks at me in confusion, "What? Never saw a pissed off redhead before?"  
她困惑地看着我，“什么？没见过生气的红发女孩吗？”

I shake my head, "N-No… I…I'm sorry… I have to go!"  
我摇摇头，“不，不……我……我很抱歉……我得走了！”

I immediately turn around and run away from her as fast as I can. I don't stop to look back at any point until I'm several streets away. I don't know if she called after me or if she recognizes me, all I know is I have to get away from her. I have to get away from Asuka Langley Soryu, The Second Child.  
我立刻转身，尽可能快地逃离她。直到跑过几条街，我都没有回头看一眼。我不知道她是否在后面叫我，或者是否认出了我，我只知道我必须远离她。我必须远离明日香·兰格雷，第二适格者。

### Chapter 3: Lost Boy  
第三章：迷失的男孩  

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

**Berlin – Early Morning 柏林 – 清晨时分**

The nightmares came back last night. The ones in which I get found out, the ones in which the fragile social bonds I've made with people are shattered and everyone turns there back on me. The ones where I wake up crying knowing that if that did happen I'd deserve it.  
昨晚噩梦又回来了。那些梦里我被揭穿，那些梦里我与人建立的脆弱社交关系被粉碎，每个人都背弃我。那些梦里我哭着醒来，知道如果真发生了那种事，我活该。

I didn't sleep for the rest of the night, from four o'clock onwards I've been awake sitting in my front room. I tried doing some further editing to my book, that didn't happen so instead I put on a game instead. I spent the majority of the morning scoring goals past any and all opposition as I try to put what happened yesterday out of my mind.  
那一夜我再也没睡，从四点开始就一直醒着坐在客厅。我试着继续编辑我的书，但没做成，于是改玩起了游戏。整个早上我大部分时间都在攻破所有对手的防线，试图把昨天发生的事抛诸脑后。

Why did he run away from me like that? Did he know who I was? Does he know what I did? That shouldn't be possible though, I know logically it shouldn't be possible. I've spoken about it with Rei in the past, He... he has the same concerns but no one knows who we are. If they do they just know we were the Evangelion pilots who helped save the world.  
他为什么那样从我身边逃开？他知道我是谁吗？他知道我做过什么吗？这按理说不应该啊，我理智上知道这不应该。我以前和丽讨论过，他……他也有同样的担忧，但没人知道我们是谁。如果他们知道，也只晓得我们是帮助拯救世界的 EVA 驾驶员。

Yet that annoying awkward fear remains. It doesn't help that I'm seeing Rei today either. It isn't her fault, I know she is my friend but I can't help but worry each time I see her that it will be the time that our friendship is revealed to be nothing but a fraud. That she comes here with the others to tell me how much they hate me. To tell me how disgusting I am and that I deserve to be alone and abandoned. To bring up all those things I did in my past and throw it in my face. I'd deserve it aswell wouldn't I?  
然而那种恼人的尴尬恐惧依旧挥之不去。今天还要见丽，这更让我不安。我知道这不是她的错，她是我朋友，但我每次见她都不禁担心，我们的友谊会不会被揭穿只是个骗局。她会不会和其他人一起来告诉我他们有多恨我，告诉我我有多恶心，活该孤独被抛弃。会不会把我过去的所作所为都翻出来，甩在我脸上。我也该受这些，不是吗？

I shake my head and force those thoughts away. That isn't going to happen, Rei is my friend now and everything is in the past. She's told me numerous times, even with some annoyance that I'm forgiven for how I acted back then.  
我摇摇头，强迫自己抛开这些念头。不会发生的，丽现在是我的朋友，一切都过去了。她多次甚至有些不耐烦地告诉我，我当时的所作所为她已经原谅了。

It's all that guys fault, if he hadn't had ran away then I wouldn't be like this right now. No, that isn't true. I'd be like this anyway, he's just made it more prominent. I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror, I look rough. I can see the bags under my eyes and I know no amount of make-up will hide them. I've tried to make an effort but I know Rei will see through it. She always does, it's who Rei is.  
都怪那家伙，如果不是他逃走了，我现在就不会这样。不，这不是真的。无论如何我都会这样，他只是让这一切更加明显了。我从镜子里瞥了自己一眼，看起来很憔悴。眼下的黑眼圈清晰可见，我知道再多的化妆品也遮不住。我试着打扮了一下，但我知道丽会看穿这一切。她总是能看穿，这就是丽。

I finally open the door ao reveal Rei standing on the other side. She's a far cry from the dour girl I knew so many years ago. She's looking upwards, a faint smile on her face and wearing a short red skirt, complemented by a black top with a white jacket over it. In one of her hands is a bag that I recognize from one of the nearby cafes.  
我终于打开门，露出站在另一边的丽。她与我多年前认识的那个阴郁女孩相去甚远。她抬头望向天空，脸上带着淡淡的微笑，穿着一条红色短裙，搭配黑色上衣和白色夹克。她手中提着一个袋子，我认出那是附近一家咖啡馆的。

"Hello Asuka." She announces, "I brought lunch if that is alright?"  
“你好，明日香。”她宣布道，“我带了午餐，可以吗？”

I laugh and step aside to let her in, "Of course, come on in!"  
我笑着侧身让她进来，“当然可以，快请进！”

I watch her as she enters the apartment and I allow myself a smile as well. I feel happy to see the life that now exists within Rei. It's good to see she finally has the chance to have a life. I follow her through into the kitchen and watch as she places the bag up on one of the counters. I'm interested in seeing what it is she has bought, moments later she pulls out two boxes each one filled with luscious smelling pancakes.  
我看着她走进公寓，也忍不住微笑起来。看到丽现在有了生活的气息，我感到很高兴。很高兴她终于有机会过上自己的生活。我跟着她走进厨房，看着她把袋子放在其中一个台面上。我很好奇她买了什么，不一会儿，她从袋子里拿出两个盒子，每个盒子里都装满了香气扑鼻的煎饼。

My mouth starts to water at the sight of them and I step forward. Rei sees this and smiles and immediately turns herself around and pulls me into a warm but tight hug.  
看到这些煎饼，我的口水开始分泌，我向前迈了一步。丽看到了，微笑着立刻转过身来，给了我一个温暖而紧实的拥抱。

"I've missed you Asuka!" “我好想你，明日香！”

I laugh and return the hug, "I've miss you too Rei, it's been quite a while hasn't it?"  
我笑着回抱她，“我也想你，丽，真是好久不见了，对吧？”

She releases me from the hug, "Almost a year since we last met."  
她松开拥抱，“我们上次见面差不多快一年了。”

"Yeah." I say guiltily, "How was your flight?"  
“是啊。”我内疚地说，“你的航班怎么样？”

She shrugs slightly, "It was okay. I arrived late last night so I was able to get a good amount of sleep."  
她微微耸肩，“还不错。我昨晚很晚才到，所以睡了个好觉。”

"I'm glad." I reply as I go into one of my kitchen cupboards to grab some plates for our pancakes, "These smell delicious Rei."  
“那就好。”我一边回答，一边走进厨房打开橱柜拿盘子准备装我们的煎饼，“这些闻起来真香，丽。”

"They do, I was wondering what to do for lunch and saw a place selling these. I have become quite a fan of pancakes whilst being in America, I am eager to try these."  
“确实很香，我正想着午餐吃什么，就看到有地方卖这个。在美国这段时间，我成了煎饼的忠实粉丝，很期待尝试这些。”

I am as well and I get out some plates and cutlery for us. The pancakes are plain but the café Rei got them from supplied her with a variety of spreads to try with them. Rei reaches for the strawberry jam for hers, I go for the classic chocolate spread for my first one.  
我也一样，于是我拿出一些盘子和餐具为我们准备。这些煎饼是原味的，但 Rei 买它们的咖啡店提供了多种酱料供我们尝试。Rei 选择了草莓酱，而我则选择了经典的巧克力酱作为我的第一份。

"So how come you're here in Germany, I thought the plan was to travel America for a few more weeks?"  
“那么你怎么会来德国呢？我记得计划是还要在美国旅行几周的？”

"it was but I realized halfway through the trip that it was coming up to a year since I last saw you, so I sought to rectify that."  
“确实如此，但我在旅途中途意识到，自从上次见你已经快一年了，所以我决定来弥补这一点。”

I almost choke in shock, "Y-You... Rei that's too much money just to come and visit me!"  
我几乎被惊得噎住，“你...丽，这钱太多了，就为了来看我！”

She shrugs again, "I do not think so. As I said it has almost been a year and I think the chances of you visiting me and Japan are somewhat slim."  
她又耸了耸肩，“我不这么认为。正如我所说，已经快一年了，我觉得你来日本看我的可能性相当渺茫。”

That little pang of guilt I feel at hearing her say that is suppressed for a moment by me swallowing a bit of my pancake. I gave down at the counter, "Yeah well... You know why that is Rei."  
听到她这么说，我心中那丝愧疚感被咽下的一口煎饼暂时压了下去。我低头看着柜台，“是啊，好吧...丽，你知道为什么的。”

"Yes. Although I must disagree with your stance, I am sure they would like to see you again."  
"是的。虽然我不同意你的立场，但我确信他们希望再次见到你。"

"No Rei... They wouldn't like to see me." I look up at her and let out a sigh, "Look, it's... it isn't that I don't believe you it's just that... I can't see them again and that's for the best. I hurt them a lot and it's just best I stay away. They... They're better off without me in their life, I'm not a good person."  
"不，丽...他们不会想见我的。" 我抬头看着她，叹了口气，"听着，不是我不相信你，只是...我不能再见到他们，这样最好。我伤害了他们很多，最好还是保持距离。他们...没有我在他们的生活中会更好，我不是个好人。"

"I do not become friends with bad people Asuka."  
"我不会和坏人交朋友的，明日香。"

I feel my cheeks glow red, "Yeah well... maybe I'm the exception to the rule."  
"我感觉脸颊发烫，红了起来，“嗯，好吧……也许我就是那个例外。””

"I do not believe so, I believe you are being too hard on yourself."  
“我不这么认为，我觉得你对自己太苛刻了。”

I shrug, "Maybe... Maybe not... I guess... they still don't know that we're friends do they?"  
“我耸耸肩，“也许吧……也许不是……我想……他们还不知道我们是朋友，对吧？””

"I have not told them anything of our friendship and I will continue to keep this a secret for as long as you desire it. As far as they are concerned you left Japan years ago and are living comfortably and off the grid."  
"我并未向他们透露我们之间的友谊，只要你希望，我会继续保守这个秘密。在他们看来，你多年前就离开了日本，过着舒适且隐居的生活。"

"T-Thank you, I'm sorry I am making you keep this a secret."  
"谢-谢谢你，很抱歉让你替我保守这个秘密。"

"I do not mind." She replies coolly, "That is what you wish and as your friend I will not betray that wish."  
"我并不介意。" 她冷静地回答，"这是你的愿望，作为你的朋友，我不会辜负这份心愿。"

"Thank you." I nervously shift from one foot to the other, "So... how are they doing?"  
"谢谢。" 我紧张地左右脚换着重心，"那么...他们现在怎么样？"

"Misato has begun work with an organization known as WILLE. I believe that she wishes to start operations in Tokyo-3 to salvage what is left of NERV."  
"美里已经开始在一个名为 WILLE 的组织工作。我相信她希望在第三新东京市启动行动，以挽救 NERV 剩余的部分。"

Another pang in my stomach at hearing the name of NERV spoken, I quickly supress it with another chocolate covered piece of pancake. I'm nearly done with this one, I should get another. Maybe not chocolate spread this time, I might try the jam, Rei seemed to enjoy that one.  
听到 NERV 这个名字，我的胃又是一阵抽痛，我迅速用另一块裹着巧克力的煎饼压下这种感觉。这块快吃完了，我应该再拿一块。也许这次不要巧克力酱了，我可能会试试果酱，丽似乎挺喜欢那个的。

"is there even anything left to recover?" I ask, "I mean... we didn't exactly leave it in a reusable state."  
"还有什么可恢复的吗？" 我问道，"我的意思是...我们并没有让它保持在一个可再利用的状态。"

Rei nods, "NERV was much bigger than any of you... even I knew. There are parts of it that will still be there and might have something of benefit to us... or something that should be destroyed. I trust that Misato will make the right decision."  
丽点头道，"NERV 比你们任何人...甚至我都知道的还要庞大。它的一些部分仍然存在，可能对我们有益...或者有些东西应该被摧毁。我相信美里会做出正确的决定。"

"Hah, making the right decision and Misato?" I start to joke but trail off, Rei seems amused but halfway through I realize the joke just isn't funny to me, "Yeah... She will. What about... well... you know who?"  
"哈哈，做出正确决定和美里？" 我开始开玩笑，但话说到一半就停住了，丽似乎觉得有趣，但我意识到这个笑话对我来说并不好笑，"是啊...她会的。那...呃...你知道是谁吗？"

She seems to take a moment to think, "He is doing well."  
她似乎花了一会儿时间思考，“他做得很好。”

She lies to me, a strange thing about Rei is that she isn't a very good liar. She always looks off in the same direction when she does so and her hand twitches on doing so. I decide to not press her on it though. I don't have any right to be too concerned about him or know more considering who I am.  
她对我撒了谎，关于丽的一个奇怪之处是，她并不擅长撒谎。每次撒谎时，她总是朝同一个方向看，而且手会不自觉地抽动。不过我决定不去追问她。考虑到我的身份，我没有权利过于关心他或了解更多。

"He has signed up to take music lessons."  
“他已经报名参加音乐课了。”

I look at her in confusion and shock, "Music lessons? What the hell would he need music lessons for? I... I heard him years ago, he was... he was very good."  
我困惑又震惊地看着她，“音乐课？他到底需要音乐课干什么？我……我多年前听过他演奏，他……他非常出色。”

It was just a shame that I had to go and ruin his night by being... me. I force the memory away as Rei replies to me, "It has been many years since he last played so he believes his skills to be somewhat rusty. He had his first lesson yesterday but I have not yet been in contact to find out how it went."  
只是可惜我不得不破坏他的夜晚，因为我就是……我。我强迫自己忘掉这段记忆，Rei 回答我，“他已经很多年没弹奏了，所以他觉得自己的技艺有些生疏。他昨天上了第一节课，但我还没联系他了解进展如何。”

"He is doing alright though?" I ask once more, in a way hoping that maybe Rei will be more truthful with me.  
“不过他应该还好吧？”我再次问道，心里暗自希望 Rei 能对我更坦诚些。

"Yes." She replies but her tone again indicating that he isn't as good as she is letting on.  
"是的。" 她回答道，但语气再次表明他并不像她表面上显得那么出色。

"I'm glad." I finally reply, "He... He deserves to be happy."  
"我很高兴。" 我终于回答，"他... 他值得幸福。"

My hand clenches into a fist as I avert my eyes from Rei. Those little daggers of guilt appear once more as I think about him, "Especially after everything that I-"  
我的手紧握成拳，目光从丽身上移开。那些小小的内疚之箭再次出现，当我想到他时，"尤其是在经历了我所做的一切之后——"

"Asuka!" Rei cuts me off sternly. I slowly look up into those piercing red eyes of hers. They're frightening and I instantly go quiet, "You should forgive yourself for all that happened. I have told you on numerous occasisions that not only you but we were all very different people back then."  
"明日香！" 绫波严厉地打断了我。我缓缓抬起头，迎上她那双锐利的红色眼眸。它们令人畏惧，我立刻安静了下来，"你应该原谅自己所发生的一切。我多次告诉过你，不仅是你，我们那时都是截然不同的人。"

"I-" I start to protest but Rei doesn't allow me in. After Third Impact Rei did find her voice and she isn't afraid of using it.  
"我——" 我正要反驳，但绫波不给我机会。在第三次冲击之后，绫波确实找到了自己的声音，并且毫不畏惧使用它。

"You are a good person Asuka and... I know that you were back then as well. You might not have always shown it but you were. If you weren't I would not have made such an effort to find you after you left Japan."  
"你是个好人，明日香……我知道你那时也是。你可能并不总是表现出来，但你是的。如果不是这样，我不会在你离开日本后如此努力地寻找你。"

"Yeah but..." "不过但是……"

"I know you see yourself solely as the Asuka who always yelled and shouted at others, who belittled other people and believed herself to be better than other people. The Asuka who would lash out frequently."  
"我知道你只看到那个总是大喊大叫、对别人冷嘲热讽、自认为高人一等的明日香。那个经常发脾气的明日香。"

I feel so much better now.  
我现在感觉好多了。

"But that is not who you are now and not all you were back then. I can look back and see the Asuka who was brave in front of monsters that threatened this world. The Asuka who tried to encourage her teammates to do better. The Asuka who risked her life to protect her friends. A frightened Asuka who wanted to reach out to others. I saw an Asuka who was unselfish, who made an effort to include someone like me when she had no reason to. That Asuka who took us to the ramen cart that night."  
但那不是现在的你，也不是过去的全部。我可以回望，看到那个在面对威胁这个世界的怪物时勇敢的明日香。那个试图鼓励队友做得更好的明日香。那个冒着生命危险保护朋友的明日香。一个想要向他人伸出援手的恐惧的明日香。我看到了一个无私的明日香，她没有理由却努力包容像我这样的人。那个带我们去拉面摊的明日香。

I'd cry on hearing her words if that wouldn't be unbelievably pathetic of me and if I hadn't already used up my weekly supply of tears after my nightmare. So instead I blink rapidly and force the stinging feeling behind my eyes to go away. She mentioned that damn ramen cart again, she has a thing for that.  
如果我不会因此显得无比可悲，如果我在噩梦后没有用尽每周的泪水配额，我会在听到她的话时哭泣。所以我快速眨眼，强迫眼中的刺痛感消失。她再次提到了那个该死的拉面摊，她对那有特别的情感。

I laugh, "Well... Misato couldn't really afford a steak dinner and... you're vegetarian so what else was I supposed to do."  
我笑了，“嗯...美里其实负担不起牛排晚餐，而且...你是素食主义者，我还能做什么呢。

"You were not supposed to do anything. It was not your responsibility, Misato should not have made the promise if she were not able to keep it. Yet you did do something and I am grateful for it."  
"你本不该做任何事的。那不是你的责任，美里如果不能遵守承诺，就不应该做出那样的承诺。但你确实做了些什么，我对此心存感激。"

"Alright!" I try to put an end to this, "You've made your point... I guess I wasn't completely awful. Maybe only 95% awful."  
"好吧！" 我试图结束这个话题，"你已经表达了你的观点...我想我并没有完全糟糕。或许只有 95%糟糕吧。"

She glares at me, "It is an improvement I suppose."  
她瞪了我一眼，"我想这算是一种进步吧。"

I watch as she leans over to grab another pancake. She seems to stop mid motion as her eyes are drawn to something on the counter. Rei does something of a double take as she looks intently at the piece of paper I had left lying there. Her mouth opens slightly as if she is shocked and I take a step forward.  
我看着她俯身去拿另一张煎饼。她的动作似乎在半空中停住了，目光被柜台上的某样东西吸引。丽盯着那张我留在那里的纸条，做了个类似双重视线的动作。她的嘴微微张开，仿佛震惊了，我向前迈了一步。

"Rei… Is everything alright? You've been looking at that piece of paper for nearly a minute now."  
“丽……一切都好吗？你已经盯着那张纸条看了一分钟了。”

She looks up at me and her expression as changed, it's hardened and for a brief moment I wonder if this is it. Is this finally the moment she is going to call me out for all the bad I've done just as I deserve. Naturally she doesn't do that, she instead picks up the piece of paper and holds it in front of me.  
她抬头看向我，表情变了，变得坚硬。有那么一瞬间，我在想这是不是就是那个时刻。她会不会终于要因为我所做的坏事而指责我，正如我所应得的那样。当然，她没有那么做，而是拿起那张纸条，举到我面前。

"This document, where did you get it?"  
"这份文件，你从哪儿弄来的？"

I look at the document she is holding and my heart starts to beat faster in my chest. It's the one that guy dropped yesterday. I can see his name written at the top followed by an address. I don't know why I picked it up, after what happened I probably should have left it there but it looked important. I was going to post it.  
我看着她手中的文件，心跳不由得加速。那是昨天那个男人掉落的，上面写着他的名字和一个地址。我不知道为什么捡了起来，经历了那些事后，我本该让它留在原地，但它看起来很重要。我原本打算寄出去的。

I lean casually on the counter trying to not show any trace of being bothered by Rei holding it up to me or by my memories of yesterday.  
我随意地靠在柜台上，试图不显露出被丽拿着文件质问或昨日记忆所困扰的痕迹。

"Oh that?" I shrug, "I... found it yesterday... some guy was coming into the café I was working in and he didn't look to see where he was going. Idiot bumped right into me and sent us both spilling to the ground. He left and dropped it."  
"哦，那个吗？" 我耸耸肩，"我……昨天发现的……有个家伙走进我打工的咖啡馆，他没看路。笨蛋直接撞上了我，结果我们俩都摔倒了。他走了，还掉了这个。"

Rei is eying me oddly, does she know what happened? Rei has a weird sense of just knowing things from time to time. She looks at the name on the form as if confirming what it says, "You... met this guy? Did anything else happen?"  
丽正用奇怪的眼神看着我，她知道发生了什么吗？丽有时候有种奇怪的直觉，能从一些事情中察觉到什么。她看着表格上的名字，仿佛在确认上面写的是什么，"你……见过这个人吗？还发生了别的事吗？"

I swallow and nod, "Well he... looked at me and he got frightened... he ran away from me. He didn't stop to pick it up he just ran. I... He knew who I was... He knew me Rei, he was frightened of me and he..."  
我咽了咽口水，点点头，"嗯，他……看了我一眼，然后就害怕了……他逃离了我。他没有停下来捡起它，只是跑了。我……他认识我……他认识我，丽，他害怕我，他……"

In a blur of motion Rei sets the form down on the table and moved into wrap me in another of her warm hugs. I don't even try to resist and I put my arms around her and rest my head on her should. I can feel myself on the verge of tears again, "He knew who I was... I've been found out Rei... I've been..."  
"在一阵模糊的动作中，丽将表格放在桌上，随即又用她温暖的拥抱将我环绕。我甚至没有试图抵抗，只是伸出双臂环抱住她，将头靠在她的肩上。我感到自己再次濒临泪水的边缘，“他知道我是谁...我被发现了，丽...我被...””

Rei shakes her head, "No... No, you haven't Asuka. You don't recognize the name on that form do you?"  
"丽摇了摇头，“不...不，你没有，明日香。你不认识表格上的那个名字，对吧？””

Still in her embrace I shake my head, "No... Why would I?"  
"在她怀中，我摇了摇头，“不...我为什么要认识？””

"Asuka that person you met… Kaworu Nagisa, he was the Fifth Child and… he was the final Angel." She informs me darkly and I feel my stomach drop, "I… I need to make a phone call."  
“明日香，你遇到的那个人……渚薰，他是第五适格者，而且……他是最后的使徒。”她阴沉地告诉我，我感到胃里一阵翻腾，“我……我需要打个电话。”

Rei breaks the hug and starts to walk towards her handbag. I reach out and grab her wrist before she can make any motion. I can't let her make a phone call just yet. I need to know more, what does she mean he was the Fifth Child? What does she mean he was the final Angel?  
绫波挣脱了拥抱，开始走向她的手提包。我伸出手抓住她的手腕，阻止她任何动作。我还不能让她打电话。我需要了解更多，她说的第五适格者是什么意思？她说的最后的使徒又是什么意思？

That person who recognized me yesterday was an Eva pilot? That person knew me because of that? I certainly didn't know him so how is that possible. I need to know more information and... I know it's selfish of me considering what she said but I can't let anyone know I'm here.  
昨天认出我的那个人是 EVA 驾驶员？那个人因为那个原因认识我？我当然不认识他，这怎么可能。我需要更多信息，而且……我知道考虑到她说的那些话，我很自私，但我不能让任何人知道我在这里。

"Wait!" I tell her, "No phonecalls, not yet."  
"等等！" 我告诉她，"现在还不能打电话。"

She looks at me, "Asuka, this is serious. He was…"  
她看着我，"明日香，这很严重。他曾是……"

I nod my head, "I know and I believe you Rei it's just… I need to know more first. What do you mean he was both the Fifth Child and the final Angel?"  
我点点头，"我知道，我相信你，丽，只是……我需要了解更多。你说他既是第五适格者又是最后的使徒是什么意思？"

I keep my hand in place and continue to look at Rei. She stares back at me before finally relaxing her pose and putting her handbag on the counter. She walks out of the kitchen into the front room where we both sit opposite one another on the seating. She sighs before looking at me, "I apologize, I… forgot that your memory of that time period is not complete."  
我保持手的位置不变，继续看着丽。她回望着我，最终放松了姿势，将手提包放在柜台上。她走出厨房，来到我们面对面坐在座位上的前厅。她叹了口气，然后看着我说：“我道歉，我……忘记了你对那段时间的记忆并不完整。”

I shake my head, "It's fine, it's not like I ever asked for those blanks to be filled in before. Not really a period of time I want to remember. Start from the beginning, who is Kaworu Nagisa?"  
我摇摇头，“没关系，我以前从未要求填补这些空白。那并不是我想回忆的时期。从头开始，碇真嗣是谁？”

Rei pauses and seems to be deep in thought for a few moments. I can imagine she is finding it tough to come up with the right words to say to me, so I decide to make it easier for her, "The Fifth Child… Shinji was the Third, Touji was the Fourth but he was injured during the activation test so the Fifth Child would have been my replacement right?"  
丽停顿了一下，似乎陷入了深深的思考。我能想象她在努力寻找合适的词句对我说，所以我决定让她更容易些，“第五个孩子……真嗣是第三个，东治是第四个，但他在启动测试中受伤了，所以第五个孩子应该是我的替代者，对吧？”

Rei nods, "Yes… He turned up around the time you…"  
丽点点头，“是的……他出现在你……”

Again I step in to make things easier, "After I ran away and tried to… kill myself?"  
我又一次介入，试图让事情变得简单些，“在我逃跑并试图……自杀之后？”

She nods again and edges closer to me holding out her hand. I place mine on top of hers and tighten around it, "It's alright Rei… I know… what I tried to do. We don't need to avoid the subject."  
她再次点头，并向我靠近，伸出她的手。我将手放在她的手上并握紧，“没事的，丽……我知道……我试图做的事。我们不需要回避这个话题。”

"You are correct, Kaworu was your replacement and arrived shortly after you were found and hospitalized. He immediately befriended Shinji. Shinji was in a very bad place at that time. He had discovered the truth of what I was and had just witnessed me die and become a different person. His friends had left Tokyo-3, you were hurt, Misato wasn't around…It was very easy for someone like Kaworu to manipulate him."  
"你说得没错，渚薰是你的替代者，在你被发现并送医后不久就来到了这里。他很快就和真嗣成为了朋友。那时的真嗣正处于非常糟糕的状态。他发现了我的真实身份，亲眼目睹了我死去并变成了另一个人。他的朋友们离开了第三新东京市，你受了伤，美里也不在身边……像渚薰这样的人很容易操纵他。"

There was genuine venom in Rei's words as she spoke of the boy. It's a little bit unnerving if I'm being honest, I've heard the girl get angry and frustrated before but never anything like this.  
丽提到那个男孩时，话语中确实带着真正的恶意。说实话，这有点让人不安，我以前听过这女孩生气和沮丧，但从未像这样。

"Manipulate him? How so?"  
"操纵他？怎么个操纵法？"

"He became friends with Shinji. He told Shinji things that he wanted to hear and Shinji fell for it and I believe for him."  
"他和真嗣成了朋友。他告诉真嗣他想听的话，真嗣信以为真，我相信他也是。"

"Fell for him?" I ask in some shock, "You mean…"  
"信以为真？" 我有些震惊地问，"你是说…"

I trail off unsure of how to phrase my question. I would not be entirely surprised if he was not in fact heterosexual but the truth was in the time I knew him I never known him to show a romantic interest in anyone, except of course… for those brief fleeting moments when we kissed and when we encountered each other in Third Impact.  
我话没说完，不确定如何表达我的疑问。如果他实际上不是异性恋，我也不会完全惊讶，但说实话，在我认识他的这段时间里，我从没见过他对任何人表现出浪漫的兴趣，当然，除了…那些短暂而转瞬即逝的时刻，我们接吻的时候，以及在第三次冲击中相遇的时候。

Rei nods again, "I do not doubt that there was some romantic attachment on the part of Shinji. Whether it is because of Kaworu appearing at the right time or not I do not know. My brother has never shown any romantic or sexual interest in anyone. I wanted to say or do something at the time but things were very muddle for me in my third body… Also given what Shinji has just discovered about me I did not feel he would trust me."  
丽再次点头，“我不怀疑真嗣对渚薰有某种浪漫情感。至于这是否因为渚薰恰逢其时出现，我不得而知。我弟弟从未对任何人表现出浪漫或性方面的兴趣。当时我想说些什么或做些什么，但我的第三使徒形态让我感到非常混乱……而且，鉴于真嗣刚刚发现我的秘密，我觉得他不会信任我。”

"So what happened?" “那后来发生了什么？”

"Barely a couple of days after he arrived Kaworu snuck into NERV and hijacked Unit 02. His Angel form allowed him to manipulate the Eva and he used it to descend towards Central Dogma."  
“他到达后不过几天，渚薰就潜入了 NERV 并劫持了二号机。他的使徒形态使他能够操控 EVA，并利用它向中央教条区降落。”

Anger flares up inside of me at hearing Rei say this, not so much at the betrayal but at the fact that he used my Unit 02 to do it. How dare he do such a thing, how dare he takes what was mine!  
听到丽这么说，我心中怒火中烧，倒不是因为背叛，而是他用我的零二号机做了这件事。他怎么敢这样做，怎么敢夺走属于我的东西！

"On reaching Central Dogma he found out that he was standing in front of Lilith and now Adam like he thought. He realized that much like he had used Shinji, SEELE had used him and meant for him to fulfil his role in their plan and die. It was Shinji who dealt the final blow. It… broke Shinji. Kaworu wasn't human but he looked, sounded and smelled human. He was much more human than I was, Shinji not only had to deal with the loss and betrayal of a friend but with killing what was a living person."  
到达中央教条区后，他发现自己正站在莉莉丝和亚当面前，正如他所料。他意识到，就像他利用了真嗣一样，SEELE 也利用了他，意图让他完成他们在计划中的角色并死去。是真嗣给予了最后一击。那……击垮了真嗣。渚薰虽非人类，但他看起来、听起来、闻起来都像人类。他比我更像人类，真嗣不仅要面对朋友的失去和背叛，还要面对杀死一个活生生的人的事实。

I lower my eyes, I know what happened after this. I know the events afterwards, "I see, no wonder he…"  
我垂下眼帘，我知道这之后发生了什么。我知道后续的事件，“我明白了，难怪他会……”

I can remember those moments before Third Impact quite clearly. Being in my Eva and fighting, waiting, hoping that he would show up to save the day. I had never wanted it to happen so badly but it wasn't to be. I died on that day except… I didn't really die. Instead I was pulled into Instrumentality and forced to relive moments and try to untangle the mess of my fucked up life.  
我清晰地记得第三次冲击前的那些时刻。身处我的 Eva 中战斗、等待，期盼着他能出现拯救一切。我从未如此渴望它发生，但终究未能如愿。那天我死了，然而……我并没有真正死去。相反，我被卷入了人类补完计划，被迫重温那些瞬间，试图解开我那混乱不堪的生活。

I feel Rei's warm hand tighten around mine, "I apologize for making you relive your memories of those moments. I know they are painful, they are for me too. If you wish I will go."  
我感到丽温暖的手紧紧握住我的，“我为让你重温那些记忆而道歉。我知道它们很痛苦，对我来说也是如此。如果你愿意，我会离开。”

I look up at her and shake my head, "No please… stay. I'm glad you're here it's just… a lot to take in. I just… I didn't know about any of this. No one told me and I never bothered to ask. It just… puts a lot of things in perspective now."  
我抬头看着她，摇了摇头，“不，请……留下来。我很高兴你在这里，只是……这一切难以消化。我只是……我对此一无所知。没人告诉我，我也从未问过。现在……这让我对很多事情有了新的认识。”

As I speak I hear my voice start to tremble slightly. I blink away the tears again, in some way my heart feels somewhat lighter at hearing the strange tale of Kaworu Nagisa. He did recognize me and he must have been frightened of me but not for the reasons I thought, it was because he must have thought I knew what he did and I'd hurt him.  
当我说话时，我听到自己的声音开始微微颤抖。我再次眨去泪水，不知为何，听到渚薰那奇异的故事，我的心感到一丝轻松。他确实认出了我，他一定被我吓到了，但不是我以为的原因，而是因为他一定以为我知道他所做的事，我会伤害他。

I look up at Rei's frowning face and feel that if I were to hurt Kaworu I'd have to get into a queue behind Rei. The only thing is I have no wish to hurt him, I don't want to be that angry person, I don't want to hurt people anymore even if they do deserve it in some way.  
我抬头看着绫波皱眉的脸，感觉如果要伤害渚薰，我得排在绫波后面。唯一的问题是，我并不想伤害他，我不想成为那个愤怒的人，我不想再伤害任何人，即使他们某种程度上应受惩罚。

I don't really understand why Kaworu would have ran from me though. If he is an Angel then why would he be afraid fo a human like me.  
我不太明白为什么渚薰会从我身边逃开。如果他是使徒，那他为什么会害怕像我这样的人类。

"He must have… known who I was yesterday then. That's why he ran like that but… if why would he run?" I ask Rei to see if maybe she knows.  
"他昨天肯定……知道我是谁了。所以他才那样跑掉，但是……如果他为什么要跑呢？" 我问丽，看她是否可能知道。

"I do not know." Rei replies to me, "I do not know why he is alive right now but I wish to find out. I also want to make sure no harm comes to you or anyone. He will not hurt one of my friends again."  
"我不知道。" 丽回答我，"我不知道他为什么现在还活着，但我希望能弄清楚。我也想确保你或任何人不受伤害。他不会再伤害我的朋友了。"

I muster up a grin, "I can take care of myself Rei. I'll… let you make your phone call, just… don't… mention… if you can."  
我勉强挤出一个笑容，"我能照顾好自己，丽。我会……让你打你的电话，只是……别……提到……如果可以的话。"

"Do not worry, I will be sure to not mention your involvement in this."  
"别担心，我保证不会提及你在这件事中的参与。"

"Thank you." "谢谢你。"

**Misato Katsuragi 葛城美里**

**Tokyo-2 – Early Evening  东京-2 —— 傍晚时分**

I leave the small meeting room and head straight down the corridor towards my temporary office. The meeting was admittedly not quite as productive as I'd have hoped. A lot of the focus was on them questioning me and my actions during the war against the Angels.  
我离开那间小会议室，径直沿着走廊走向我的临时办公室。坦白说，这次会议并没有我期望的那么有成效。大部分时间他们都围绕着我在对抗使徒战争中的行为对我进行质询。

I know why they did it, they want to find out who I am, who I was and whether I'm worthy enough to accomplish what I need to do. They want to see if I'm capable and strong enough and want to see if my personal feelings aren't getting in the way. They want to make me look stupid so they can all get their people in there and freeze us out.  
我明白他们的意图，他们想弄清楚我是谁，我过去是谁，以及我是否有能力完成我需要做的事情。他们想确认我是否足够能干和坚强，同时也要看看我的个人情感是否会成为障碍。他们试图让我显得愚蠢，以便他们能安插自己的人进来，把我们排挤出去。

I can't say I didn't expect any of it though, it was something that I discussed in length with Maya and the others before we decided to go into this. So, I did my best to remain calm and focused. I answered any and all questions as professionally as I could. I deflected when I was able to and tried to keep everything on track to what to do with Tokyo-3.  
虽然我不能说我完全没有预料到这些，但在我们决定进入这个领域之前，我已经和真希波和其他人详细讨论过了。因此，我尽力保持冷静和专注。我尽可能专业地回答了所有问题。当我能够时，我会巧妙地转移话题，并试图将一切保持在处理第三新东京市的轨道上。

In a way I am still questioning why I'm doing this. Maybe my personal feelings are getting in the way somehow but Fuyutsuki persuaded me I was the best person for it and I'd make the right decisions. He wants me to do this and I believed him.  
在某种程度上，我仍然在质疑自己为什么要这样做。也许我的个人情感在某种程度上影响了判断，但冬月说服了我，我是最适合做这件事的人，我会做出正确的决定。他希望我这样做，我相信他。

It isn't as if no progress was made during the meeting though. We now have a date for the next meeting and we know that each interested party will be presenting their team to do an exploratory sweep of the abandoned zone. I've already selected Maya and Makoto as my team. If there are any people best suited for it it'd be those two. Ritsuko would have course been an ideal candidate too but nothing will persuade her to join us. She seems happy teaching at a local school now and I can't blame her.  
尽管如此，会议并非毫无进展。我们现在有了下一次会议的日期，并且知道每个感兴趣的团体都将派出他们的团队对废弃区域进行勘察。我已经选定了真希波和真琴作为我的团队。如果有最适合的人选，那一定是他们两个。律子当然也是一个理想的人选，但没有什么能说服她加入我们。她现在似乎很高兴在当地学校教书，我不能责怪她。

As I enter the office I feel my phone vibrating in my bad. I quickly pull it out and glance at the caller ID. It's Rei, that's unusual, I thought that she was enjoying herself in America at this moment. Why would she be calling me now?  
当我走进办公室时，感觉到手机在包里震动。我迅速掏出手机，瞥了一眼来电显示。是丽，这很奇怪，我以为她现在正在美国享受呢。她为什么现在给我打电话？

Hoping everything is alright I answer, "Hello, Rei? Is everything alright?"  
希望一切都好，我接起电话，“喂，丽？一切都好吗？”

There is a small pause and I hear the sound of a door closing, "Hello Misato, everything is fine."  
电话那头稍稍停顿了一下，我听到了关门的声音，“你好，美里，一切都好。”

I relax my shoulders and breathe out a sigh of relief, "Oh good! How is America?"  
我放松了肩膀，松了一口气，“哦，太好了！美国那边怎么样？”

There is another brief pause, "I am not currently in America. I am actually in Germany right now, Berlin to be precise."  
又是一阵短暂的停顿，“我现在不在美国。实际上，我现在在德国，准确地说是在柏林。”

"Berlin?" I exclaim, what the hell is Rei doing in Berlin?  
“柏林？”我惊呼道，Rei 到底在柏林干什么？

"What are you doing in Berlin?" I ask her, I already have a suspicion, one I've had for quite some time but I've never spoken or asked about it. It's a bit of an unwritten rule in our home that we don't speak of certain things. I wonder if... Well I doubt Rei will say one way or the other.  
"你在柏林做什么？" 我问她，我心里已经有了一个猜测，这个猜测我已经揣摩了很久，但从未提起或询问过。在我们家里，有些事情是不成文的规定，我们不谈论。我在想，如果……嗯，我怀疑丽不会明确表态。

"America bored me." She replied, "So I decided to come to Europe instead. It was something of an impulsive decision I made yesterday."  
"美国让我感到无聊。" 她回答道，"所以我决定来欧洲。这是昨天我一时冲动做出的决定。"

"Oh." I shrug casually, "As long as you're alright."  
"哦。" 我随意地耸了耸肩，"只要你没事就好。"

"I am doing fine but... there is a reason I am calling you. Since arriving I have... seen something..."  
"我一切都好，但是...我打电话给你是有原因的。自从到达这里，我...看到了一些东西..."

I feel a little pang of nervousness in my stomach as she says that. My mind immediately begins to wander to dark places, I can't help it. I worry about her, I know she is sensible, probably the most sensible out of all of us and she is incredibly mature too considering she has only really started to explore her own humanity over the last few years but she is not invincible.  
听到她这么说，我感到一丝紧张在胃里翻腾。我的思绪立刻飘向了阴暗的角落，我无法控制。我担心她，我知道她很理智，可能是我们中最理智的一个，而且考虑到她只是在过去几年才开始真正探索自己的人性，她的成熟程度也令人难以置信，但她并非无懈可击。

Added with the fact that she is currently in Germany I begin to run over other worst-case scenarios. That thing which we don't speak of, is it something to do with that? Has Rei seen her? Is...  
再加上她现在在德国，我开始设想其他最坏的情况。那个我们不提的东西，是和它有关吗？丽是否看到了她？还是...

My own thoughts are cut off by Rei speaking, "Kaworu Nagisa is alive."  
我的思绪被丽的话语打断，“渚薰还活着。”

My jaw drops, that was certainly not what I was expecting to hear. In a million years I would not have ran that scenario through my head. I find myself unable to say anything in response to her. In a way I'm relieved that it was not one of the things I had thought of, in another I'm terrified knowing what this could represent.  
我惊得下巴都掉了，这绝对不是我预料中的答案。就算给我一百万年，我也想不到会是这种情况。我发现自己无法回应她。一方面，我松了口气，因为这不是我之前想到的任何一种可能；另一方面，我感到恐惧，因为这可能意味着什么。

"Misato are you there?" “美里，你在吗？”

Rei's voice brings me back down to Earth, I have to make sure she did in fact say what I thought she did.  
丽的声音将我拉回现实，我必须确认她确实说了我以为她说的那句话。

"Rei... Can you repeat that please?"  
“丽……你能再说一遍吗？”

"Yes. Kaworu Nagisa is alive."  
“是的。渚薰还活着。”

Kaworu Nagisa... A name I haven't heard of in a long time. If that other subject is not spoken about in our home then the subject of Kaworu is even more complicated. My mind immediately wanders to Shinji and how he would react to this news. I know exactly how Shinji feels about Kaworu. I know Shinji still harbours feelings of guilt towards what he did, towards what he had to do. I can understand it though, killing someone is not a pleasant thing... even if they are your enemy.  
渚薰...一个我许久未曾听闻的名字。如果家里不提及另一个话题，那么关于渚薰的话题则更为复杂。我的思绪立刻飘向了真嗣，想象他会如何回应这个消息。我清楚真嗣对渚薰的感情。我知道真嗣仍对所做之事心怀愧疚，对不得不做的事感到内疚。我能理解，毕竟，杀人绝非愉快之事...即便对方是敌人。

"Okay Rei..." I try to focus myself and make an attempt to switch to Major Katsuragi mode, "Tell me more, when did you see him? How did you see him? Are you certain it was him?"  
“好的，绫波...”我努力集中精神，试图切换到葛城美里少校模式，“告诉我更多，你何时见到他的？如何见到的？你确定是他吗？”

So Rei tells me, keeping her words short and to the point, "I saw him yesterday, he was entering a small café in the city but I do not recall the name. I am certain it was him, there is no mistaking that."  
绫波简洁明了地告诉我：“我昨天见到他，他正进入城里的一家小咖啡馆，但我不记得名字了。我确信是他，绝不会认错。”

"Right." I nod my head, "And did he see you at all?"  
"好的。" 我点点头，"那他有没有看到你？"

"No."

"Good." I nod again, "Look Rei, I know you're on holiday but I'm going to ask you to cut it short. I want you to come back to Japan as soon as you can, I'm going to find out more about this."  
"很好。" 我又点了点头，"听着，丽，我知道你在度假，但我希望你能提前结束。我想让你尽快回日本，我要查清楚这件事。"

"Understood." "明白了。"

"Goodbye Rei, see you soon."  
"再见，丽，很快见。"

"See you soon Misato." "很快见，美里。"

Rei hangs up the phone and I stand there in disbelief for at least a minute. Kaworu Nagisa is back on this Earth and has somehow found himself in Berlin. That one thing I have been afraid of for so long has happened. If Nagisa is back then what else does that mean? Does it mean more Angels can return? Does it mean SEELE are back?  
丽挂断电话，我站在那里难以置信至少一分钟。渚薰回到了地球，不知怎么地出现在柏林。那个我长久以来一直害怕的事情发生了。如果薰回来了，那还意味着什么？是否意味着更多使徒能够回归？是否意味着 Seele 也回来了？

I try to focus my thoughts, there is no point jumping to conclusions just yet. What I need to do is gather information first if I rush into doing something then people are going to get hurt, most of all that kid who is sitting back in my apartment right now. I need to protect him most of all.  
我试图集中思绪，现在就急于下结论毫无意义。我需要先收集信息，如果贸然行动，人们会受到伤害，尤其是现在正坐在我公寓里的那个孩子。我最需要保护的就是他。

So, what do I do now? There are a few people I can contact but I suppose my first port of call will be the person I always turn to for advice. I'll start with her, she might know something before I go further down the rabbit hole.  
那么，我现在该怎么办？有几个我可以联系的人，但我想我的首选应该是我总是寻求建议的那个人。我会先找她，也许在我进一步深入之前，她已经知道些什么了。

It doesn't take long before answers the phone. She sounds happy and I immediately feel bad for what I'm about to say, "Hello MIsato, just finished your meeting I'm guessing."  
电话很快就被接通了。她的声音听起来很高兴，我立刻为自己即将说的话感到内疚，“你好，美里，我猜你的会议刚结束吧。”

I don't greet her, "Ritsuko, Kaworu Nagisa is back."  
我没有向她打招呼，“律子，渚薰回来了。”

There is silence and I imagine her in very much a similar state to what I was when Rei told me. Her voice comes back moments later, "Can you repeat that?"  
一片寂静，我想象着她的状态与我听到绫波告诉我时相似。片刻后，她的声音传来，“你能再说一遍吗？”

"Kaworu Nagisa is back." “渚薰回来了。”

She isn't silent this time, "Are you sure? How do you know?"  
这次她没有沉默，“你确定吗？你怎么知道的？”

"Rei just phoned to tell me, she is currently in Berlin and she saw him."  
“丽刚刚打电话告诉我，她目前在柏林，并且看到了他。”

"When?" “什么时候？”

"Some point yesterday, he was entering a café there. He didn't see her though fortunately."  
"昨天某个时刻，他正走进那里的咖啡馆。不过幸运的是，他没看到她。"

"You're sure she didn't just make a mistake."  
"你确定她不是搞错了。"

"Ritsuko, this is Rei we're talking about here, if she says she saw him then we can be sure of it. Besides... how many people do you think there are who look like Kaworu Nagisa?"  
"律子，我们说的是绫波，如果她说她看到了他，那我们就可以确信。再说...你觉得有多少人长得像渚薰？"

"True..." Ritsuko pauses for a moment, "I don't understand though, how can he be back? He was..."  
"真的..." 赤木律子顿了一下，"不过我不明白，他怎么可能回来了？他曾经..."

"An Angel?" I finish Ritsuko's sentence for her, "I don't know Rits, I was hoping you might know something."  
"成了天使？" 我替赤木律子说完这句话，"我不知道，律子，我本以为你可能知道些什么。"

"I'm afraid I can't really help you, I know nothing about him either. His name came up on reports back then but that was literally just it, a name and a date of birth. I didn't have access to any further information on him, you know how NERV was and by the time he arrived I wasn't exactly in good standing with others..."  
"恐怕我也帮不上忙，关于他我也一无所知。他的名字和出生日期当时出现在报告上，但也就仅此而已。我没有权限获取更多关于他的信息，你知道 NERV 那时的状况，而且他出现时，我与其他人的关系并不融洽..."

I bow my head at hearing her say that, in my panic to try to learn more I had forgotten just what had happened to Ritsuko at that point in time. With the way she carries herself now it's easy to forget that she was deep into her own personal hell back then too."  
听到她这么说，我低下头，在急于了解更多情况时，我忘记了那时丽津子经历了什么。现在她这样从容不迫，很容易让人忘记她当时也深陷个人地狱。

"I know... Sorry." “我知道……对不起。”

"It's fine, out of all the people back then I am the one most likely to know something. The best I can offer is that Kaworu seemed to be similar to Rei, a hybrid of Angel and human, he was also a part of SEELE's dummy plug system."  
“没关系，在那时的人中，我最有可能知道一些事情。我能提供的最好信息是，渚薰似乎和绫波零类似，是天使与人类的混血，他也是 SEELE 的傀儡系统的一部分。”

"So like Rei... he would have had spares..."  
"就像丽...他应该有备用品..."

"Exactly. Although anything like that would have been kept in SEELEs main strongholds which were raided years ago. I don't remember them finding anything like that."  
"没错。尽管这类东西应该都存放在 SEELE 的主要据点，而这些据点多年前就被突袭了。我不记得他们找到过类似的东西。"

"Well if they did they could have kept it secret, Rei and Kaworu... were miracles of science really. I imagine a lot of people would want to keep hold of that sort of thing." My mind then leaps immediately to the worst case, "You don't think that... SEELE might still be..."  
"如果他们真的找到了，可能会保密。丽和薰...确实是科学的奇迹。我想很多人都会想保留这种东西。"" 我的思绪立刻跳到了最坏的情况，""你不会认为...SEELE 可能还在..."

"We shouldn't jump to conclusions yet." Ritsuko says to me, "I'm just offering one possibility, there are others. He could have... returned just like Rei did."  
"我们还不应该急于下结论。" 律子对我说，"我只是提出一种可能性，还有其他的。他可能...就像丽一样回来了。"

I know she is right, I shouldn't leap to the worst-case scenario but I want to prepare myself just in case. There is a brief pause before she speaks again, "Are you going to tell Shinji?"  
我知道她是对的，我不应该直接想到最坏的情况，但我想要做好准备以防万一。短暂的停顿后，她再次开口，"你要告诉真嗣吗？"

"No... Not yet, he's... having a tough time at the moment with the music lessons thing and I don't want to add to that. Until I learn more I think I'll keep this quiet."  
"不...暂时不告诉他，他...现在因为音乐课的事情已经很艰难了，我不想再给他增加负担。在我了解更多之前，我想我会保持沉默。"

"A wise decision." She pauses again, "Speak to Fuyutsuki, I know you don't like dealing with him and... well I'm not a fan either but he does seem to be genuinely trying to help. If anyone is likely to know something it'll be him."  
"明智的决定。" 她再次停顿，"去找冬月谈谈，我知道你不喜欢和他打交道，而且……好吧，我也不太喜欢他，但他似乎确实在努力帮忙。如果有人可能知道些什么，那一定是他。"

I sigh, "I know... Fuyutsuki it is then. Bye Rits."  
我叹了口气，"我知道了……那就找冬月吧。再见，律子。"

"Goodbye Misato and... good luck."  
"再见，美里，还有……祝你好运。"

**Kaworu Nagisa 渚薰**

**Berlin – Mid Afternoon 柏林 – 午后时分**

I shift myself around on my seat trying to get comfortable and reach across the desk for my cup of coffee. My fingertips grace the top of the plastic cup and I gently grip and lift it. I raise it slightly from the desk when a sudden knock at the door causes me to jump in fright. I let out a noise and drop the cup, it falls to the desk, some of the contents spilling onto my hand and the rest down the desk onto the floor below.  
我挪动着身体，试图在座位上找到一个舒适的姿势，然后伸手去拿桌上的咖啡杯。我的指尖轻触到塑料杯的顶部，轻轻握住并将其提起。当我正要将杯子从桌上稍稍举起时，突然的敲门声让我吓了一跳。我发出一声惊呼，杯子从手中滑落，掉在桌上，一些咖啡溅到了我的手上，剩下的则顺着桌子流到了地板上。

I look up and see Fuyutsuki enter the office, he looks around briefly taking in the sight of the mess I've made and then the sight of me clutching my hand in pain, "Nagisa! Are you alright?"  
我抬头看见冬月走进办公室，他环顾四周，目光扫过我制造的混乱，然后看到我痛苦地紧握着手，“渚！你还好吗？”

I nod my head angrily, annoyed at myself for letting this happen and ending with me looking like an idiot in front of Fuyutsuki. Ever since last night I've been a bag of nerves. I barely got any sleep last night and I've been unable to focus on anything so far today. I keep on shaking and every noise is getting to me. Coming into work was a struggle, I keep on expecting to see her wherever I go, I keep on expecting to see the others and expecting them to give me what I deserve.  
我愤怒地点头，对自己让这种情况发生并在冬月面前显得像个傻瓜感到恼火。自从昨晚以来，我一直紧张不安。昨晚我几乎没怎么睡，今天一整天都无法集中注意力。我一直在发抖，每一个噪音都让我心烦意乱。来上班是一场挣扎，我走到哪里都期待看到她，我走到哪里都期待看到其他人，期待他们给我应得的。

Fuyutsuki takes a look at my hand and shakes his head, "Wait here I'll go and get you a cloth. I don't think you've burnt anything."  
冬月看了看我的手，摇了摇头，“在这儿等着，我去给你拿块布。我觉得你没有烫伤什么。”

I nod again as Fuyutsuki leaves the office and slips into the kitchen down the corridor. In the meantime I sit myself down on my seat and let out a sigh as I watch the spilled coffee drip off of the desk onto the floor. I suppose I should think myself lucky that it didn't hit anything on my desk.  
我再次点头，看着冬月离开办公室，悄悄走进走廊尽头的厨房。与此同时，我坐回自己的座位，叹了口气，看着洒出的咖啡从桌面上滴落到地板上。我想我应该庆幸它没有溅到桌上的任何东西。

As I sit and wait for Fuyutsuki to return my mind once again replays the scene from yesterday. My unfortunate encounter with the former Second Child, Asuka Langley Soryu. I find myself asking a number of questions about it, what was she doing here? Is anyone else here with her? Did she even recognize me?  
当我坐着等待冬月回来时，昨天的那一幕再次在我脑海中重演。我与前二号适格者，惣流·明日香·兰格雷不幸的相遇。我不禁对这次遭遇提出了一系列问题，她在这里做什么？还有其他人跟她在一起吗？她是否认出了我？

I try to think about what I know about her. I know she is originally from Germany but from what I understood she had made Japan her home as a pilot. I only had access to minimal files on her but my understanding was that her family situation was complicated and she had expressed a desire to her guardian to remain in Japan.  
我试图回忆我对她的了解。我知道她原本来自德国，但据我所知，作为驾驶员，她已将日本视为自己的家。我只能接触到她有限的档案，但我的理解是，她的家庭状况复杂，她曾向她的监护人表达过希望留在日本的愿望。

I lean back and wonder about my other questions. She seemed to be alone at the time but that doesn't mean anything. She could have been meeting someone in the café or going to meet someone after being in there. As for whether or not she recognized me, she was incapacitated when I went into NERV but I'm sure in all the years that have passed for her someone would have told her about me.  
我向后靠去，思索着其他问题。她当时似乎是一个人，但这并不意味着什么。她可能在咖啡馆里与人会面，或者在那儿之后要去见某人。至于她是否认出了我，我进入 NERV 时她已经无法行动，但我确信，这些年过去了，总会有人告诉她关于我的事。

She didn't seem to recognize me but in the confusion of it all I don't think she had the chance to properly take a look. Still I know myself I'm not exactly normal looking so there is a chance she'll have recognized me.  
她似乎没有认出我，但在那一片混乱中，我想她没有机会仔细看清楚。尽管如此，我了解自己，我看起来并不普通，所以她有可能认出了我。

Fuyutsuki finally reenters the room with a cloth and a handful of paper towels. I take them from him and start to clean up the mess I've made. As I do so I can feel his eyes on me and I wonder if he is angry at me for what happened. I look up and see the same sympathetic eyes I've seen from him since I first met him.  
冬月终于带着一块布和一把纸巾回到了房间。我从他手中接过，开始清理我造成的混乱。在清理的过程中，我能感觉到他的目光在我身上，我不知道他是否因为发生的事情而对我生气。我抬头看去，看到的依旧是自初次见面以来他那充满同情的眼神。

"Nagisa, Is everything okay with you today? You have seemed somewhat distracted all day and it is most unlike you, did something happen at the interview yesterday?"  
渚，你今天一切都好吗？你一整天都显得有些心不在焉，这可不像你啊，昨天面试是不是发生了什么事？

I avert my gaze from him and I actually consider lying to him and telling him I'm fine. It seems embarrassing to admit the truth but I know that if I don't things might get worse. So I swallow what little I have of my pride and shake my head, "I… The interview went fine yesterday, they are eager for me to start."  
我避开他的目光，甚至考虑对他撒谎说自己没事。承认真相似乎很尴尬，但我知道如果我不说，情况可能会变得更糟。于是我咽下仅存的一点自尊，摇了摇头，“我……昨天的面试挺顺利的，他们急着让我开始工作。”

"I see, so what is the issue?"  
“这样啊，那问题出在哪里呢？”

"On the way back from the interview I was going to go into a small café to relax and… there was an incident. I… encountered someone…"  
"从面试回来的路上，我本打算进一家小咖啡馆放松一下，然后……发生了一件事。我……遇到了某个人……"

His expression turns from sympathetic to deathly serious and he steps forward, "Was this someone you know?"  
他的表情从同情转为极其严肃，他向前一步，"你认识这个人吗？"

"Yes… Well no… sort of…" I fumble my words, "I don't know them exactly but I know of them and I fear that I am known to then. I saw… the Second Child… I saw Asuka Langley Soryu."  
"是的……呃，不……算是吧……" 我结结巴巴地说，"我不确切认识他们，但我听说过他们，而且我担心他们也知道我。我看到了……第二适格者……我看到了惣流·明日香·兰格雷。"

"Ah!" Fuyutsuki takes a step back from me and shakes his head, "I see… I was afraid that something like this might happen eventually."  
"啊！" 冬月从我身边退后一步，摇了摇头，"我明白了……我担心这种事情最终会发生。"

"Y-You were afraid of something like this happening?" I ask him and find it hard to hide my surprise, I don't know if I should be angry or not at hearing this, "Did you know Asuka was here in Berlin?"  
"你担心会发生这种事？" 我问他，难以掩饰自己的惊讶，不知道听到这个消息是否该生气，"你知道明日香在柏林吗？"

"He gives a small nod and goes to sit down at his desk, "I am afraid I did know but I did not anticipate any issues. Belin is a vast city and the odds of you two meeting were slim."  
"他微微点头，走到桌前坐下，"我确实知道，但没想到会有什么问题。柏林是个大城市，你们俩相遇的几率很小。"

I finish cleaning my desk and the area around it and deposit the kitchen towel into the small bin before sitting back down at my desk. My hand is still stinging from where the coffee hit it and I try to process what Fuyutsuki has told me.  
我清理完桌面及周围区域，将厨房毛巾丢进小垃圾桶，然后重新坐回桌前。我的手仍因咖啡溅到而刺痛，我试图消化冬月告诉我的事情。

"I must apologize to you Nagisa, perhaps I should have told you before that there was a risk of you encountering her but from what is known of her we didn't think it'd be a factor. Can I ask… did anything happen when you saw her?"  
“我必须向你道歉，渚，也许我早该告诉你有可能会遇到她，但根据已知信息，我们没想到这会成为问题。我能问一下……你见到她时发生了什么吗？”

"No…" I say to him, "I accidentally bumped into her when she was coming out of the café, she yelled at me and I tried to help her up to her feet. When I realized who she was I… I turned and ran away. I don't think she recognized me."  
“没有……”我对他说，“我在她从咖啡馆出来时无意中撞到了她，她对我大喊大叫，我试图扶她起来。当我意识到她是谁时，我……转身跑开了。我想她没有认出我。”

"Perhaps she didn't… A lot of time has passed and I don't think Asuka has ever been properly informed of that period of time. Asuka…" Fuyutsuki bows his head, "Asuka decided shortly after Third Impact to return to Germany and cut off all contact with her former friends and colleagues. We do of course monitor her for her own safety but she wishes nothing to do with us."  
“或许她并不知情……时间已经过去很久，我不认为明日香曾被妥善告知那段时期的情况。明日香……” 冬月低头说道，“在第三次冲击后不久，明日香决定返回德国，并切断了与所有旧友和同事的联系。我们当然出于她的安全考虑对她进行监控，但她希望与我们毫无瓜葛。”

Fuyutsuki stops there and I wonder if there is anything more to the story than he is telling me. I wonder why Asuka chose to leave Japan behind and why she decided to cut off contact from others. I know little else about her, my focus when I went to Tokyo-3 was on Shinji as he was the only other active pilot. I decide now is not the best time to inquire about such things.  
冬月说到这里便停下了，我不禁猜测他是否还有更多未透露的故事。我想知道明日香为何选择离开日本，又为何决定与他人断绝联系。我对她的了解甚少，我在东京-3 时主要关注的是真嗣，因为他是唯一活跃的驾驶员。我决定现在不是询问这些事情的最佳时机。

Fuyutsuki addresses me again, "Again I apologize that I did not tell you that there was a risk of this. If you wish you can take the rest of the day off and we can look into rehoming you elsewhere to prevent such things."  
冬月再次向我致意，“再次为我没有告知你这种风险而道歉。如果你愿意，可以休息一天，我们可以考虑为你重新安排住处，以避免此类事情发生。”

I shake my head, "N-No… I would… This place is my home now and I am grateful to be here and to be able to work here. I want to continue living here. I have very little here but what I do have I like and I don't want to lose it, I would rather stay."  
我摇摇头，“不……我不会……这里现在是我的家，我很感激能在这里，能在这里工作。我想继续住在这里。我拥有的东西不多，但我喜欢我所拥有的，我不想失去它们，我宁愿留下来。”

"Very well." He replies, "If you have any issues please let me know. I don't want to see you hurt."  
“很好。”他回答，“如果你有任何问题，请告诉我。我不想看到你受伤。”

**Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**

**Berlin – Early evening 柏林 —— 傍晚时分**

Why am I doing this? It's a question that I've been asking myself constantly since I left my apartment just under thirty minutes ago. I round a street corner and pull the envelope out of my pocket and pop the small form out. I glance at the address and compare it with the apartment block I'm now stood in front of. This is definitely the right place.  
我为何要这么做？自从大约三十分钟前离开公寓，这个问题就一直萦绕在我心头。我转过一个街角，从口袋里掏出信封，取出里面的小纸条。瞥了一眼地址，与眼前这栋公寓楼对比确认。这里无疑就是目的地。

My hand hovers over the buzzer and I once again ask myself just why I'm doing this. I don't have any answer except that I'm curious. I'm curious as to why Kaworu Nagisa fled from me yesterday, I'm curious as to who he is and how he came back, I'm curious as to why he is in Berlin right now. I continue to stand in front of the buzzer as a certain saying about cats and curiosity runs through my head.  
我的手悬停在门铃上方，再次自问究竟为何要这么做。除了好奇，我找不到其他答案。我好奇为什么渚薰昨天从我身边逃离，好奇他是谁、又是如何回来的，好奇他此刻为何会在柏林。我站在门铃前，脑海中不禁浮现出那句关于猫和好奇心的俗语。

I dread to think what Rei would think or say if she knew I was doing this. My finger finally presses the buzzer and I wait, there is no sound from the device and I press it again. There is still no sound and I look down at the door and see the lock is broken. I shake my head and gently push the door open and step inside the lobby.  
我不敢想象丽如果知道我在做这件事会怎么想或说什么。我的手指终于按下了门铃，我等待着，设备没有发出任何声音，我又按了一次。仍然没有声音，我低头看向门，发现锁是坏的。我摇了摇头，轻轻推开门，走进了大堂。

It would have been so easy for me to just post this to him but for some reason I was compelled to deliver it to him myself. After a bit of walking I finally reach his door, it's an unassuming brown wooden door just like the many others in the hallway. I knock twice and wait, listening out for sounds of movement. I take one cautious step back from the door and prepare for the worst.  
我本可以很容易地直接寄给他，但不知为何，我被驱使着亲自送给他。走了一段路后，我终于到了他的门前，这是一扇不起眼的棕色木门，就像走廊上的许多其他门一样。我敲了两下，等待着，留意着是否有动静的声音。我小心翼翼地后退一步，准备应对最坏的情况。

Yesterday is replaying in my head, how I collided with him and we were both sent spilling to the ground. How he got up and ran from me and how I lost a night's sleep because of it. I think about all those things Rei told me about him in her attempt to fill in some of the blanks. This guy was the last Angel, strange I didn't think they could take human form.  
昨天的一幕在我脑海中重现，我如何与他相撞，我们俩都摔倒在地。他如何起身逃离我，以及我因此失眠了一整夜。我想起了丽试图填补空白时告诉我的关于他的那些事。这家伙是最后一个天使，奇怪的是，我没想到他们能以人类形态出现。

I wonder if I should be scared of him, judging by his reaction yesterday probably not but then what should I feel about him? Should I be angry at him? For doing what he did to… for what he did to a certain other person? For nearly destroying this world. In that way he is no different from me but at least I suppose I was at least honest about what a horrible person I was.  
我不知是否该怕他，从他昨天的反应来看或许不必，但那我又该对他有何感受？我该对他生气吗？因为他对……对某个人所做的事？因为他差点毁了这个世界。在这点上，他和我没什么不同，但至少我想我对自己是个多么糟糕的人还算坦诚。

After a time, I hear the sounds of a lock opening and the door opens slowly to reveal Kaworu Nagisa to me. I'm only able to catch a glimpse of him, it looks like he is still in his work clothes, he's wearing a pair of smart grey trousers, a plain white shirt and orange tie. That is all I'm able to see of him before he locks eyes with me, he jumps backwards and immediately tries to slam the door in my face.  
过了一会儿，我听到开锁的声音，门缓缓打开，露出的是渚薰。我只来得及瞥他一眼，看起来他还在工作状态，穿着一条灰色西裤，一件白色衬衫和橙色领带。在我与他目光相接之前，这一切是我所能看到的全部，随即他猛地后退，试图当着我的面把门关上。

As if expecting him to do that I place my foot in between the door and doorframe and I yelp out in pain as the door collides with my foot.  
仿佛预料到他会这么做，我将脚卡在门和门框之间，随着门撞到我的脚，我痛得叫出声来。

"Wait!" I manage to choke out through the pain, "I'm not... I'm not here to hurt you, you idiot!"  
"等等！" 我忍痛喊道，"我不是……我不是来伤害你的，你这个白痴！"

I realize angrily calling him an idiot might not be too persuasive as he continues to try to shut the door on me. He's strong and I consider withdrawing my foot, letting him shut the door and walking away. Unfortunately for my foot an older part of me has taken over and I'm not willing to let him win.  
我意识到愤怒地叫他白痴可能不太有说服力，因为他继续试图把门关上。他很强壮，我考虑收回脚，让他关门然后走开。不幸的是，我内心深处的一部分已经占据了主导，我不愿意让他赢。

I lean myself up against the door and look around the corridor hoping that no one else here can hear this exchange or comes out right now. The last thing I need is for someone to see me doing this. I push against the door, "Listen to me! I'm not... I'm here to deliver that damn letter you dropped yesterday!"  
我靠在门上，环顾走廊，希望没有其他人能听到这段对话或现在出来。我最不希望的就是有人看到我这样做。我推着门，"听我说！我不是……我是来送你昨天掉的那封该死的信的！"

My words seem to have had some effect on him as I feel the force stop from his end, something my poor right foot is very grateful for. I stay exactly where I am not pushing on the door anymore but keeping it propped open. I'm sure I can hear him take a step away from me before I hear a weak voice, "Could... Could you please post it and leave?"  
我的话似乎对他产生了些许影响，我感觉到他那边的力道停止了，这让我的右脚感到十分庆幸。我保持原位不动，不再推门，只是让它保持敞开。我确信我能听到他后退一步的声音，然后是一个微弱的声音传来，“能……能请你贴好并离开吗？”

This is really the Fifth Child and final Angel? The one who nearly doomed all of mankind? This is the person who made Rei so angry just by seeing his name? I consider his request, maybe I should just leave him alone but again I feel that compulsion to find out more. I want to know why he is so terrified.  
这真的是第五使徒，也是最后的使徒吗？那个几乎让全人类陷入绝境的存在？就是这个人，仅仅因为他的名字就让绫波如此愤怒？我考虑着他的请求，也许我应该让他独自一人，但那种探究更多的冲动再次涌现。我想知道他为何如此恐惧。

I push the door slightly and I see him stood on the far side of the corridor his eyes wide with fear. He backs himself up into the corner like some sort of frightened puppy. I hesitate to move any closer and feel my own heart rate increase. I'm really having this effect on him, I'm really scaring him this much because of this aren't I? I should leave, I should never have come here at all.  
我轻轻推开门，看到他站在走廊的另一端，眼中满是恐惧。他像一只受惊的小狗一样退到角落。我犹豫着是否再靠近，感到自己的心跳也在加速。我真的对他有这么大的影响吗？我真的让他如此害怕，这都是因为我，对吧？我应该离开，我根本就不该来这里。

I stand there awkwardly in the doorway before repeating, "I'm not here to hurt you."  
我尴尬地站在门口，然后重复道：“我不是来伤害你的。”

He looks at me with a look of disbelief and I take a step back. His eyes... they're the same eyes I had seen from another certain person in the past. That fear of the monster I am, does Kaworu know about me then? Does he know what I was? Is that why he is so scared of me?  
他用一种难以置信的表情看着我，我后退了一步。他的眼睛……和我过去在某个特定人物身上见过的眼睛一模一样。我内心的怪物所带来的恐惧，碇真嗣知道我的事吗？他知道我是什么样的人吗？是不是因为这个他才这么怕我？

I weakly smile and hold out the envelope, "Here... Take it, I'll... I'll go. I'm sorry, I didn't realize I scared you that much."  
我虚弱地笑了笑，递出信封，“给……拿着吧，我……我会走的。对不起，我没意识到我吓到你了。”

Kaworu looks at me again before taking a tentative step forward. He slowly reaches out and takes the envelope from me before looking at the form within. I see his eyes light up for a moment and he half smiles at me.  
渚薰再次看向我，然后小心翼翼地向前迈了一步。他缓缓伸出手，从我这里接过信封，然后看向里面的表格。我看到他的眼睛亮了一下，然后对我露出了半个微笑。

"T-Thank you." He says as he takes a step back, "I... I appreciate you bringing this."  
“谢、谢谢你。”他说着后退了一步，“我……我很感激你带这个来。”

I shrug, "Yeah well... it was no big deal. Look I'll just go, I just thought... Never mind... You should probably look at getting that front door fixed too."  
我耸耸肩，“嗯，也没什么大不了的。瞧，我这就走了，我只是觉得……算了……你或许也该考虑修一下前门。”

I turn around to leave and hear him speak, "It is... a big deal to me... I am really grateful."  
我转身准备离开，听到他说：“这对我来说……很重要……我真的很感激。”

I freeze up, some communication finally, "Good."  
我愣住了，终于有了交流，“很好。”

I don't leave my spot in the door yet and wonder If he is about to say anything else. After thirty seconds of awkwardness he does, "I... I should apologize about yesterday... I hope... I did not hurt you..."  
我还没有离开门口的位置，心想他是否还要说些什么。三十秒的尴尬过后，他开口了：“我……我应该为昨天道歉……希望……我没有伤害到你……”

I finally turn around to face him, "It's fine... I just... Why did you run away from me?"  
我终于转过身面对他，“没事的……我只是……你为什么要从我身边逃走？”

He averts his eyes from me, I'm sure I see some redness of embarrassment come to his pale cheeks, "I… I thought you were going to hurt me… That you knew who I was… but you know that now don't you?"  
他避开了我的目光，我确信我看到他苍白的脸颊上泛起了尴尬的红晕，“我……我以为你要伤害我……以为你知道我是谁……但现在你知道了，对吧？”

I nod my head, "I didn't yesterday but I've had a few of the blanks filled in for me now."  
我点点头，“昨天我还不知道，但现在我已经填补了一些空白。”

He glances at me before backing himself up against the wall, "Then you know what I was and what it was I did?"  
他瞥了我一眼，然后背靠墙退后，“那么你知道我曾是怎样的人，以及我做过什么吗？”

I nod again, "Yes I do…"  
我再次点头，“是的，我知道……”

"How much do you know?"  
“你知道多少？”

"Enough. I know that you were sent to NERV to replace me and I know you ended up being an Angel." I tell him realizing there is no point beating around the bush, "I know that you befriended… "  
“够了。我知道你是被派来 NERV 取代我的，我也知道你最终成了使徒。”我告诉他，意识到拐弯抹角毫无意义，“我知道你和他成了朋友……”

I trail off for some reason finding myself unable to say his name. Kaworu is looking at me with a wounded expression, "I know that you hurt him too."  
我不知为何突然说不下去了，无法说出他的名字。渚薰看着我，脸上带着受伤的表情，“我知道你也伤害了他。”

He recoils at my words and shakes his head, "No it was not… I had no choice… I…"  
他听到我的话后退了一步，摇着头说，“不，不是那样的……我别无选择……我……”

He looks directly at me now, "It was too much… SEELE and the compulsions I felt I… I didn't want to hurt him. I didn't want to hurt anyone but…"  
他现在直视着我，“那太过分了……SEELE 和我感受到的强迫……我……我不想伤害他。我不想伤害任何人，但是……”

"But you did." “但你还是做了。”

"Yes… I did…" He admits, "And I regret it, I've regretted it every day since I returned… I should not be here… I should…"  
“是的……我做了……”他承认道，“而且我后悔了，自从我回来后，每一天都在后悔……我不该在这里……我应该……”

"Stop it." I order him not wishing to hear him say these things. It's not that I don't have sympathy for him but because those are the same words I've used countless times in the past about myself. I hate hearing them in my own head, never mind from someone else.  
"别说了。" 我不愿听他说这些，命令道。并非我对他没有同情，而是那些话我也曾无数次对自己说过。我讨厌在脑海中听到它们，更别提从别人口中听到。

I try to move the subject on, "So what are you now?"  
我试图转移话题，"那你现在是什么？"

"I'm as human as you or anyone else is." He answers me immediately. It was just as I suspected and the fear he is feeling starts to make sense. He's not only going to be afraid of me but everyone else. He doesn't have whatever powers he could rely on as an Angel to protect him and his human side has taken over.  
"我和你或其他人一样，都是人类。" 他立刻回答。正如我所料，他内心的恐惧开始变得合理。他不仅会害怕我，还会害怕所有人。他不再拥有作为天使时可依赖的任何力量，人类的特质已经占据主导。

An awkward silence falls upon us as I step further into the hallway, his front door closes extinguishing an amount of the light that was coming in. In the darkness I can still make him out and I can see his red eyes looking towards me reflecting the little light that is coming in from one of the other rooms. Finally he speaks, "W-Would you like to come inside?"  
我走进走廊，一阵尴尬的沉默随之降临。他的前门关闭，熄灭了部分透进来的光线。在黑暗中，我仍能辨认出他的身影，他的红眼睛朝我看来，反射着从其他房间透入的微弱光线。终于，他开口了，“你……你想进来吗？”

His question takes me by surprise and I find myself nodding and following him into his front room. His front room is immaculate, not surprising considering the total lack of anything in it. He has a simple black couch placed in one part of the room with a television opposite. A small coffee table sits in between the two.  
他的问题让我有些意外，我不由自主地点头，跟着他走进了客厅。他的客厅一尘不染，考虑到里面空无一物，这并不令人惊讶。房间的一角摆放着一张简单的黑色沙发，对面是一台电视机。两者之间放着一张小咖啡桌。

On one of the far walls is a small piano with a bookcase next to it filled up with what I presume to be music books. Next to that is a table with a music player on it. There is nothing else in the room, no plants, pictures or ornaments. The walls are a plain and dull white making it look as if he has just moved in here.  
在远处的墙边，有一架小钢琴，旁边是一个书架，里面塞满了我认为是乐谱的书。旁边还有一张桌子，上面放着一台音乐播放器。房间里再无其他物品，没有植物，没有照片，也没有装饰品。墙壁是单调乏味的白色，让人感觉他好像刚搬进来不久。

"How long have you been here?" I ask him.  
"你在这里多久了？" 我问他。

"Almost six months…" He replies, "I… returned in January and spent a month in the facility there."  
"差不多六个月了……" 他回答，"我……一月份回来的，在那里待了一个月。"

Six months here and this is all he has, even Rei didn't take that long to start amassing things. I wonder how Kaworu lives and what he does. He can't just sit and play piano all the time, he can't just listen to music all the time. Does he not have anything else?  
在这里六个月了，他只有这些，连丽都没花这么长时间就开始积攒东西。我想知道渚薰是怎么生活的，他都做些什么。他总不能一直坐着弹钢琴，也不能一直听音乐。他就没有别的事情做吗？

"So you came to Berlin after being in the facility, do you know people here?"  
“所以你离开设施后来了柏林，你在这里有认识的人吗？”

He shakes his head, "I… not really. It was Fuyutsuki… he offered me an opportunity here. I work for him, he's helped me a great deal."  
他摇摇头，“我……不太认识。是冬月……他给了我这里的机会。我为他工作，他帮了我很多。”

I don't know if I should be surprised at that. Fuyutsuki has, since we all returned been making an attempt to make up for what he was a part of. In the early days he visited each of us and ensured we got fair treatment and suitable payouts and support for what we all went through. I can imagine that he is also behind ensuring those people still watch over me, despite me saying I wanted nothing to do with any of them.  
我不知道这是否该让我惊讶。自从我们回来后，冬月一直在努力弥补他所参与的事情。起初，他拜访了我们每一个人，确保我们得到了公正的待遇和适当的补偿，以及对我们经历的支持。我能想象他也在幕后确保那些人继续关注我，尽管我说过不想和他们有任何瓜葛。”

"Fuyutsuki huh? So he is still trying to help people is he… even if they used to be an Angel…"  
"冬月啊？看来他还是在尽力帮助人们，即便他们曾经是天使……"

I feel bad almost immediately after saying it, even more so when I see him flinch, "He has… been very helpful and kind to me."  
我几乎立刻就感到内疚，尤其是看到他退缩的样子，“他……对我非常友好和热心。”

"Good. I'm glad." I state flatly before taking another look around this barren and somewhat alien room. It unnerves me, it's so sterile and basic. It doesn't feel lived in at all.  
"那就好。我很高兴。"我平淡地说道，然后再次环顾这个荒凉且略显异样的房间。它让我感到不安，如此无菌和简陋，完全没有生活气息。

"Thank you once again… for bringing the form I mean. It is… It is really important to me."  
"再次感谢你……我是说，把表格带给我。这对我……真的很重要。"

I shrug, "Don't mention it, so what exactly is it anyway that's so important?"  
我耸耸肩，"别客气，那到底是什么事情这么重要？"

"I am applying to become a music tutor." He wanders over to his piano and smiles, "As you have probably noticed I don't have much here. I… don't really know how to live yet, most of my life was spent in isolation with minimal contact with other people. Music is… one thing I have always had though and playing the piano is one thing I am able to do and I would like to share my gift with others."  
"我正在申请成为一名音乐导师。"他走到钢琴旁，微笑着说，"你可能已经注意到了，我这里没什么东西。我……还不太会生活，大部分时间我都是独自一人，很少与他人接触。音乐……是我一直拥有的东西，弹钢琴是我能做到的事情之一，我想把这份天赋分享给其他人。"

At least he knows what he wants, that is something. I walk over to his piano and take a look at it with him. It's a nice looking instrument but the thing that really catches my eye is the piece that he has displayed on the stand. I have to do a double take, "You're learning Firth of Fifth?"  
"至少他知道自己想要什么，这已经很难得了。我走到他的钢琴旁，和他一起端详起来。这架钢琴外观很漂亮，但真正吸引我目光的是他放在谱架上的那首曲子。我不得不再次确认，“你在学《五度峡湾》？””

He smiles at me, "You know the song?"  
"他朝我微笑，“你知道这首歌？””

I grin, "Of course I know it! It was one of my…"  
"我咧嘴一笑，“当然知道！它曾是我……””

I trail off partway through my sentence and shake my head. I don't really want to explain to this guy I barely know just why that sort of music resonates with me. I used to tell people it's because it was music for smarter people, that the musical complexity was made for people like me and the lyrical depth was something you wouldn't get in their simpler forms of music.  
我话说到一半就停了下来，摇了摇头。我并不想向这个几乎不认识的家伙解释为什么那种音乐会触动我。我曾告诉别人，那是因为这种音乐是为更聪明的人准备的，其音乐复杂性是为我这样的人量身定做，而歌词的深度是他们在更简单的音乐形式中所找不到的。

It was of course all bullshit. The real reason I know and like this song and this sort of music is because my mother liked it. One of the few things I have left of her is her record collection. I would listen to the songs repeatedly, absorbed in the stories they tell and the musical journeys they took me on. It was one of the few things that allowed me to get close to my mother. He looks at me expecting me to finish my sentence, instead I smirk at him, "Play it."  
当然，这一切都是胡说。我之所以知道并喜欢这首歌和这种音乐，真正的原因是我母亲喜欢它。我母亲留下的少数几样东西之一就是她的唱片收藏。我会反复聆听这些歌曲，沉浸在它们讲述的故事和带我踏上的音乐旅程中。这是让我接近母亲的少数几件事之一。他看着我，期待我完成句子，而我却对他微微一笑，"放吧。"

"Play… Firth of Fifth?" "放……《Firth of Fifth》？"

"Yes! Play it! I want to hear you!"  
"好啊！弹吧！我想听你弹！"

"O-Oh but I…" "哦-哦，但我…"

"Oh come on." I challenge him, "You want to be a tutor right? You have to get used to having an audience."  
"哎呀，别这样。" 我向他挑战，"你想当家教对吧？你得习惯有观众。"

"Okay… I shall try…" “好的…我试试…”

I step away from the piano and he takes his seat and looks over the sheet a couple of times. I watch as he stretches his hands out and I watch as his hands hover over the piano keys for a moment. I wonder if he is really going to do it, he seems hesitant but then he nods his head four times and his slender pale fingers come down on the keys launching into the wondrous introduction of the song.  
我离开钢琴，他坐下，几次翻看乐谱。我看着他伸展双手，然后悬停在琴键上方片刻。我好奇他是否真的会弹，他似乎有些犹豫，但随后他点了四次头，纤细苍白的手指落在琴键上，奏出了乐曲美妙的引子。

I remain still, my mouth slightly open in awe as he plays the entire introduction to the song flawlessly. I look and see his face deep in concentration as his hands glide across the piano. It's such a far cry from that frightened puppy of a boy I had witnessed only moments ago. A minute and some later he brings it to an end and I give him some light applause, "Very good."  
我静静地站着，惊讶得微微张嘴，他完美无瑕地弹完了整段引子。我看着他专注的脸庞，双手在钢琴上流畅地移动。这与片刻前那个惊慌失措的男孩判若两人。一分钟后，他结束了演奏，我轻轻鼓掌，“非常好。”

"Y-You think so?" He looks embarrassed by the praise.  
"你-你这么认为吗？" 他对这番赞扬显得有些不好意思。

"Of course! So you like this sort of music?"  
"当然！那你喜欢这种音乐吗？"

He nods enthusiastically, "Very much so, I just find it a shame that many of these artists are no longer active. I have exhausted a lot of their discographies."  
他热情地点头，"非常喜欢，我只是觉得遗憾的是，许多这些艺术家已经不再活跃了。我已经听遍了他们很多专辑。"

I laugh, "Well a lot of those bands were quite turbulent or they changes drastically."  
我笑着说：“很多乐队都经历过动荡或剧变。”

"Yes, this one was no exception, two of their members leaving only a few years apart and their sound changing. Tell me, which era do you prefer?"  
“是的，这个乐队也不例外，两位成员在短短几年内相继离开，风格也发生了变化。告诉我，你更喜欢哪个时期的他们？”

I shrug, "I like both, sometimes I found the earlier stuff a bit too wordy but sometimes the later stuff could be a bit too poppy or droning. There is a lot to like from both sides though."  
我耸耸肩，“两个时期我都喜欢，有时候觉得早期的作品过于冗长，但有时候后期的作品又可能过于流行化或单调。不过两边都有很多值得喜欢的地方。”

"I see, I admit I find myself preferring the older material but later tracks such as Domino, Home by the Sea and Fading Lights are wonderful."  
"我明白了，我得承认我个人更喜欢早期的作品，但后来的曲目如《多米诺》、《海边之家》和《渐暗之光》也非常精彩。"

"They are." I reply and then I'm hit by a strange idea.  
"确实如此。" 我回答道，随即脑海中闪过一个奇怪的念头。"

"Say… Kaworu there is… a band playing nearby tonight… a tribute act funnily enough and they cover only the earlier material. I have two tickets for it and I was going to go with a friend but she unfortunately had to leave to go home earlier today."  
"这么说吧，卡沃鲁，今晚附近有一支乐队演出……说来有趣，这是一支致敬乐队，他们只演奏早期的作品。我有两张票，原本打算和朋友一起去，但她不幸今天早些时候回家了。"

He looks at me, "Oh… That is unfortunate."  
他看着我，“哦……那真是遗憾。”

I can't help but think that for Kaworu it's actually quite fortunate considering just what it is Rei wants to do to him. I probably shouldn't mention Rei right now, a part of me thinks I shouldn't even be doing this but something inside me feels bad for the guy. He's been here six months and it's obvious he hasn't experienced… anything. Going to a concert will be good for him and he'll have me to protect him from anything.  
我不禁想到，对渚来说，这其实相当幸运，考虑到丽想要对他做什么。我或许现在不该提丽，一部分的我甚至觉得我不该做这件事，但内心深处，我为这家伙感到难过。他在这里已经六个月了，显然他什么都没经历过……去听一场音乐会对他有好处，而且有我在，可以保护他免受任何事情的干扰。

"So would you like the spare ticket?"  
“那么，你想不想要这张多余的票？”

"I-I do not know… I… there will be many people there… I…"  
"我…我不知道…我…那里会有很多人…我…"

"You have nothing to worry about, no one knows who you are and besides you're going to be with me. I'll make sure no harm comes to you."  
"你不用担心，没人知道你是谁，而且你还会和我在一起。我会确保你不会受到任何伤害。"

He smiles, "In which case… I would like that… thank you."  
他微笑着说："那么…我很愿意…谢谢你。"
